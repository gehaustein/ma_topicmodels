<p class="contents">The ratification process began in September 2008 when the Serbian Parliament first ratified this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement provides a political, legal and economic framework for cooperation between the European Union and Serbia, and Serbia was unable to continue along the path of European integration without the ratification process getting under way.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, there were no reports of Serbia on the European Parliament’s agenda because the ratification process in the Member States stalled following Serbia’s failure to cooperate fully with the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). To date, eleven Member States have ratified this agreement, which is why, today, I call on the remaining Member States to do the same as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">If, today, we ratify the agreement in this higher assembly, we will be sending a strong and visible message of support for Serbia’s European efforts. That alone, however, will not ensure a successful completion of the ratification process.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on Serbia, on which we will be voting tomorrow, carries precisely this message of support. We need to support Serbia along its long and difficult path to membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As a country which has long been isolated and which has remained outside the modern tide of European politics and economy, Serbia is facing many challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past two years, we have witnessed the political scene in Serbia becoming more pro-European. Serbian leaders will provide us with the best evidence of their sincere commitment to European values and way of life if they successfully resolve problems and implement all the reforms that are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already seen some positive developments. We have sincerely welcomed Serbia’s willingness to compromise and the adoption by the UN General Assembly of a joint resolution on Kosovo in September 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January 2011, Serbia abolished compulsory military service, and generations of young Serbian citizens have been given an additional opportunity to learn, study and develop. Civilian supervision of the armed forces has also been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, Serbia’s advancement towards the EU has very much been hampered by the fact that two individuals indicted for war crimes by the ICTY remain at large.</p>
<p class="contents">Ratko Mladić has been on the run for more than 15 years since the genocide in Srebrenica, that greatest of crimes perpetrated on European soil since World War II.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the statement of the Serbian Government that they consider the finalisation of their cooperation with the Hague Tribunal to be a priority. However, we call on the Serbian authorities, as the main ICTY prosecutor has said, to reduce convincingly the gap between the political will they have shown and concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for Serbia to close this painful chapter and to make a new step towards reconciliation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia will not be able to secure candidate status until it demonstrates that it is fully cooperating with the Hague Tribunal, as stated in the Council conclusions of 25 October 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The most compelling evidence of this would be the arrests and extradition of those who have been indicted. Serbia’s efforts to date to bring this about have not produced results and they remain inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant shifts in regional relations in the Western Balkans, evidenced most of all by the relationship between Serbia and Croatia, have been achieved. We welcome the stance of the Serbian President, whose new approach has given a powerful impetus to a lasting reconciliation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, there are still further challenges. Belgrade must demonstrate a constructive relationship in the upcoming dialogue with Priština and, regardless of the issue of Kosovo’s status, the relationship between Belgrade and Priština must become a partnership, so that the whole region is more easily able to progress towards Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This also holds true for Serbia’s relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Belgrade needs to support the reforms that will enable Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a country with its own institutions, to negotiate on its membership of the European Union. At the moment, that is still not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope, honourable Members, that you will consider me a former Member of this House, and as a guarantee that the Hungarian Presidency will be a Parliament-friendly Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to working with you all during the forthcoming five-and-a-half months of this Presidency, with great expectations. I shall now use my mother tongue. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(HU)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and honour for me to take part in this debate after which Parliament will vote on the approval of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed with the Republic of Serbia. I should also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Mr Jelko Kacin, who drafted an excellent report on the subject, and to warmly welcome the resolution on Serbia’s European integration process. Similarly to other countries in the region, the prospect of European membership has benefited Serbia as well, and the country has made considerable progress in this direction over recent years. In this context, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is an important step forward for Serbia on the road to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement strengthens the already close ties between the European Union and Serbia, and creates a contractual relationship between the two parties. The agreement establishes a new framework for political dialogue. It creates a free trade area and strengthens bilateral economic relations, through which it is intended to bring major economic benefits to Serbia. The agreement encourages the reform processes which will contribute to the growth of the Serbian economy and help Serbia develop a fully functioning market economy. Furthermore, the agreement lays the foundations for increased cooperation in numerous areas to evolve between the European Union and Serbia in the future, last but not least, in the fight against organised crime and illegal cross-border trade, as well as with regard to improving current environmental protection regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council started the ratification process for the agreement on 14 June 2010. To date, eleven Member States, including, of course, Hungary, have endorsed the agreement through their parliaments. We are very confident that all the Member States will ratify it within a short period of time. The Council would welcome the Stabilisation and Association Agreement coming into force by the end of 2011, but by early 2012 at the latest. This would mean that Serbia would enter into an ambitious contractual relationship with the European Union at precisely the time when it starts making more intensive preparations for accession. Your votes will do even more to give prominence to and further this process, due to the unanimous support that was expressed by all political forces at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 1 December. Serbia expressed its commitment to the European Union by its request for accession submitted in December 2009. In October last year, the Council asked the Commission to submit its opinion. This can be expected in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the European integration process has numerous advantages for Serbia. At the same time, Serbia still needs to make major reforms. These include further endeavours in the fields of public administration and the rule of law, justice reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report submitted by Mr Kacin also states, the integration process advances on the basis of the progress made in this area. I welcome the fact that many results have already been achieved. At the same time, I should like to take this opportunity to point out that last year, Serbia took historic steps towards peace with its neighbours in the region. I also welcome Serbia’s close cooperation with the European Union in the summer of 2010 and the resultant UN resolution that opened the way to dialogue between Belgrade and Priština. The Council fully supports High Representative Ashton in the work she has done in this area. This is a major challenge, but the possibility of creating a dialogue offers both Kosovo and Serbia the chance of coming closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to share a concluding thought with you. I am convinced that the European Union must maintain the credibility of the enlargement process. The means of doing this are in our hands. I believe that if the accession negotiations with Croatia can be concluded successfully during the Hungarian Presidency, this will give a very positive sign to Serbia as well that the process is alive, and that the Balkan countries have a place in the family of the nations of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2011 will be an important year for Serbia, which will bring both challenges and opportunities. I welcome the opportunity which this new agreement gives Serbia so that we may build together a joint future in a peaceful Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to express my warm gratitude to the rapporteur for Serbia, Jelko Kacin, for his report on the European integration process of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is a major step forward for Serbia on its path towards the European Union. The fundamental objective of this agreement is to pave the way for further European integration and reforms and to prepare Serbia for European Union membership. This important milestone will serve as an encouragement for Serbia, as it has renewed its efforts to promote reconciliation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Agreement sets up a comprehensive institutional framework through the SAA Council and SAA Committee, a renewed framework for political dialogue, and a network of subcommittees extensively covering most European Union policy areas. Naturally, it also establishes a specific body between this House and the Serbian Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic standpoint, the SAA foresees the gradual establishment of a free trade zone and the gradual integration of Serbia into the European Union’s internal market, thus bringing economic benefits for both the European Union and Serbia. As was the case in central Europe in the 1990s, the agreement will boost investment, in particular, for indirect investments. It will make a key contribution to the growth of the Serbian economy and help Serbia move towards a functioning market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefits of this agreement for the European Union are equally significant. Serbia’s market has now been opened up to European Union exporters. Previously relatively high tariffs will be totally dismantled within a couple of years, with the exception of a few very sensitive agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, by gradually integrating Serbia into the internal market, conditions for investors will become more stable and predictable. Rules on competition and State aid are aligned to those of the European Union. Protection of intellectual property rights is also gradually being brought up to European Union standards. The sizeable Serbian public procurement market is also being progressively opened up to European bidders.</p>
<p class="contents">Forging closer ties with Serbia entails a number of other advantages for the European Union in particular, as it will facilitate cooperation in the areas of justice, freedom and security, the environment, transport and customs, to mention just a few. It therefore helps make the European Union’s policy in south-east Europe more credible and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is particularly noteworthy that Serbia brought forward the implementation of the interim agreement. It officially entered into force in February 2010, but Serbia decided to apply it shortly after it was signed in April 2008. Serbia has thereby demonstrated a commitment to its economic integration with the European Union and has so far established a positive track record.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 14 June 2010, when the Council decided to launch the ratification process for the agreement, nine Member States have notified ratification and two more have secured the approval of their parliaments. Today’s vote by the European Parliament should therefore provide additional impetus for this process thanks to the unanimous support from across the political groups. I hope that ratification by the other Member States will follow soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by focusing on the motion for a resolution on the European integration process of Serbia as a well-prepared contribution to today’s political debate. I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Jelko Kacin. The resolution sends Serbia both a message of support for enhancing EU-Serbia relations, and a message of expectation in relation to the key challenges on Serbia’s path to European Union membership. This is particularly timely in the context of the preparations of the opinion on Serbia’s membership application.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Belgrade last November to hand over a detailed questionnaire to the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister for European integration. The Serbian authorities are currently working hard on their replies, which we expect by the end of the month. I am encouraged by the Serbian Government’s adoption on 30 December of an action plan as a follow-up to the Commission’s progress report. The Commission will thoroughly analyse the replies to the questionnaires and the steps taken by the Serbian authorities in the coming months to complete its assessment with a view to issuing the opinion in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">As my Hungarian colleague said, 2011 is an important year for Serbia: a year of demanding challenges as well as a year of opportunities. The path has been set and the objectives are well known, yet it is up to Serbia to walk down that path, fulfil the required criteria, and, once ready, engage in the negotiation process with the European Union. I am convinced that, with our joint support, Serbia will continue to make the right European choices and move ahead in its integration efforts. This will deliver a positive message for the whole region at a time when we need to reaffirm its European perspective in order to consolidate peace and foster economic prosperity in the Western Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur, Jelko Kacin.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that Serbia has finally made up its mind that it genuinely wants a European future for itself. The majority of the political elite believes that this is the most favourable option. This determination has to be seen in the light of the turbulence of the last two decades. Serbia experienced the end of communism, the collapse of Yugoslavia, the wars that ensued, the rule of Slobodan Milošević, the bombing of 1999, burgeoning mafias and criminality, violence, refugees – a depressing and traumatic history. The decision to opt for Europe, therefore, is a considerable achievement and signals that Serbia has become a factor of stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Two major political problems remain: the arrest and transfer of Ratko Mladić to The Hague, and coming to terms with the independence of Kosovo. Both these point towards psychological barriers. Mladić has his protectors, and the loss of Kosovo is painful for a sizeable section of Serbian society; any loss of territory is painful. To these may be added several other areas that need attention, notably, the upgrading of public administration and of the administration of justice, the establishment of market conditions and full openness towards Serbia’s past, including opening up the archives.</p>
<p class="contents">The auguries for Serbia’s road towards Europe are reasonably good. There is a clear commitment in this direction. The tasks faced by the elite and by society are recognised and the technical preparations are going ahead. If all goes well, Serbia should receive the opinion this autumn and candidate status after that. The road to Europe will not be easy, but Europe as a whole benefits from a stable, democratic Serbia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports the accession prospects of Serbia, a country which has made tremendous progress over recent years and which forms the cornerstone for consolidating peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Parliament’s approval today of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is therefore an historic moment and we welcome it. In the resolution by the European Parliament, we also welcome the accession request filed by this country, but emphasise that other steps still need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clear that the development of regional cooperation is still the Union’s top priority in the Western Balkans. This being so, cooperation between Serbia and the International Criminal Court is an absolute international obligation and must proceed apace, not because Europe wants it, but because the dispensation of justice requires reconciliation with the past and allows relations to be improved between all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that the Serbian people were victims of this war. Serbia is now the country with the highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe; people who need care and housing and to be integrated into the labour market. The Union must provide practical support for all efforts in this direction, especially in light of the credit crisis. We therefore welcome the recent commitment by the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia to find joint solutions to the refugee problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in Kosovo is especially important to stability in the area. We support the dialogue, which needs to start as soon as possible, for the benefit of everyone living in Kosovo, and we hope that it will contribute towards the common European future of the peoples in the region. To close, I should like to congratulate the Vice-President of the Serbian Government, Mr Đelić, on his statement yesterday, to the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, that Serbia is seeking an historic compromise on Kosovo. This compromise really is necessary and we must all help to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Romanian, I cannot but welcome this European path being pursued by Serbia, while also emphasising that Serbia is a European country and its journey towards Europe will not be completed without difficulties arising from a troubled past. However, Serbia must look forward and try to forget the past, because reconciliation with the past must not stand in the way of a future destiny in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress that it is vital for the Copenhagen criteria to be implemented properly, robustly and scrupulously for the whole region, which means Serbia as well, because they alone guarantee respect for European values, the rule of law and viable democracies. I believe that these last two years since the historic decision was made to embark on the European path prove that both the government in Belgrade and the Serbian people are motivated and determined. They wholeheartedly believe in this European project because what else can be more important than European decisions adopted by a government which has not been forced to make these decisions by legal requirements or requirements stipulated by the rules of this political game.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial that Serbia stabilises its economy. Indeed, the signs we are seeing at the moment in the Serbian economy are excellent. It is paramount that it stabilises its democracy. However, a great deal of attention must be focused on multiculturalism in the Balkans, which has been a sensitive issue. The problem of minorities in this region must not be one which will create conflict. I believe that a model promoting assistance and support for minorities and cultural reconciliation is an absolute must. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, therefore, pleased with the current government’s unequivocally pro-European course. However, in my opinion, neither side is exactly going to win any awards for the way in which it has been dealing with the accession process. The EU is simply letting itself be trifled with.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support Serbia’ s pro-European policy, it was granted a visa waiver before it had fully complied with the criteria. Serbia received the Avis in October, in exchange for taking a moderate position on Kosovo. The EU is sending out a message that it is political games, not adherence to the criteria, which will determine the accession process. We should not have to reward Serbia for behaving like a mature European democracy. In fact, we should be able to expect Serbia to take on a responsible role as a regional leader with regard to Kosovo and Bosnia as a matter of course, without having to reward it in the same way that one gives a small child a sweet for being good.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing which we should at least do is stop caving in every time that it comes to the hunt for Mladić and Hadžić. We are talking here about the perpetrators of horrific war crimes and genocide. They should not be allowed to get away with murder. Serbia can, and must, do a lot more to arrest them. We cannot allow full cooperation with the ICTY to become a trifle which may be overlooked in the interests of diplomacy. The verdict on this must rest with those who are in a position to judge whether Serbia is cooperating fully, and that is prosecutor Brammertz. For that reason, I ask you to vote in favour of our amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I was in Serbia last October, I was impressed with the commitment and effort of Serbia’s dynamic, western-orientated democratic government. Serbia certainly has much work still to be done, relating to judicial reform and the fight against organised crime. We in the ECR also hope that Ratko Mladić will be caught and sent to The Hague, though it is by no means certain that he is on Serbian territory. However, it is vital that Serbia’s progress is reciprocated and rewarded by the EU and its Member States, for example, now by ratifying the SSA, not least because some of Serbia’s neighbours, such as Croatia, are far more advanced on the road to EU accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia’s relationship with Kosovo is problematic but not insoluble. I personally believe that an equitable full and final settlement based on partition and the ‘land for peace’ principles we see in the Middle East would be the best way forward. In my view, the EU should properly evaluate this option during the forthcoming dialogue brokered by the High Representative. To dismiss it out of hand would be dangerously short-sighted, and would only perpetuate Kosovo’s state of limbo in terms of international recognition at EU, NATO and UN level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this arises the problem that they do not trust the people of the West, because they regard themselves as people of the East, and they do not trust the people of the East, because they regard themselves as people of the West. In fact, Serbia is a bridge between the east and west of Europe, a key country for European unity, and, ultimately, even the novel by the great Serbian writer, Dobrica Ćosić, ‘A Time of Death’, shows that Serbia is of key importance where the unity or break-up of Europe are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is time for us to realise the fundamental importance of Serbia for European unity. It is the key Balkan economy, and there will be no European unity without the Balkans. I would like to emphasise that we have common tasks that can be addressed relatively quickly, such as the problems of refugees in Serbia (Serbia has some 750 000 refugees on its territory), environmental problems (some of which go back to the 1990s) and the operation of shipping lanes on the Danube (we have a working inter-group in the European Parliament dedicated to the Danube), and we should also aim to assist Serbia in a bold reform of the judiciary and in the fight against organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make two remarks. In order to negotiate the agreement properly and to properly manage the integration process, the European Union should start by identifying and recognising its own interests. Europe has an unsolved Albanian problem, a lack of geopolitical coherence on its southern flank, and a black hole of organised crime and corruption in its Balkan area. This means that at the centre of the Union, there is a need for an enlarged functional and cohesive market and for better transportation corridors in that area. None of these problems can be solved without the contribution of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to avoid treating Serbia as a second-class European country and lecturing it on every occasion. Serbia has indeed committed many sins, but the Euro-Atlantic contribution to the sins committed was also significant. 2011 is indeed a year of challenging opportunities for both Serbia and the European Union. We will not be able to rise to those opportunities unless we leave aside all narcissism and treat Serbia as a peer.</p>
<p class="contents">Only a dignified Serbia can be a reliable partner for a historic reconciliation in the Balkans and a historic reunification within the European Union. Mr Kacin’s report makes a remarkable contribution in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have supported the aim of EU membership for the Western Balkan countries for the last decade, including when I was the Vice-Chair of the Balkans Delegation. I worked closely with our rapporteur in championing visa-free travel and I was delighted when that was secured for Serbia, among others, a year ago. I think this is a really vital contribution to person-to-person contacts and to raising horizons and, ultimately, to guaranteeing security in its wider sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the challenges that are faced by Serbia have already been mentioned. I would like to add something on the challenge of judicial reform. The Commission’s progress report last autumn sounded a note of concern about reappointment procedures being carried out in a non-transparent way, jeopardising the principle of independence of the judiciary and creating a high risk of political influence. That is clearly a key issue in terms of the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague, Mr Kacin told the Foreign Affairs Committee last night that Serbia is doing absolutely everything in its power to locate and apprehend the remaining two indicted individuals and transfer them to The Hague, but Serge Brammertz, the Chief Prosecutor, in his speech to the UN Security Council in September, said that Serbia needed to bridge the gap between its stated commitment to the arrests and the effectiveness of its operations on the ground. We are not seeing results. Serbia needs to adopt a more proactive approach to arresting the fugitives, so I am afraid that there is a gap between rhetoric and reality, and that gap absolutely must be bridged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each country is discrete, of course, but the region is interconnected and the action of each country in the region has a crucial impact on the success of the process itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to point out, once again, that, for us, Serbia’s accession process cannot progress any further without a definite all clear from the International Criminal Court and, as my fellow Member just said, more proactive and, above all, more effective cooperation with the Court on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">There have also been positive developments. One such development was the adoption of the Gender Equality Act, which we were very pleased about. What we want to see now is for its implementation to take place really quickly and we are calling on the Commission to make money available to support this process. If this region wants to grow together, we also need more public transport options in and through the region again. In this regard too, I call on the Commission to provide more support and funding in this area through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), as we are convinced that what is needed is contact between people and not just between leaders. This is very much fostered if it becomes easier for the people of the region to be mobile.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobility is also a question that I would like to just mention quickly before I finish, specifically with regard to the vehicle licence plates that Belgrade continues to issue for seven regions in the north of Kosovo.

His report makes a clear case for a ‘yes’ vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, for all the issues where we continue to criticise Serbia, for all the imperatives for internal reform processes, all the necessity of cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for the issues relating to the fight against corruption, which is particularly far-reaching in Serbia in particular, with mafia mob activities taking place and influencing economic life, the struggle in respect of all of this needs to be fought over the years and this is a condition for Serbia to continue on a positive pro-European course towards membership of the European Union, as they were firmly promised at Thessaloniki, and we need to be true to that promise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say, however, that it is necessary to cooperate with Serbia. You only have to look into the history of the region to know that there can only be lasting peaceful development if Serbia is on board and that we therefore must see Serbia not only as an applicant for future membership of the European Union but also as an essential strategic partner in the sensible development of the entire region and that, for this reason, we should be a source of encouragement and that we should not treat Serbia less well than states that are Member States of the European Union or that are a long way down the road to accession, for whatever historical reasons, be they short or long-term. Given the courage with which President Tadić has fought for a European course and how embattled he is in Serbia, it is imperative that we support these political forces and encourage them so that they are able to show their population that the path to Europe, rather than a nationalistic path, is the right path for the people, too.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would like to invite everyone, and the Member States, in particular, to move forward quickly with the ratification process and, in this way, send a signal that the steps that Serbia is taking towards Europe must be supported so that we can achieve security in the region in the long run. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are elements of a regional collaboration, but a regional collaboration with a great political as well as humanitarian significance. It is therefore very important – and in this regard I fully back what Mr Brok and other Members have said – that we encourage Serbia to continue to take such steps.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this also applies to relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. We all know how important it is that Serbia positively engages – and the same applies to Croatia – in order for that country to hold together and also to carry out the appropriate reforms. In this regard, Serbia really is very courageous here and it is absolutely crucial to regional collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">One critical element that I nevertheless wish to raise is collaboration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). I had, of course, invited Mr Brammertz to attend the working group of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that I chair. We are not completely satisfied in this area – more can be done. Our promptings in this regard have not really been satisfied. I would therefore ask everyone to put pressure on for this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Koppa has already said, this is not just a question for Europe. Serbia must also work on these issues for Serbia itself. Just as there has been this apology in Vukovar, which will undoubtedly go down in the history of the country, the fight against those who have committed major crimes must also continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me give you a few examples: the successful conclusion of the visa liberalisation process, the regional cooperation in the areas of both traffic and energy, a political will to contribute to the reconciliation process in the region and a new political leadership, which was most apparent in President Tadić’s visit to Srebrenica and Vukovar.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these things demonstrate not only the good leadership of particular individuals and Serbia’s huge desire to move closer to EU Membership, but also the decision on the part of the Serbs to choose precisely this sort of leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore pleased that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia is now in place and that we are sending clear signals to Serbia to show that we can see the results of their efforts and that Serbia has a place in the EU family.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly many challenges remaining: the fight against organised crime, continued legal reforms and finding a solution to the minorities issues. Most of these problems are not unique to Serbia, however, but are also shared by the other Balkan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one issue that is rather unique and that needs to be mentioned in this context is the cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The political will exists in the Serbian Government. There is also an awareness of the fact that it is necessary to cooperate with the Tribunal.

<p class="contents">In this one minute, I also have to point out that the different positions on Kosovo within the European Union have encouraged Serbia to make a clear commitment to Europe, which is essential for consolidating peace and democracy in the Balkans and for achieving a constructive approach to regional integration, as demonstrated by the High-Level Meeting in Sarajevo, held on 2 June under the Spanish Presidency.</p>

Concluding the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) and implementing it are the next important steps on this road.</p>
<p class="contents">The Serbian Government should be commended for the actions which have been taken to get to this stage. I am sure that the SAA will bring concrete economic and trade benefits for the country in areas such as environment, energy, transport and many others. Thirteen countries have so far ratified this agreement. I hope that its ratification by the European Parliament will encourage the rest to conclude the process soon.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are still challenges ahead for both Serbia and the EU. Serbia needs to commit to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in bringing the remaining war criminals to justice. There is also an urgent need for progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and for further reforms in the sectors of justice and public administration. Equally, the Serbian Parliament needs to abandon the practices of blank mandates and the arbitrary allocation of parliamentary seats.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo will, I hope, be put on the right track and will guarantee ordinary people better prospects for the future. The European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the integration of the Western Balkans. Serbia is a crucial part of that with this commitment ...</p>

Serbia has clearly demonstrated that it has made a choice to work towards a European future, but it will have to work hard to achieve that. There are a number of stumbling blocks on the road to possible EU membership. On top of that, the last two ICTY suspects, Goran Hadžić and Ratko Mladić, have still not been arrested. Unfortunately, as is apparent in the Chief Prosecutor Brammertz’s report, Serbia has failed to convince the international community that it is putting every effort into searching for these criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">In Brammertz’s opinion, rather than doing its utmost to arrest the suspects, the Serbian Government has, in fact, done no more than the bare minimum that is required of it. What we need is a clear and united message from the Serbian Government. Similarly, it is important that the European Commission be prepared to exert much more pressure. It is also important that the rights of women and homosexuals remain high on Serbia’s agenda. I expect Serbia to pull out all the stops to allow an open process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, Serbia took major steps towards integration in many respects, which the report takes account of as well, and thus I would like to mention only a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these is the question of visa-free travel, which the Serb authorities ought to take very seriously and, in the future, they ought to do their utmost to advise citizens not to abuse this opportunity, as otherwise, the access to European prospects on the part of young people in the future would be impaired, because this visa-free travel – which we have always supported – is precisely about the young generations joining and closing the gap with Europe, and this must not be gambled with. At the same time, Serbia must make immediate progress in cooperating with the international tribunal and must produce results in negotiations with Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I should like to emphasise is the issue of minority rights listed in the Copenhagen criteria. I am pleased that the report has devoted attention to these matters in good time because Serbia must continue its activity in this area: the laws on the status of Vojvodina and on national councils must be put into practice in a manner that enables them to exert their effect in reality. The European Union, however, must learn from the accessions of 2004 and 2007 that these ... </p>

The entry into force of this agreement will open up trade between the EU and Serbia and will offer real prospects for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant progress has been made so far, especially in cooperation with EULEX, in the areas of reforming the judicial system and fighting corruption. At the same time, I believe that the refusal to recognise Kosovo’s independence must not stand in the way of Serbia’s Euroatlantic aspirations. Above all, the Serbian Government has shown its readiness to engage in fresh dialogue with Kosovo under the aegis of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the key role played by Serbia in safeguarding peace in the Balkans. In this respect, I think that it is of paramount importance to continue the open-door policy towards all the countries in the Western Balkans. Romania has supported unreservedly the expansion of this region towards the EU and NATO, with a particular mention for Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by stressing that this country’s efforts and aspirations must be recognised by European states and encouraged at the same time.

The future of Serbia and the Western Balkans is in the European Union. I am convinced that the historical errors and injustices that befell the Balkans in the last century can only be overcome through European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common aim is to change the present borders from lines of separation to lines of unification. It should not matter on which side of a border citizens live, regardless of their ethnicity: whether they are in Niš or in Kalotina, in Caribrod or in Sofia, in Priština or in Leskovac, European integration is the only way to stability, security and prosperity, for Serbian citizens as well as their neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Dr Kacin’s report includes aspects of what has been achieved in Serbia, and what remains to be done. Serbia has our support on its road to integration, and will continue to have it. However, those of us from Eastern Europe can give our Serbian friends some useful advice to prevent them from repeating our mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">One such piece of advice would be to open the files of the repressive communist system in Yugoslavia. In Bulgaria, we have bitter experience of what delays in opening the files entails. The former secret services are closely linked to corruption and organised crime in the region. I congratulate Serbia in its attempts to limit the influence of communist structures in its government. A democratic country’s future should not be controlled by its totalitarian past.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Eastern Europe are clearly aware of manipulation by the former communists, who do everything they can to present their activities as being in defence of the national interest. Do not be fooled. The only thing they are interested in are their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Whoever controls the past also controls the future. Opening the files of the communist secret services will be a clear sign to Europe that Serbia wants to break with a regime that cut it off from Europe for decades. The citizens of the former Yugoslavia have the right to know their most recent history.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish Serbia success on its way to European integration, in which it has our support. We look forward to seeing it in the European democratic family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Serbia takes steps towards the European Union, a huge effort must be made in certain areas, in particular, the improvement of the business environment in Serbia. The experience of Lithuanian investors raises reasonable questions over the business environment and the protection of investments in Serbia. The Serbian Government accused Lithuanian companies, which had invested EUR 34 million, of default and, in violation of the agreement between Serbia and Lithuania providing for investment promotion and mutual protection, terminated the privatisation contract. Serbia must find means of ensuring transparency and a predictable environment for business, and deal with bureaucratic restrictions, legal uncertainty and similar issues.

The case of the young men of Temerin shows a flagrant violation of human rights perpetrated by imposing an excessively severe sentence of a total of 61 years in prison on five young men for a pub fight, which they must serve in third world conditions, tortured and subject to inhumane, cruel treatment.

Especially when it comes to the applicant state of Turkey, it can be seen that the EU operates a double standard. Serbia, after all, is ready to engage in talks with Kosovo even though the EU’s attitude is manifestly inconsistent: in Bosnia, multiple ethnic groups are to be forced into a multicultural State while in Kosovo, it is deemed legitimate for a single ethnic group to hive itself off from a State.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only has Serbia expressed its willingness to talk to Kosovo, but it has also apologised for the genocide at Srebrenica. Yet, despite this, Belgrade continues to be accused of failing to adequately cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The violations of human rights in Turkey, however, where simply discussing the Armenian genocide is enough to merit punishment, are apparently something that can be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The accusation against Kosovar Prime Minister Thaçi of trading in human organs also demonstrates that war crimes cannot be viewed in a one-sided way. These accusations must be fully resolved. For accession to the EU, it is very important that Serbia and Kosovo first resolve their disputes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The support provided by Parliament to the ratification process of the SAA is an important signal for Serbia, and will contribute to intensifying its efforts on the path towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address briefly some questions which were raised during the debate. To Mr Belder firstly, on the Sandžak, I would rather talk about a politicisation of the issue of Muslim representation than a surge of radical Islamism. In that context, we look forward to the next elections to the Bosniak National Council in April this year, which should be peaceful and inclusive and will help foster dialogue and avoid radicalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the Development Fund, we are in close dialogue with Serbia and other countries in the Western Balkan region concerning how to make the best use of the IPA and how to make it even more effective. Reflection is ongoing regarding the support for technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the question by Mrs Morvai, let me say that we pay particular attention to human rights and also to the protection of minority rights. I will write to her addressing one concrete case she referred to in her intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally very encouraged by Serbia’s serious and constructive approach to the current stage of the enlargement process. Where we talked yesterday about concerns, we are talking today about Serbia being on the right track in addressing, for example, the important issue of judicial reform. This is a good basis for Serbia to fully use the integration potential that the year 2011 offers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Excellent observations have been made on an excellent report, and the fact that the majority of the issues raised here have been included in the report demonstrated the excellence of the report to me, so I believe this was an excellent basis for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">You have all confirmed that this is not about a completed process but rather about a beginning. After this beginning, I believe that all the issues which you, too, have raised in the debate will be discussed. Substantial progress has been made, and this is why we have reached the point we are at in the process, and there is still much to do. You yourselves have raised a great many issues, such as deepening democracy, refugees, developing a business environment, problems related to visa-free travel or the situation of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that there has been a major step forward in minorities policy in Serbia, as Mr Tabajdi also pointed out, yet, at the same time, the Copenhagen criteria are in force, and the Commission has drawn attention to this. This is an important pointer for us, and we will watch this closely in every movement and every assessment we make.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been said that the situation is fragile. I fully agree with this, and this is the reason why it is particularly important that we encourage Serbia to carry on along this path. Mr Brok and Mr Swoboda pointed this out as well. I believe that the most essential thing, as Mrs Nicolai also mentioned, is that this is a decision made by Serbia of its own will; that Serbia is committed to the European Union and EU membership, and we will help this process by all possible means. I regard the fact that they have chosen this path of their own volition as a guarantee that Serbia will take all the necessary measures.

<p class="contents">Amongst all the challenges it inherited from the wars of the 1990s, Serbia is now, primarily, in the process of laying down the foundations for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Judicial reform, which began in 2009, remains in many ways incomplete, but that requires systematic rectification.</p>
<p class="contents">The rule of law is the key Copenhagen criterion. Serbia needs to ensure the independence, competence and efficiency of its judicial authorities in order to ensure legal certainty and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome Belgrade’s recent efforts to understanding these challenges. Restitution, that is, the return of confiscated property and the protection of private property, is one element of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the arrival of the speaker of Serbia’s National Assembly, who will visit the European Parliament as early as this month. We need to strengthen the role and responsibility of the Serbian Parliament and all its members.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to be better at attracting the Serbian opposition, which must assume more responsibility for the success of Serbia’s integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">The submission of the Serbian Government’s replies to the European Commission’s questionnaire, which Prime Minister Cvetković will hand over to Commissioner Füle this month, will be an historic step for the Serbian state and for all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this step will be highly significant and successful, which is why I also wish the Hungarian Presidency every success in promoting pro-European forces in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Serbian Government’s European Integration Office, headed by Milica Delević, is doing an excellent job and, therefore, cooperation will not be difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the presence here today of Mr Božo Đelić, the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Science, is proof of the lively interest on the part of the Serbian Government in our work and in Serbia’s future in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to leave you with one thought.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than three years ago, Serbia was on the verge of self-imposed isolation. Today, that danger has passed and Serbia is firmly on the road towards the European Union. At what pace it will progress depends solely on Serbia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution, we are encouraging Serbia along its historic path, and we are sending out a clear message to Serbia that we appreciate its successes and recognise all the challenges it is facing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, I would like to say that most of the shortcomings for which the Serbs are censured in the draft resolution of the European Parliament can be seen to stem from the former years of destructive engagement by some EU Member States in the Balkans, and the direct aggression of NATO against Serbia. We should facilitate Serbia’s entry into the EU, as membership is not a reward for this country, but a chance for the EU to contribute towards solving many of the problems it actually caused, directly or indirectly. I would like to draw urgent attention to the need for a very prudent and balanced approach regarding ethnic minorities in Serbia. The European Parliament draft resolution acknowledges the ‘further aspirations of the Albanian minority’ in Serbia, and speaks of respecting its ‘right to provincial autonomy’. If the problems of minorities are to be ‘solved’ through the creation of collective legislation providing them with special rights, it will be a ‘solution’ with disastrous consequences for the state involved, and that applies not only to Serbia. The only way to secure minority rights is to consistently promote and defend individual human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hungary, at the time preparing for its term of office in the EU Presidency, did not learn from its historic mistake, when it could have made Romania’s accession conditional upon regional autonomy for the indigenous Hungarian minorities of Transylvania. The consequences of this missed opportunity are still being felt to this day: Hungarian cemeteries are being desecrated; a silent genocide of Hungarians is taking place in Transylvania. Through the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Serbia, the European Union and the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs must enforce the protection of minorities. There is great pressure on the European Union to show candidate countries, by concluding and accelerating association agreements, that EU accession is an attainable goal. While Jobbik supports, for example, the accession of Croatia as a country satisfying the criteria, it firmly opposes further, hasty steps made towards Serbia. A far greater degree of autonomy for the indigenous Hungarian minority living in Serbia, including full regional and cultural autonomy, must be laid down as a condition for the continuation of the accession process. We must also not dismiss the idea of allowing the people of Vojvodina to express their will with regard to their regional status through a referendum, thereby alleviating to some extent the indelible injuries inflicted on Hungarians at Trianon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>In other words: ‘Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly what we have done, with you all, these last six months. Belgium, my country, was called upon to assume the rotating Presidency of the European Union after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we were not venturing into totally unknown territory but, even so, it was necessary to establish the criteria for the new functioning of the European Union under the new Treaty, with the new institutions with which the European Union has equipped itself. Therefore, true to the Belgian tradition, the tradition of my country, we did our utmost to enable the institutions to function optimally to create the right precedents.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel able to say to you that the European Union, as it was structured under the Treaty of Lisbon, functions today and functions well. The Union has equipped itself with a new instrument for the supervision of the financial sector, which should hopefully prevent the re-emergence of crises like the one we are still struggling to extricate ourselves from. Economic governance has advanced. Agreement has been reached on the 2011 budget and, most importantly, in total, in those six months, almost forty agreements of a legislative nature were concluded between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our determination to respect both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon was a choice for the future of the Union, an investment in ever closer European cooperation. To achieve this, during this Presidency, we followed two major guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we did not want to push ourselves forward. Instead, we incorporated our programme, the Belgian programme with its five priorities, into the European agenda, into the programme of the Commission, into the momentum generated by the Heads of State or Government at the level of the European Council, into the programme of the troika with our Spanish and Hungarian colleagues. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, as well as not wanting to impose a Belgian agenda, we opted for what I would call an inclusive Presidency. We effectively tried to cooperate as closely as possible with all the European institutions, respecting the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon and playing a role that was actually no more than that of facilitator.</p>
<p class="contents">We cooperated with all parties, obviously with Parliament and the Commission, but also with the new permanent President of the Council, the High Representative and, of course, with Member States, but I believe I can say that, throughout all of our tenure, we paid particular attention to working constructively, and with an open mind, with Parliament, whose powers have been significantly strengthened under the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Some modesty would be fitting today, of course, but I have to say that, together with you, we ensured that this method was successful. Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, today, more than ever, the Union represents an interplay between institutions and Member States. I think that this method has worked and that it can continue to work, because it was and is focused on results and not on image building. This applies to our Presidency, but it also, in fact, applies to the European Parliament, although you must be the judge of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here, I would nevertheless like to express my appreciation and gratitude for your cooperation, on behalf of the Belgian Government and on behalf of my colleagues who have held the rotating Presidency. I believe I can say that most of the agreements we reached were ultimately adopted with a very broad majority. This is a testament to the quality of your debates and – and this should reassure European citizens – the priority you have placed on what is good for Europe, placing it far above national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, those six months are over. Of course, we cannot dwell on the past. Over the coming months and years, we will actually have more to do than ever, because our Union, our society, is facing exceptionally great challenges. I would now like to mention them in brief.</p>
<p class="contents">The first challenge, obviously, lies in the continuity of what we have started over the past six months, namely, economic governance. Since those six months began, we have worked together to take the measures necessary to avert a crisis in the euro area. However, countering the symptoms that have been in evidence so far is not enough. The threats which a number of the countries in the euro area have been facing have shown that a monetary union cannot, in fact, work on its own without an economic union, without greater economic convergence. We must therefore press on with determination along the road of greater economic cohesion, more cohesion in the fiscal, economic and social policies of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic governance also requires rigorous monitoring of the budgetary and structural policies of the Union’s Member States. We need to make full use of the European Semester which was established with that purpose in mind. A return to budgetary discipline should not just be a non-binding target; it must be verifiable and, if necessary, enforceable at a European level. This is obviously not about discipline for its own sake; sound public finances are an absolute necessity if we are to establish sustainable growth again, a credible growth that creates jobs for our citizens. Those jobs are, of course, essential for the maintenance of our very specifically European social model, which goes hand in hand with political and economic freedom, social solidarity and ecological responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) </span>The Union must use the new instruments that it is introducing in order to monitor the financial markets efficiently. These instruments are supposed to be ready for use by the end of this year. That is an absolute must in order to prevent any new derailments of the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic convergence, monitoring of the national budgetary and structural policy options, new instruments for financial market monitoring – all of this may give the impression that the apparatus of the Union is on the way to becoming pretty heavy-going and complicated. Of course, it is also to be expected that closer monitoring of the national political decisions of the Member States will not proceed without discussions and sources of friction. Yet that should not put us off, as it forms part of the essence of European integration. </p>
<p class="contents">The second field in which we must do this – in which we must keep up the momentum – is that of the Union’s role in the world. We have made progress in that field. Thanks to our concerted preparation and unified representation, we have indeed increased our weight in the G20. In the last months, the Union has started to build its own diplomatic representation all over the world. These moves are good but they have to be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, it is true, speaks with one voice on most problems in the world, but words are not enough. The Union must indeed develop more clout, it must be able to act in a decisive manner and to become a real pole of influence and power in this multipolar world.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to address the financial perspective of the Union. It is true that this is not a time when governments can contemplate hefty increases in their contributions to the Union budget, but neither can we avoid a debate on the long-term financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Promises have been made to this Parliament that there will be consultation on the philosophy of the Union’s future financing and on ways and means. The Union cannot live hand-to-mouth: it has to have this long-term perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I want to say that we will be able to deliver on these challenges only if, more than ever, we believe in ourselves. I would like to quote the French thinker and writer, André Frossard, on this challenge for the coming years. I will first quote in French, and then translate: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> ‘Europe quite rightly wants to equip herself with a common policy and currency but, most of all, she needs a soul’. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe quite rightly wants to equip herself with a common policy and currency but, most of all, she needs a soul’.</p>
<p class="contents">We do indeed need a soul, colleagues. We need to have faith in ourselves and in what we have accomplished, and not to excuse ourselves for who and what we are. We need to remember that, before being a market, before being a currency, before being a set of institutions, the Union – our Union – was a vision, a belief, a dream. It was a dream of peace on this continent, which has been torn by so many wars.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard that it has become a little bit <span class="italic">passé</span> to speak of peace to generations in Europe who have never known war. I can only say: ‘Look around you’. Watch all the refugees, for instance, who come to us fleeing war, fleeing armed conflicts, fleeing tyranny. Those refugees certainly do not look down on the achievement that it is to have spread peace and security across almost the entire continent. And those refugees – those people – aspire, like so many people elsewhere in the world, to the rights and freedoms which too many of our citizens take so easily for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">As much as the Union is about peace, it is also about liberty, about democracy, about fundamental civil rights and about the rule of law, for our citizens as well as for our immigrants. We believe in the right of each person to human dignity, which means people’s right to live on their feet and not on their knees, and the right to think and speak and worship freely.</p>
<p class="contents">In a much quoted statement, Jean Monnet said that nothing gets done without people, but that nothing lasts without institutions. This is just as true today as when he said it but, on the other hand, it is also true that institutions will wither if they are not carried by people with strong convictions. We must remember that we will carry our citizens with us only if we give them a vision: if we give them a dream.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish Hungary all possible success now that it has taken over the baton of the Presidency. I am sure it will hold high the torch of the European dream of peace, the European dream of freedom, and the aim of an ever stronger Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, with efficiency and focus, with pragmatism and Community spirit, the Union made important advances during the Belgian Presidency, which deserve our admiration and our recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European Commission, I would like to offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Prime Minister, Mr Leterme, his entire government team, the administration, and all the Belgians who gave their very best to ensure the success of this Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a fine and great Presidency at a delicate and challenging time for the future of the European Union. Rarely had the challenges been so important and the difficulties so crucial to overcome. Throughout those long months of sound and fury – if you will forgive the expression – the Belgian Presidency held firm to the course of European politics. Its action was always embedded in the fundamental sense of the existence of the European Union, the solidarity of everyone in the general European interest. Its action also enabled us to chart the best way forward to achieve our primary objectives: stability and the relaunch of job-creating growth.</p>
<p class="contents">They were months during which Europe was still living to the frenetic rhythm of developments in the financial crisis and in sovereign debt. All eyes were on the future of the euro area and on our determination to defend it. When we say that we will do everything possible to defend the stability of the euro area as a whole, these must not be empty words. It is nothing more and nothing less than the expression of our firm political will to defend our common destiny. The future of the euro area and the future of the European Union are two sides of the same coin. We want this future to be stable and prosperous for ourselves and for future generations. That has always been, and remains, the meaning of European integration and of the Community spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental reforms to which we have committed ourselves show that we are fully aware of the challenge facing the European Union. We must adapt to the new political, economic and strategic realities of a rapidly changing globalised world. We must achieve this adaptation while reaffirming our values, defending our interests and enhancing our credibility and influence on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic decisions we have taken on strengthening European economic governance and tackling our macro-economic imbalances are at the heart of this progress. They are not an option but an imperative. I hope that, during this six-month period, the European Parliament and the Council will adopt the proposals on economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally, the question is not who among the different political stakeholders in Europe emerges a winner or a loser, but whether each of us is prepared to cooperate in full respect of our mutual prerogatives. In essence, the question is whether the European Union as a whole emerges a winner or a loser. The answer is clear: if we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will all be losers, both in the euro area and throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will lose the battle for stability, growth and employment in Europe. If we do not strengthen our economic governance, the strong links of today may become the weak links of tomorrow. And if we do not strengthen our economic governance, we will lose our credibility on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">While issues of governance and macro-economic imbalance are also global issues and are discussed, notably at the G20, how could we remain credible and influential with our international partners if we were not even capable of resolving them at EU level? I say this weighing all my words carefully: essentially, it is an existential question for the European Union. We act and we assert ourselves as a Union, or we fail to act and allow ourselves to be marginalised. What is really at issue is our collective destiny.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, fortunately, moving towards self-assertion. I would therefore like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency most sincerely. The agreement obtained at the ECOFIN Council on 17 September resulted in the establishment of new cycles of economic governance, known as the European Semester. The first step was taken last week with the presentation of the annual growth review prepared by the European Commission, in which we make very clear that the three priorities we need to focus our efforts on are reinforcing macro-economic stability – in particular, through rigorous fiscal consolidation – structural reform and job-creating growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We also achieved notable successes in financial supervision, in particular, by adopting a new European architecture of financial supervision, which came into existence on 1 January 2011 with the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board and of three new financial supervisory authorities covering the markets, the banks and insurance, respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In those six months, we were also able to obtain agreements on the management of speculative funds and other alternative investment funds as well as on the rating agencies. For our citizens, austerity measures are not a vague concept but the harsh reality of their daily lives. There are, across Europe, many worries and concerns, but there are also, across Europe, high expectations that the reforms, postponed for far too long, will finally be completed, that the European dimension will be an integral part of the solution, and that Europe will defend its projects, its values and its interests in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to spread the word as widely as possible about what the Union is doing to restore growth that is sustainable and able to create jobs and to build a European society that is fairer and more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point to some other achievements, in particular, with regard to foreign policy and external relations. One such achievement is the free trade agreement signed with South Korea on 6 October, which is, quite simply, the most ambitious commercial agreement ever concluded by the European Union, and which must remain a benchmark for our future bilateral commercial agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to the expectations of some pessimists, Cancún also managed to show some progress towards multilateralism in the fight against climate change. Cancún also demonstrated the importance of cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission to enable Europe to speak with a coherent and audible voice on the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards practical results, I should also like to commend the agreement finally reached during the Belgian Presidency in the field of transport on the Eurovignette dossier. This is very important for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to the Belgian Presidency for the exemplary way in which it enabled the major innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon to be respected and implemented. It used all its negotiating skills to brilliant effect during a difficult discussion on the 2011 budget of the European Union under the new budgetary rules of the Treaty. It was an illustration of the European spirit and of its culture of compromise at its finest. The Commission is proud of the contribution it made to this outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, in fulfilment of my commitments to Parliament, I will have an initial meeting with the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, and Prime Minister Orbán, who holds the rotating Presidency of the Council, to discuss the next steps to be taken in budgetary matters.</p>
<p class="contents">2010 was an often difficult and, at times, extremely demanding year. Ultimately, however, it was very productive. It was under the Presidency of two countries, Belgium, but also Spain, that European integration was able to move decisively forward. I see in it the strength of our Union and the proper functioning of our institutions. It is now up to the third country in the troika, Hungary, to maintain this momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">The important decisions that we have taken over the past year are proof that all of us, Parliament, Council, Commission, Member States, know what we have to do to ensure a stable and prosperous future for Europe. If we know what we have to do, we have to do it now. We have said that we have the will to do it; we must now show that we are indeed capable of honouring our political commitments without diluting them, without weakening and without allowing ourselves to be fooled by tentative signs of recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to consolidate our actions, to show that they are not a reaction to the pressure of the crisis in the markets, but rather the strong reaffirmation of our will to live together in this Union for peace, solidarity and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You and your colleagues, Mr Prime Minister, can lay claim to a remarkable series of achievements. Rather than commenting on the specific achievements, I would particularly emphasise the gold standard that you have set for the Presidency. After all, the Belgian Presidency of the Council was the first to have held office entirely within the new institutional framework of the Treaty of Lisbon. That in itself was a challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty has radically changed the institutional framework, as I have already stated in my report on the previous term. Thus, the European Council and the Council have now clearly become two separate institutions, each with its own Presidency. One other thing which is new is that the Treaty uses exactly the same wording to describe the mandate of the Council as it does to describe that of Parliament. One cannot shake off the impression that some members of the Council have had some difficulty in adapting to the new relationship between Parliament and the Council. That was obvious during the budget debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this cannot be said of the Belgian Presidency. In consultation with the Commission and Parliament, it has mainly invested its efforts in the realisation of the European Legislative Agenda. European priorities were always paramount in this. That also partly explains the success of the Belgian Presidency. In the past, presidencies have too often tried to assert their national priorities over European agencies. This is not the case here and, therefore, Europe has made real progress during this Presidency. The difficult budget debate during the Belgian Presidency also set the course for one of the most difficult challenges facing the Union in years to come, namely, the establishment of the new financial framework. Belgium received a pledge from the previous presidencies that Parliament would be involved in the debate on this multiannual financial framework. For its part, the Commission undertook to formulate, in the framework of its proposal for the multiannual plan, proposals for the Union’s own resources, and it is essential that that is done. Parliament will therefore ensure that both the Commission and any forthcoming Presidencies adhere to these commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to the Belgian Presidency, I have to say that it delivered excellent work – many thanks for that, therefore. It did this despite difficult conditions – the political situation at home is not exactly easy, of course, the Treaty of Lisbon is new and even the relationship with the European Council is not all that easy. The Belgian Presidency had a clear focus on Europe, however. It wanted to take Europe forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Hungarian Presidency, in contrast – up to now, at any rate – we have seen a Presidency that pays more attention to its domestic affairs, in other words, to holding on to power at home, specifically in connection with a very controversial media law that we will also be discussing at a later date. I hope that Mr Orbán will take a very close look at how the Belgian Presidency went, and perhaps follows its lead somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Leterme, you spoke of economic governance. In this regard, I can but fully endorse what Mr Barroso had to say. All there is is an either/or situation. Either there is another crisis-provoking development in Europe – and not only in the euro area – or there is an attempt to create efficient economic governance based on cooperation between all the Member States, but also based on strong action taken by the Commission. You know, Mr Barroso, that you have our full backing in this regard. You achieved much in this area, Mr Leterme, but we need to go further now, and we need to take the next steps.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that this is primarily about tax, fiscal and social cooperation. That takes me to the second item where this Belgian Presidency very much excelled, namely, the social dimension. I think we all have an interest – though perhaps with differing emphases – in this social dimension being developed accordingly. Social Europe does not mean that every last thing is done in Europe’s socio-political sphere; rather, it means, for example, the things that you talked about and achieved in relation to fighting poverty. It is scandalous to see that poverty is actually rising in Europe to some degree. The same applies to what you said about the increasingly disparate distribution of incomes. In your Presidency, you made clear that this is not only a social issue; it is also an economic one. More poverty and more social inequality also translate to a loss of competitiveness. That has been proven economically, financially and empirically. The things that you said are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Also important are the things that you said about the Europe of the citizens. You delivered a tangible contribution, along with Mr Šefčovič and Members of this House, in bringing about the European citizens’ initiative. This will be a major step forwards if it is also used appropriately by pro-European forces to bring Europe closer to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we wish Belgium all the best for the future, too. It is not without importance how the actors on the political stage behave. I hope that all the political forces in Belgium attempt to find a real consensus. It is difficult to tell people in a crisis-hit region that they should just reach a consensus, that they should just work together on important issues, when this is not possible in Belgium – one of the heartlands of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I wish you all the best. In many ways, you represented an exemplary Presidency. I hope that other, subsequent Presidencies follow your example.</p>

We should keep matters separate, or else Prime Minister Leterme will have to comment on the new media law in Hungary, and I do not believe that that is his responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, is to pass and monitor legislation, which therefore means being critical when things go wrong, when things are in a bad state, but also giving praise when things actually turn out well. We could say that the Belgian Presidency has been good, very good, and that it has been a success thanks to the efforts of many people: the Belgian Government, but also many diplomats, the Permanent Representative, the Deputy Permanent Representative and all those who have worked every day to make it a success.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a success which no one foresaw, because, Mr Prime Minister, all of us were constantly confronted with the following question from our constituents: how can a caretaker government make for a successful Presidency? In my view, it was the first time that we had ever had a real European government, because it was a government which concerned itself only with European affairs and European issues, and which was not distracted by the affairs of its members’ own nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is almost an invitation to other governments to be caretaker governments when they take over the Presidency of the European Union, so that they can concentrate on Europe for six months instead of occasionally squeezing it in between other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Belgian Presidency was successful mainly for one reason (look at the financial supervision, the hedge funds, the rating agencies): because this Presidency understood that, under the new Treaty, we need to be working towards ‘more Europe’ and because it pushed for ‘more Europe’ in the Council. That cannot be said of all presidencies. Jean-Luc Dehaene is right when he says that there are, indeed, a number of Member States that still do not understand that the ground rules have changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The ground rules have changed and the Belgian Presidency is the first to have grasped that that is the case. If we have ended up with an arrangement for European supervision whereby the objectives of the European Parliament have finally been attained, then that is because the Belgian Presidency told our colleagues in the Council: ‘That will not work, it has to be a European solution’, unlike the solution developed by the finance ministers in December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say the same about the European patent. Now, that was a major breakthrough, Mr President. I would call on you and all other members to give the green light for that patent to the European Parliament very soon, so that, after more than 20 years, the European patent can finally become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, I welcome this and I congratulate you. The Belgian team did a good job and this is a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am of the opinion that the opposition you encountered in the different Councils in fact resembles the opposition we encounter in the Belgian debate: solidarity, transfers, all these issues relating to withdrawal or contribution are things that we are very familiar with in Belgium and that you encountered in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr Barroso, since you expressed your admiration and your acknowledgement, perhaps, at some time in the future, the European Union could give Belgium a nudge in the right direction or a bit of a helping hand. Since Belgium helped the European Union, perhaps the European Union could help Belgium to unblock its federal stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, to come back to a few specific issues, Prime Minister, notably the issue of the budget, one has greater responsibility on leaving the Presidency than on entering it. Therefore, as regards the budget, my opinion is that we doubtless lacked boldness by not embracing the proposal for a convention we could have made on the financial resources, but the issue of own resources will be a central issue in the months ahead and I am very much counting on Belgium – which will recover, if you like, its freedom of speech, since it no longer represents all the Member States but speaks for itself – to take this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue is the European constituency. It is something that will come before the Council at some time in the future. I know that, in Belgium, there are some who do not want a federal constituency, but I think that it is necessary, and perhaps it is precisely because they do not want it in Belgium that Belgium wants it at European level. A European constituency would be extremely useful in guaranteeing what you call the ‘soul’ of the European Union, i.e. the fact that, there, European citizens can, quite simply, consider themselves citizens who can vote for more than national representatives. I think it is a very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">And the third issue, which has already been mentioned, is the Citizens’ Initiative. Here too, I am very much counting on Belgium to speed up the implementation process. It is an important instrument alongside all the economic governance reforms and I hope that Belgium may also contribute to moving the process forward more quickly and more strongly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You would not think that the incumbent Belgian Government was resigning. When I look at the dossiers that I am qualified to assess, the balance is positive. An agreement on the regulation of risk capital, a regulation on the supervision of financial markets and a budget for 2011. I am very familiar with both Belgium and Europe. European politics is, as it were, an extension of Belgian politics, with a greater purpose. It involves the search for compromises through conversations and long lunches and, if necessary, a bit of gentle cajoling in the interests of achieving a result.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who therefore say that Belgium is Europe in miniature. That is exactly where the danger for Europe now lies, because the Belgian system is itself no longer able to keep functioning on compromises. There is not even a successor to Mr Leterme in the pipeline. If Belgium is the future of Europe, then we must ask ourselves: why is the Belgian system coming to an end? Why is it in a state of dissolution?</p>
<p class="contents">The explanation for this, in my view, is that Belgium has created a transfer economy which is no longer affordable. In the name of solidarity, we created a cash flow from Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels, but, Mr Barroso, if solidarity is all one way, then people become alienated from one another and that is what we are now witnessing in Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we in Europe are busy planting a transfer economy. You have been doing this and, as a result, the euro has already been misused. Now we are faced with a call for eurobonds. Mr Verhofstadt calls for that on a daily basis. Look also at the Euro Emergency Fund, which is beginning to resemble a <span class="italic">Ponzi scheme</span>. First, it was temporary, then it was permanent, and now we have to keep pumping more and more money into it. One of the casualties of this will be competitiveness, as foreign investments in Europe will decline. Those who want to see the Europe of tomorrow should look at the Belgium of today! Then we might imagine Germany in the role of Flanders, saying: ‘We no longer want to keep paying for everybody else’. Some of you will laugh at this, but that danger is closer than you think. Let this be a wake-up call for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Leterme, I have always had a great deal of respect for you. I wish you every success in whatever it is that you go on to do, but I fear that Belgium will retain you in your current post for a while yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You did nothing about this. Not only was there no initiative to protect services of general interest, but today, under the strengthened Stability Pact, we are entering a worrying spiral where, in order to reduce the debt of Member States, the vultures of the financial markets and of their rating agencies are driving Member States to sell off their public goods, which are, however, an asset for justice and equality.</p>
<p class="contents">As for social issues, all the vigilance of Parliament was required to ward off the increase in working time for lorry drivers or the so-called ‘single permit’ project, expanded version, of the Bolkestein Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We were in the European Year for Combating Poverty. There is not one single poor person fewer in the European Union; there are more and more! And it has to be recognised that the anti-crisis measures are ineffective because they dissipate social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy adopted continuously entails reassuring the creditors of Member States that are heavily indebted because of a reduction in taxation on capital and a decline in growth due to a fall in purchasing power and austerity – a word that I heard mentioned for the first time by Mr Barroso. And, to that end, you now want to check the budgets of the Member States <span class="italic">a priori</span> in the place of national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">You surreptitiously initiated a review of the European treaties, which you told us yesterday were inviolable. Yet you continuously refused to initiate a debate on the setting up of a social and environmental development fund financed by a tax on capital movements and the upward harmonisation of taxation on capital, on the creation of money by the European Central Bank for the repurchase of the debt of Member States, and on the development of public services that are crucial for justice and social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of your Presidency, you said, Prime Minister, that you wanted a sober Presidency, and this was very much to your credit. However, during your Presidency, it has to be recognised that the financial markets and the large shareholders have been satisfied. The people themselves are increasingly living in poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, in passing, to comment in response to the gauntlet thrown down by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, who said that we shall need, through global economic governance, to help him prove what Europe is. It is a single economic, cultural and perhaps also political force. That is why we must all support the Commission, so that Europe continues to be a major force.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Belgian Presidency is concerned, it is generally admitted that it was a very successful Presidency. I should like to add two points to what has already been said, which were not mentioned here and which underline the success of the Belgian Presidency. First of all, Belgium functioned in a completely European way; in other words, it followed the Commission’s and the European Parliament’s agenda. The presidencies usually add national issues. Belgium set a good example, demonstrating that we are Europe and we follow the agenda set by the Commission. It had no ambition to add its own agenda. The second commendable point of the Belgian Presidency was the model it applied; the model of trialogue and tripartite cooperation between the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.

The European Commission and Parliament are relieved that the Belgian Presidency is over and that no major accidents have happened. Indeed, an artificial country with no government, a country which is not even capable of governing itself, is hardly the obvious candidate for taking over the Presidency of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">One could, of course, say that you and the ministers have had plenty of time to deal with the Presidency, given that you were only running a caretaker government. One could say that you have benefited from diplomats who have done their job well and that the importance of the rotating Presidency has decreased since the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">All that might be true, but I think that your best decision was to heed the advice of Vlaams Belang and, in particular, to adopt a low profile. You could have made the same mistakes as the previous Belgian Presidency in 2001. Just consider the failed ‘praline summit’ in Brussels, the build-up of diplomatic blunders and what has become known as the Laeken Declaration which ultimately led to the debacle of the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is not the case that the Belgian Presidency has achieved a clear round: first, there was the incident where the socialist Minister for Pensions, Daerden, chaired the Council of Ministers in a state of inebriation – Commissioner Andor’s face speaks volumes; the Flemish taxpayer <span class="italic">and</span> net payers are no longer able to laugh at this, in the knowledge that this character is now responsible for their pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there were the desperate attempts by the Foreign Minister, Mr Vanackere, to open a new chapter in Turkey’s accession negotiations, at any cost and against the will of the people, when Turkey should not even be being considered for negotiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Belgian Presidency has been excellent. I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester. Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened next is not very reassuring. We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant. They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking.</p>
<p class="contents">In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority. The alternative would not make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks. Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds. This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. …</p>

To be honest with you, this has been a somewhat uneventful debate, but also one that we can take pride in, and so I happily join my fellow Members’ chorus of praise for the Belgian Presidency. Yves, your team, your ministers, and also your political and diplomatic corps have done a fantastic job. I was able to experience this first-hand. I have had the joy and pleasure of participating in two trialogues on the environment and – no, you must not let this go to your head, though this time you <span class="italic">will</span> receive a little praise – here I wish to compliment you on the intelligent way in which you have discharged the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have a major and a minor ‘but’ to add to those words of praise. My first ‘but’ has to do with social policy; in my opinion, we have made progress on a number of social dossiers. Nevertheless, we have to be honest and say – and I am not laying this at the Belgian Presidency’s door, but at that of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion – that European interest in these issues is not great. We have not made any real progress in legislative matters, when it comes to the European minimum income, for instance, and thus there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">My second ‘but’ has to do with the role which the Belgian Presidency has played in the post-Lisbon period. I have received congratulations from Messrs Verhofstadt and Dehaene, two former prime ministers who are exceptionally knowledgeable about institutional matters. There is, however, a downside to that role, especially the Belgian Presidency’s lack of political leadership on some really critical dossiers. There was some sitting back and doing nothing and Mr Van Rompuy ought to have taken the lead on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the debate on economic governance and to the debate on the debt crisis in the European Union. Other Heads of Government – not to mention Prime Minister Merkel and President Sarkozy – <span class="italic">did</span> take on these issues. This, in my view, led to limited results at the last Council, because of the debt crisis, amongst other reasons. In the past, the Belgian Presidency did assume political leadership and I would hope that the next government will indeed assume that leadership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has been said – and it has sometimes been intended as a joke – that the Belgian Presidency did well because they had heaps of time and were able to focus all their energy on the Presidency. For example, Mr Verhofstadt said that it was the first time that Europe had had a full-time government. I would agree with that.

If I were to present the Golden Shoe to the Belgian Presidency, to the best actor in the Belgian Presidency, then it would, without any doubt, go to the Belgian diplomatic staff, to the people who are seated behind you and who have ensured that you, your team and the regional government have indeed done a cracking job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as I listen to this debate, two rather important questions arise. Is it really the case that during the Belgian Presidency, everyone in Europe forgot about national interests and focused only on those interests determined by institutions in Brussels and supported by the Belgian Government? This certainly was not the case. We have been watching events in Europe over the last six months and it can be seen clearly that just because a Presidency does not make reference to national interests, it does not mean they do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">And a second thing, which is, perhaps, the most fundamental and the greatest doubt in this whole debate: it would not be a good thing if we contrasted what we are calling here European objectives with what we are calling national ones. After all, the national goals that we are talking about are ideas that come from specific countries. This is a specific contribution without which Europe would be far worse off. We cannot impose a standard in which these goals, which are formulated in specific Member States but for Europe, are not treated as an asset but as a problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am here, on your left, Mr Prime Minister. I need to have a frank conversation with you. I have a text in Portuguese but I am going to improvise in English because that was the language you used in what, for me, was the most important part of your speech, when you said: ‘look at refugees. Look at the refugees if you think that war and peace is not important for Europe’. You were addressing the new generations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that my heart jumped when you said that, because I am the European Parliament rapporteur for refugees. During your Presidency, you could have done more than look at refugees. You could have done something to help; it was not difficult. The Council could have finished the codecision procedure which Parliament started on resettlement of refugees. In our part of the codecision, we increased the money that we give to Member States to resettle refugees; we established categories of priorities for people who have been raped, who have been tortured and who have diseases, and who are waiting in camps to be resettled. The Council has not completed the codecision. It seems that it was because of Article 290 and delegated acts – something which is in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">You say: ‘look at refugees’. But I challenge you to do what we did, go to the al-Hol camp in Syria. Then tell refugees to look at Article 290, look at delegated acts. They will say: ‘what are you talking about? My kids are not going to school; I do not have a passport; we are stuck in a refugee camp; why are you talking about a minor institutional problem when you could have done something to help our problem?’ This will tarnish the Belgian Presidency. I am sorry to say this; I say it in sadness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, you are selling yourself short by calling yourself a ‘facilitator’, for you have been the driving force and have managed to overcome differences, including those which you have had with this Parliament, in a creative and committed fashion. Thanks to you, we now have robust European supervision, a directive regulating alternative investment funds and also the Eurovignette, another difficult bargaining chip which has ended with a clear Council conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, from the European spirit which infused your speech here in Parliament, I can see that you are also looking ahead. I would like to emphasise one point in your speech, in particular. You rightly say that economic governance should not result in a situation where we are merely treating the symptoms without doing anything about the risk which is still out there because, while a robust Stability and Growth Pact might well become a reality, it is only one mainstay of that economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want for our citizens is for us to be able to come out the other end of this economic crisis altogether and again be in a position to create jobs for our citizens and young people and, in order to do that, we need robust European macro-economic supervision and a very strong European 2020 strategy. Will the European Semester really make that happen? Will Member States commit themselves to fleshing out economic governance in this area as well? As Parliament, we should take full advantage of our colegislative role in the governance package, the legislative package, in order to make that a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that I had hoped I would be wrong and, without wishing to offend you, Prime Minster, like all Belgians, I would have liked to have before me today the Head of Government duly elected at the ballot box on 13 June. However, you were the one who had to take on this Presidency, and I congratulate you and all the ministers of the present government.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, let us leave aside the internal political situation to focus on the outcome of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, would like to quote a famous American, who was not a philosopher but a tennis player. Arthur Ashe said, ‘One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation’. And it has to be recognised, without doubt, that the Belgian Presidency drew inspiration from this.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the issues I am dealing with here alone, I have seen a great deal of progress: closer cooperation in divorce matters; the European protection order for the victims of violence; future enhanced cooperation for patents, and the agreement on the Late Payment Directive and on the labelling of foodstuffs are all successes that the Belgian Presidency can take pride in.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the common agricultural policy (CAP) after 2013. Though there is as yet no agreement, the principle of a strong CAP with two pillars and the principle of simplification have already been accepted. What agriculture is most in need of in the future, however, is regulation that manages to contain the volatility of the markets within certain limits. Yet there is still no agreement on this and I have grave concerns in respect of future presidencies, notably Hungary and Poland, since regulation does not seem to be one of their priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from good preparation, the full involvement of ministers, the effectiveness of diplomats and of Belgian officers, the secret of the Presidency, which you have emphasised, was not to impose its own agenda but to commit itself to current priority issues, at European level, and to make every effort to move them forward, thanks to the pragmatism and the culture of compromise that characterise us.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that future presidencies will learn from this example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope, therefore, that the question of flexibility and the financing of the ITER fusion energy project will also fall into place soon.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of transport, the Belgian Presidency found a solution to the difficult issue of the Eurovignette. I would particularly like to thank the Belgian Presidency for supporting something that I have been working on for many years, namely, the creation of a network of safe rest areas in Europe so that lorry drivers, who literally hold Europe together and create the internal market, have good and safe conditions in which to work. I would like the governments of all the other countries to be inspired by the Belgian Government’s positive view of this matter so that we can at last get something to happen in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, as we offer our thanks to you, but also to the permanent representation, for your outstanding work and preparation, our pleasure is therefore that much greater. Obviously, your success was not an easy one. The domestic political problems in Belgium have already been mentioned, and Mr Verhofstadt also had to observe that there is not necessarily efficiency at the national level in Belgium or at the European level. Perhaps that is the key to success tomorrow, too – in other words, that the politicians who are competent here need to achieve the necessary recognition in Belgium, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Your success was not easy, as the external conditions, too, were not the best. This was not least because – and I can say this, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in relation to transport – you also did not choose the easiest subjects to deal with. It has been mentioned, and for us it was more than satisfying, that the issue of the Eurovignette, amongst other subjects, was resolved. This issue is not just about a principle. In my view, it is about new funding sources and safe, clean but also efficient mobility at the European level. This is about seeing whether we will be able, tomorrow, to more vigorously readjust this area – mobility – at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who lives in a border area, clearly I am also pleased about the implementation of the road safety provisions. For us, and in every border region, it is unacceptable that it is the licence plate that determines whether or not a serious offence is punished. You have grabbed this awkward subject by the horns and taken a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The passenger rights for bus transport represent an important step with the effect that Europe has now given its citizens passenger rights across all the various forms of transport. During the volcano crisis, we observed how important it is for businesses, but also for passengers, that a European framework of this kind should be in place. I hope that we can continue in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish just one thing for you and for Belgium, and that is that we finally get to see the proficiency at Federal level in Belgium that you have shown at European level following the sound thinking that whoever has to make demands – as you did – must also demonstrate solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How is it possible that I can join in those congratulations, despite the fact that you scarcely mentioned the social dimension and that there is not a great deal of social stocktaking in the Belgian Presidency?</p>
<p class="contents">Quite simply, Mr Leterme, because I have had the privilege of working with your ministers, Mrs Onkelinx and Mrs Milquet, and I am aware of the efforts made by them and their teams to make progress with a social agenda in such difficult circumstances and in a Council that is so insensitive to the social Europe as the one that we unfortunately currently have. Despite this, they have worked valiantly, responsibly and with a highly pro-European spirit to ensure that Parliament is heard and that Europeans are heard at this very serious time when Europe’s future is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore also join in congratulating you, Mr Leterme, and I hope that in future, when the challenges come, what you have said will be true: that Europe will find its soul. That soul needs to be a political and social soul, not just an economic one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a few matters that have not been resolved during your Presidency, on which I hope that you will pass on your pro-European, humanist spirit to the Hungarian Presidency, because a lot is at stake for the future of Europe. I am referring to the matters relating to Europe’s immigration policy, the single permit, the two directives on temporary workers and transfers within a company.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, please tell your colleagues to take a long-term view. There cannot be unequal treatment of workers who come to Europe. There needs to be equal treatment, otherwise we will open up a gap that will have incalculable consequences for the future of the Union. It cannot be that these workers arrive in Europe under unequal conditions with regard to working here, because we will be destroying Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the next six months, the Hungarian Presidency will listen to you and you will be able to regain freedom of speech in the Council, and that the Council will focus on Europe’s soul, which can only be a humanist soul and a soul of progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the impetus given to the interinstitutional dialogue can continue both in the work of the Commission and in the work of the new Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another aspect that we worked on extensively together, which is how to ensure that the economic governance to which you referred can stand on its own two feet, because, if it treats the issue of employment as a balance, it is leading us into disaster. And it worries me to see the way in which the Commission, in the European Semester package, deals with this matter by proposing to Member States that they reduce salaries willy-nilly or increase, virtually blindly, the retirement age and lower the level of pensions.

Despite the fact that the country has not had a government, the Presidency is nevertheless receiving praise from all sides of this Chamber. It is perhaps a depiction of how the EU actually works best – without elected representatives and, in fact, without any people at all. In any case, it was during the Belgian Presidency that the greatest deception so far, the greatest betrayal of European citizens since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, became a reality, namely, the introduction of the now permanent crisis mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">When we had to convince the European people to put the Treaty of Lisbon in place, which entailed the transfer of an unprecedented amount of power to foreigners in Brussels, we were promised that one thing at least could not happen: we would never be responsible for each other’s debts. It was during the Belgian Presidency that this one promise was broken. Now we have, with effect from 2013, an established act to the effect that we are to be responsible for one another’s debts for ever more. That is the legacy of the Belgian Presidency, and it is regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial markets’ return to stability and also economic stability were dominant issues, but it should be said that national egoism went wild, in particular, as regards the budget. The Belgians’ effectiveness in negotiations should be congratulated, but this was, after all, Belgium’s twelfth Presidency. Prime Minister Leterme said that the Presidency’s programme was the Council’s and the Commission’s programme, without the ambition to give it any kind of national priority. We do, however, have to allow future presidencies to decide their own priorities. It seems to me that this is the essence and spirit of integration, about which Prime Minister Leterme was speaking.

Both these presidencies limited their national approach in order to deepen cooperation and coordination in the EU. This good path serves to strengthen a community rather than a government approach. On the other hand, we should be careful in limiting the role of national presidencies in creating their priorities. A specific balance has to function here. An undoubted achievement of the Belgian Presidency is the strengthening of economic governance. Agencies which supervise financial institutions have begun their work. Much has been done towards budget discipline being more rigorously observed. Activities aimed at structural reform have been made the main instrument of development. Furthermore, the impasse over approval of the 2011 EU budget has finally been overcome. We would simply like to say thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feared the opposite. I think one of the reasons the Belgian Presidency is a success is because they took the realities of the Lisbon Treaty into account. Nowadays, there must be a seamless transfer from one Presidency to another. It is like a relay race: the more effective the transfer is – and the more low-profile it is – the better, probably. The Belgians did that exceptionally well and have given an example to other countries of how to do so in future.</p>

Prime Minister, the Belgian Presidency was a good Presidency, because it moved the European project on in a difficult national context, which, nevertheless, did not prevent it from addressing the challenges facing Europe. I have in mind the adoption of the 2011 budget, certain aspects of which leave a bitter taste in our mouths. However, you avoided a detrimental institutional confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the social dimension, from the very outset, the Belgian Presidency was confronted with the over cautiousness of some in the Council. I am thinking in particular of the idea of a framework directive on minimum income. Despite this context, Belgium can be credited with some real progress thanks to the fighting spirit of your ministers and of our ministers: the report of the EPSCO Council before each European Council to act as a necessary counterweight to the ECOFIN Council; the conclusions on social services of general interest; pensions, notably the conference on pensions in Liège, which highlighted the necessary joint consideration of the adequacy and sustainability of pensions, which I feel bound to stress, and the EPSCO declaration on the Year for Combating Poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations once again. Hopefully, this progress will continue with the new presidencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to say that it is very well deserved. With its European spirit, the Belgian Presidency clearly demonstrated impressive efficiency and a very cooperative approach. When the Belgian Presidency took up an issue, we all knew that it would pursue the European goal – and only the European goal – and that it would do so in a spirit of loyal cooperation among the institutions. The Belgian Presidency’s very good cooperation with the European Parliament and very close contacts with the Commission resulted in what is clearly a very impressive list of achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we can say that the Lisbon Treaty is now fully operational. We have managed to give our citizens a new voice through the European Citizens’ Initiative, and we managed to reach an agreement on more transparent and effective rules for comitology. I worked on both of those issues with the Secretary of State, Olivier Chastel, and I must say that I was always impressed by his cooperative spirit and high level of professionalism.</p>
<p class="contents">A calm and constructive approach was needed for the conclusion of the debate on the 2011 Budget, and for the beginning of the new economic governance in Europe. Even in complex, protracted discussions on issues such as divorce, financial supervision and even patents, the Belgian Presidency managed to achieve clear progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very clear now that we need to carry forward the positive spirit and efficiency of the Belgian Presidency. Clearly, the economy, recovering from the crisis and fiscal consolidation remain top priorities for us all. We received good news last week with the successful sale of Portuguese, Spanish and Italian bonds, and we saw reductions in the spreads for Belgium and other countries. But it is also very clear that we need to press ahead with structural reforms and that we have to work even harder. If we do not want to have a jobless recovery, we need to look at how we can reform our labour market rules and how we can remove the obstacles to higher employment in Europe. At the same time, we need to protect the vulnerable in our society and reduce poverty. This is the only way we can develop our social market economy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot will depend on how we start the European Semester and to what extent we will collectively be able to be ambitious in our national reform programmes, in our consolidation efforts, and in implementing the EU 2020 strategy. The Belgian Presidency made a major contribution to the launch of this new process of economic governance and we now have to continue the excellent work it started.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, Secretary of State, I should like to thank you very much for your excellent work. I would also like to thank all your diplomats very much for creating a positive atmosphere in which the next Presidency can continue the work you started so successfully six months ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to see so many people here, but I know that has to do with other items on your agenda. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I, of course, wish to thank all those of you who provided very constructive feedback, which will prove invaluable in your and our work in the future. Let me, first and foremost, say, with regard to the European Parliament’s very positive evaluation of our Presidency, that I try to stick to the principle of being serene in the face of negative feedback and of being very modest in the face of positive feedback, even if it proves to be exaggerated.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to highlight three elements. First of all – and this obviously goes beyond the remit of our Belgian Presidency – I think it is really important that we institute best practice as regards the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Every nation state which takes on the six-month rotating Presidency of the European Union should keep Europe particularly high on its agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the purpose of managing the rotating Presidency is, perhaps not just acting as facilitator, but also as a driving force, as one of you said, so that our institutions can do their work. We all fought hard for the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. It would be absurd, of course, if we managed the rotating Presidency in such a way that it failed to do justice to the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. Moreover, I think that that is the only way in which the rotating Presidency will make sense in the future and any future Treaty amendments or new agreements will survive. Thirdly: not everything is perfect and several members have rightly pointed to some gaps. I would like to reiterate, in particular, that Europe ought to be more ambitious when it comes to social policy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> What has been said is indeed correct. At the level of social policy, the Union must be more ambitious in the future, but I nonetheless believe that Belgium played its part. The Belgian Presidency strengthened the role of employment policies in the Europe 2020 strategy, it ensured that these policies would have a place in the new economic governance of Europe, and I believe that it also created the foundations for the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy, not only the fight against poverty, but also social cohesion. In response to some of the speeches, it seems to me that we have nevertheless put the issue of services of general interest on the European agenda. However, it is true that we need to do more and to move forward, especially at legislative level.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, our Presidency is not perfect and I think that, as Mr Tavares rightly pointed out, we can do more than we are doing today at the level of refugee policy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> By way of conclusion, I will make two final remarks, as there are other items remaining on the agenda. I would emphatically like to address the Belgian members of the European Parliament in general, but several of them in particular, especially two of my predecessors.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Belgian Government, I would like to say that we consider the efforts we put in during the Belgian Presidency as a kind of salute to your work here. We have done all that we could, ladies and gentlemen, to apply the Treaty of Lisbon correctly, which is also a kind of salute to the initiatives developed since the eleventh Presidency, which oversaw the emergence of the Treaty of Laeken, and later, under important rapporteurships, with a view to implementing the spirit of Laeken in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">It has rightly been pointed out that a rotating Presidency primarily relies on the commitment and achievement of a great many people around the politicians who have to take responsibility and stand in the firing line. I am talking about the advisers, the diplomats, about a great many people who are ultimately the ones doing the most important work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to let Mr Staes know that, while the Golden Shoe Prize, which will be awarded in Belgium tomorrow, has always gone to people like Lukaku and Boussoufa, if it was the Belgian Presidency which was being honoured, the Golden Shoe would easily go to its diplomatic service, some of whose staff are seated here behind me.</p>

That was all we could have expected from a Belgian Government that has not actually existed for eight months. Belgian politics has not managed to set out a political plan for its own country, which is the victim of an unprecedented institutional crisis. I do not see how it could possibly have led such a complex entity as the European Union – itself very fragile and rickety today – with foresight and vision for the future. The Belgian Presidency was supposed to put Europe on the road to recovery from the economic and financial crisis. Yet, once again, we find ourselves tackling the speculation that threatens the very existence of the single currency, even today. It was the Belgian Presidency that was behind the major acceleration in the further enlargement of the EU’s borders. As we have seen in recent years, the accession of economically weak countries has complicated the work of the European institutions and weakened the whole of Europe, which is now less capable than it was previously of shouldering the domestic problems of any new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country was mainly preoccupied – and what is more, unsuccessfully so – with forming a new government, while the quarrelling between the Flemings and the Walloons has rendered the country unable to make political decisions. It was therefore little wonder that the EU political establishment had an easy ride in its desire to push forward centralisation within the European Union. The euro crisis was used as a pretext to forge plans for European economic governance. Meanwhile, the so-called ‘permanent rescue package’ for the euro is nothing other than an assault on the net contributors, who will have to dig even deeper into their pockets in future. Belgium should actually be regarded as a cautionary example of what can happen if peoples with differing economic performances are corseted up together. Belgium, where the differences between the Flemings and the Walloons are evidently irreconcilable, and where the Federal apparatus represents a redistribution mechanism from the Flemings to the Walloons, shows what may befall the European Union and the euro area if they continue to follow the existing misguided path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of those who observed that process know that it is a difficult operation and was carried out under time pressure. For this reason, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to all of those who contributed to bringing the project to fruition. In this regard, the Belgian Presidency has left behind for the Hungarian Presidency a job well done. It should also be stressed that the Belgians have marked out the path for future presidencies in the context of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. I would like to express the hope that future presidencies, including the Polish one, will try to set their own, clear priorities to a greater extent, while still placing them, however, within our common, European objectives. This method of working allows the policies of European institutions to be planned and carried out to a greater extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Belgian team can be considered all the more successful in view of the circumstances in which the country took over the Presidency. Firstly, this was the first Presidency which had operated on the basis of the rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and secondly, the EU and its individual Member States were in an extremely difficult financial position. In addition, Belgium had to deal with domestic problems during its Presidency. In spite of it being such a difficult and demanding time, the Presidency showed how effective it could be, displaying true European style in the implementation of all measures. It left its domestic problems and issues to one side and concentrated on following a course of action that corresponded to the proposals of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, and on supporting these institutions. The Presidency took on the role of a mediator. With regard to the priorities achieved by the Presidency, measures focused on combating the economic crisis deserve recognition; I am thinking here, above all, of work on the next multiannual financial framework. The Eurovignette is a further significant achievement of the Belgian Presidency. Finally, I would like to say that the Belgian Presidency can serve as a good lesson for the next countries taking over the Presidency of the European Council. I would like to wish both the Hungarian Presidency and the Polish Presidency, which will begin in the second half of 2011, the same success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its work, which has just come to an end, can serve as a model for the countries which will lead the work of the European Council in future. This is a subject particularly close to my heart in view of Poland’s upcoming Presidency, which I hope will follow all the trails blazed so successfully under the Belgian Presidency. It is not often the case that the country holding the Presidency puts Community measures before domestic interests. In my opinion, the key success of the Presidency we are discussing was its consistent implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, at the level of the European Council, which became a full institution with a permanent President, and at the level of the Foreign Affairs Council, which is currently headed by the High Representative. Combating the economic crisis also proved to be a matter of no little significance, and the systematic monitoring and moderation of the financial sector will make it possible, over time, to restore its tarnished reputation. This is particularly important at a time when there is so much pressure to extend the euro area. To sum up, I sincerely hope that the path mapped out during the Belgian Presidency will serve as a quality standard for the countries taking over future presidencies. May the good of the Community always be our priority. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We simply had to tackle the problems faced by 12 million citizens directly employed in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stihler report is a valuable tool for bringing down the national administrative and technical barriers that prevent the marketing of construction products within the European Union and for continuing to build a single market in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the recognition given to small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector, just as I support the particular attention paid to the need to recycle construction products, which is an issue of the utmost importance in the fight against climate change. However, I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the issue of the health and safety of workers employed in the construction sector. The guidelines that the rapporteur has included on this matter are useful, but they need to be expanded upon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to discuss and develop these proposals further in the immediate future, thereby ensuring that workers employed in the construction sector receive a high level of protection. The tragedy of work-related deaths is an issue that concerns the whole of Europe. I hope that, through our work, we will be able to put a stop to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important to focus attention on the harmonisation of the marketing of construction products, because in the future, we will need better and higher quality construction.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to remember that, although this is a highly competitive industry, what is most important is not the competition in itself, but the end result. It is important that the buildings which are constructed in Europe are safe for their users and that they are also safe for the builders and other employees during the construction process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we also have harmonisation in the area of the marketing of construction products, and, as a result, are able to exchange best practices. It is true that in many countries in Europe at present, they still use materials which are not healthy for residents. For example, we have a huge problem with mildew in many Member States of the European Union, and that is why it is important to use best practices and innovations to try to make the marketing of construction products one that relates to products that are healthy and satisfactory as far as their users are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to thank Mrs Stihler for this excellent report. Europe needs good construction products and a system of marketing that takes account of the safety regulations specifically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Consensus on humanitarian aid, signed on 18 December by the Presidents of the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Commission, represents a significant step forward. I must point out here that the commitments derived from the Consensus apply both to the Member States and to the European Commission.</p>

The agricultural sector must meet a growing population’s need for safe and sufficient food despite the obstacles of limited natural resources, high energy prices and climate change. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, food production must increase by at least 70% to meet the growing demands of a world population which is expected to exceed 9 billion by the year 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, around 900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty, while up to 2 billion people lack genuine long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty. In Europe, 16% of citizens still live below the poverty line. Basically, what I am saying is this: we need to tackle this issue head-on. It is essential that the financing of the new common agricultural policy after 2013 recognises this, and the very least we need is that the budget should be maintained at least at its current level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have recognised for many years. Likewise, we also recognise the fact that agriculture is a strategic sector when it comes to food quality, public health and sustainable, economic growth. However, this does not justify school fruit and milk programmes. Nor does it justify more market-supported milk subsidy programmes. We would like to point out that we voted against these proposals and we regret the fact that they were voted through.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this must not destroy the overall picture, which is the fact that we must provide good conditions for agriculture. Butter mountains, wine lakes and school programmes are not the way forward, however. Farmers’ income will not be secured by intervention and distortion of the market. Instead, we must invest in research and give farmers the opportunity to use new technologies for alternative forms of income. Overall, we consider the report to be good, and therefore we voted in favour of it as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This should not be the case. Our farmers should be supported to produce food in a way which is not harmful to the environment, and as for importing food, world markets are simply too volatile – both in terms of price and in terms of consistency of supply.</p>

One such challenge is climate change, which unfortunately may cause unpredictable food shortages, and thus endanger the satisfaction of the growing demand of the world’s population, estimated to reach more than 9 billion by 2050. The common agricultural policy must react unequivocally to challenges posed by food safety, climate change and economic crisis. Not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale and organic farming, and local values must be encouraged. As a result of climate changes, there are more and more natural disasters, which will have the effect of reducing the possibility of using large areas of agricultural land, thus jeopardising food safety. To achieve the above objectives, and in the interest of rational food prices and a fair income for agricultural producers, the CAP budget must be maintained at least at its current level. For this reason, it is important to handle agriculture as a strategic sector from the point of view of food safety. This is why I, too, supported this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important for us to ensure that the food that we produce in the European Union is, above all, safe and free from impurities. I am rather worried that we tend to pay more attention to quantity than quality. The insistence on efficiency has somehow overlooked these health requirements. When we talk about food security, it is very important to ensure that the food which is made available to European consumers is safe, good quality and nutritious.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucially important to ensure that the various Member States of the European Union preserve their own agricultural practices. When we face natural disasters, it is important that we have a farming economy that is self­sufficient. In this way, we can use the principle of the sourcing of local food to respond to the issues that may arise when disaster strikes.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress, above all, the importance of these principles, which derive from considerations of health and are important. I hope that we will see more of this trend in local food. It is important all over Europe to ensure that agriculture is absolutely viable and that every Member State of the European Union is able to practise farming. It is vital and a strong basis for the future, which we need specifically in the food sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the recent serious events in Germany demonstrate, national food safety bodies need to be set up today by all the Member States. It is surprising that the Italian Government, after establishing the Agency, has changed its mind for budgetary reasons.

This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, and considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. The codification of legislation is particularly important in the field of business, which, in order to ensure the smooth and continuous free movement of people, goods and services, is regulated by a significant amount of Community legislation. The consolidation of legislation regulating mergers of public limited liability companies is a welcome step towards improving Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, since 1978, European legislation has been in place to regulate mergers of public limited liability companies from the same Member State. It is important to regulate these mergers because they may significantly affect the interests of the employees, shareholders and creditors of those companies. They may be adversely affected, for example, if the merger is subsequently cancelled. On this European matter as on others, we need clarity and legal certainty.

However, there is no need for an analysis of the draft terms of merger to be carried out by an independent expert. Furthermore, the administrative or management bodies of each of the companies involved inform the general meeting of their respective companies and the administrative or management bodies of the other companies involved of any material change which has occurred between the date of preparation of the draft terms of merger and the date of the general meetings which are to decide on the draft terms of merger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, the study, carried out by a respected Italian university on behalf of the country’s most active business association, claims that mergers were the main means of consolidation. It is not by chance that major financial operations, including mergers, go hand in hand with restructuring and the search for efficiencies in all economic sectors. Within the single market, it is therefore incumbent upon the European institutions to lay down rules that can provide guarantees for all those involved and enable more virtuous businesses to compete better, free from legal uncertainties, red tape and obligations caused by simple misunderstandings. A modern, liberal and efficient economy – as I believe ours must be – needs a specific law on mergers but only if, like the directive proposed today, it is streamlined and non-interfering, and protects the freedoms and rights of the people who could be hurt by these operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union that avoids discrimination between EU air carriers, allows the taxation of aircraft fuel for operations within the territory of the European Union, and brings into line with EU competition law provisions in bilateral agreements which are clearly anti-competitive, namely, obligatory commercial agreements between airlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution voted on is about specific issues of this nature and aims to harmonise the international law instruments currently in force, as well as to adapt them to the additional requirements arising from EU law. The subject in question is highly technical, involving the replacing of agreements that were previously in force with others, without involving anything contentious or any significant changes in ideology. The fact that the vote in committee was unanimously in favour confirms this interpretation. All that was needed in plenary, therefore, was to ratify a consensual decision.

Until now, in this area which is strategic in terms of safeguarding national interests for a number of reasons, the Member States made sovereign decisions about how agreements – which have a clear impact on airlines – should be organised and what their scope should be. Nevertheless, the intention is that, from now on, the market will be king here too. In particular, we cannot underestimate the contribution that the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies could make towards facilitating the monopolistic concentration of the sector – which is already under way – and the reduction of the Member States’ capacity to defend their flag-carrying airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The ubiquitous and sacrosanct ‘free competition’ is defended at all costs and is once again the pillar by which this initiative is supported. The consequences for this sector are not substantially different from those for others: it is the monopolistic concentration that always ends up being imposed in these cases. For these reasons, we did not vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the weight of the rulings of the Court of Justice on the Community’s exclusive competence behind me, I must say that I am very much in favour of the renegotiation of these agreements, both because they go against the increasing importance of European sovereignty and because this draft decision is in line with EU competition and budget law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the Council authorised the Commission in June 2003 to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements. Thus, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union that replaces certain provisions in the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is entitled to give its consent to the conclusion of this agreement in accordance with Rule 81 of the Rules of Procedure. Parliament shall take a decision by means of a single vote, and no amendments to the agreement itself may be tabled. On the basis of the above, the rapporteur suggested that the Committee on Transport and Tourism, first, and then Parliament as a whole, should give a favourable opinion on the conclusion of this agreement.

In the EU, there are still barriers to trade in the construction sector, because Member States still use national technical rules to prevent the free movement of goods and services in the construction sector. The review of the Construction Products Directive in this context is a much needed boost which should help the sector by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers and thereby helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment.

The construction market continues to face a whole range of obstacles preventing the full development of a unified market. The aim of the submitted regulation is to amend the existing directive and thereby to simplify the conditions for marketing construction products. It mainly involves market supervision and a common framework for the marketing of construction products. The aim of the amendment to the directive is, in a period of economic downturn, to assist the construction sector in eliminating commercial obstacles, thereby preserving jobs and sustaining a great many construction firms that would otherwise not survive the economic downturn. The Council, in its position in the first reading, removed the amendment proposals of Parliament, which aimed at establishing a duty to declare the hazardous materials contained in construction products (for example, asbestos). I consider this very dangerous, and I therefore support the submitted report, as it again proposes an obligation on construction firms to declare the hazardous materials contained in construction products. We must protect the health of our citizens. Last but not least, I would like to applaud the effort to ensure that Member States secure the independence of representatives on the Standing Committee on Construction, which assesses and verifies the properties of construction products. Among other things, the report also includes amendment proposals for increasing health and safety protection, not only for construction workers, but also for actual users of buildings.

Preventing the risk of non-conformity is a necessity so as to avoid placing on the market products intended for sale which do not fulfil the requirements of this regulation, thereby guaranteeing that construction products perform properly and that the basic requirements applicable to construction works are met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to increase awareness of new and existing construction products, so-called contact points should be established, which must be impartial, in other words, independent in financial and personnel terms of bodies connected with the process of obtaining CE marks.

The Commission is right in its initiative to facilitate the practical implementation of the existing directive and make that implementation process more efficient. Construction products clearly differ from other products whose movement within the internal market is controlled by directives. Whereas the safety requirements for a product are generally standardised across directives, construction products are intermediate products, intended for building projects, and, thanks to this special feature, the aims of the directive on construction products will be achieved by successfully determining harmonised approaches to ensuring that the declaration of performance for a product is precise and reliable. In this respect, the new regulation will mean a major improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to take into account the different circumstances prevailing around Europe in order to ensure the survival of micro­enterprises operating locally. Member States naturally set differing requirements for construction works, owing to climatic conditions. It is nevertheless important to focus attention on pointless test requirements and eliminate them, so that we can reduce the administrative burden. I believe that this regulation will improve both the functioning of the internal market and the standardisation process for construction products in Europe. For this reason, I voted in favour of the regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The construction industry has been particularly affected by the current economic situation, and the proposed regulation is intended to promote the free, effective and transparent movement of goods and services to the construction industry. The removal of obstacles to cross-border activity and the elimination of national administrative and technical barriers have a crucial role in the construction industry.

Given that the construction sector represents 10% of gross domestic product in the EU and is currently experiencing a period of severe recession, all measures that can be taken to help boost construction are welcome and will have my vote.

The economic downturn has hit the EU construction industry hard, with many workers losing their jobs. This led to a drop of up to 14.2% in the sector’s activity between 2008 and 2009. The review of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC) in this context offers a measure of support for the construction sector by removing the trade barriers facing manufacturers, thereby helping companies to stay in business and workers to remain in employment. Construction works, both as a whole and in their separate parts, must be fit for their intended use, taking into account, in particular, the health and safety of those involved throughout the life cycle of the works. Construction works must also be energy efficient, using as little energy as possible during their life cycle and, therefore, at the lowest cost to users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the second quarter of 2010, the Lithuanian construction sector shrank by up to 42.9%, one of the steepest declines in Europe. Since then, the situation has improved slightly, but let us be under no illusions – the Lithuanian construction sector is taking a long time to recover. Therefore, it is rather premature to talk of a steady recovery. There is still room for improvement. For instance, my country’s construction sector would recover more quickly if the take-up of EU aid was improved. The construction sector is one of the biggest branches of Lithuanian and European industry. The sector employs 12 million EU citizens directly, with 26 million workers dependent on the sector. The construction sector is very important for Lithuania because it creates a lot of jobs, strengthens internal demand and brings money into the budget. This sector is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises, the cornerstone of our economy. Approximately 92% of companies manufacturing construction materials are SMEs with fewer than 250 employees. I also agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to use e-communication and IT methods to improve the single market in construction products. This is important as we look to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My vote in favour of the Construction Products Regulation reflects the need for a modernised, safe and transparent directive on construction products. The proposal calls for improvements to health and safety procedures across the sector and clear declarations of hazardous substances. Furthermore, the provision of a ‘CE’ mark of confidence on products will give those conducting their own projects the confidence that the materials they are using are safe. The European economy is based heavily on the construction sector, which accounts for 10% of EU GDP and directly employs 12 million EU citizens. Most of those employed find themselves in SMEs, which form a vital part of the European economy. However, construction remains one of the most dangerous areas of work. I thus support this regulation to improve the safety of European citizens in their places of work and at home, whether they be carrying out projects independently or professionally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Initially, because it insists on linking civil protection and humanitarian aid with the European External Action Service and its foreign policy, whereas, obviously, intervention criteria should be clearly humanitarian and humanitarian alone. Also, because I do not believe that linking civil and military capabilities in order to deal with humanitarian crisis situations is a move in the right direction. Obviously, particular knowledge and the use of special equipment, which has always been owned and used by the military, are needed in certain circumstances. Therefore, in order to preserve and safeguard the purely civil character of humanitarian missions, civil protection could be financed so that it has such specific equipment and, of course, so that civil protection workers can be trained, rather than keeping up all this military spending. It is the only way to provide real and effective help in humanitarian crises without facing the dangers of a military presence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, instead of finding fault, we must promote and set out the path that we should be following as regards humanitarian aid. The humanitarian situation has changed a fair amount in recent years, with natural disasters, more displaced persons, the multiplication of various internal conflicts, food crises, etc. More than ever, there is an urgent need for a balanced and effective global reaction that is based on specific needs, is results-oriented, and is guided by the principle that saving means of subsistence is saving lives, whilst considering the involved areas’ need for self-development and self-sufficiency. To achieve this, it is crucial for the Consensus to promote these humanitarian values, and for various players to optimise resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would argue that there is an urgent need to create a European Civil Protection Force following the Barnier report of May 2006. I would congratulate my colleague, Mrs Striffler, on the positive content of the proposals she has tabled, and I would reiterate my position that the Consensus is an essential instrument, with every relevance to the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this juncture, I would like to congratulate Mrs Striffler on the excellent work that she has done. As regards the ideas expressed in the report, I would like to highlight the emphasis on ‘genuine and continuous… participation… of beneficiaries in the management of aid’. I have been advocating this principle, which should lead the EU to focus its action increasingly on civil society and local authorities. This will reduce the focus on EU-Member State relations, which should continue to play a role, but not in an exclusive relationship, as it has often manifested itself up until now. I would also like to highlight the need to submit proposals aimed at ‘the establishment of a European civil protection force, based on optimising the existing Community Civil Protection Mechanism and pooling existing national resources,’ which would mean an increase in the marginal cost for synergies achieved, through the capacity that has already been established in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Differing rates of development and growing inequality in opportunity and resource distribution in geographical, social and generational terms, increasing climate change (for which humans are partly to blame) and the associated increase in natural disasters, increased environmental pollution, imbalanced anthropic pressure concentrated in large urban areas, and uneven population growth in some areas of the planet, have led to a rising number of humanitarian disasters in which aid takes on an essential role in restoring basic living conditions and human dignity. In view of this, if humanitarian aid is needed to assist people hit by disasters, then in turn, any interventions as a result of EU foreign policy – which is still to be defined – cannot be apportioned according to each Member State’s areas of interest and influence, but should take on a European dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable. The European Union is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. Its contribution represents more than 40% of all official international humanitarian assistance. In 2009, we provided a total of EUR 950 million to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries. The European Consensus on humanitarian aid, signed on 18 December 2007, underscores the will of the EU to cooperate closely in this field in order to be as effective as possible, to defend and promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and actively to advocate the observance of international humanitarian law. There are many challenges ahead. The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again that the EU’s disaster-response capability needs to be greatly enhanced. Disaster risk reduction needs to be fully integrated into policies for development aid and humanitarian aid. We also need clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the consensus and the UN guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it is a matter of great importance, it does not fall within the scope of this discussion to address the impact of climate change on these disasters. The signing of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid by the Council of the European Union, Parliament and the Commission on 18 December 2007 represented a significant step forward in terms of humanitarian aid, especially as an action plan was envisaged for five years, providing for a mid-term review. That is the objective of this report. The whole world knows and recognises the key role of the EU in humanitarian aid. Parliament has tackled this issue at several sittings, particularly through our speeches. Indeed, recent events in Brazil, Haiti, Pakistan, Madeira and other places cause us to ponder the effectiveness of support for civil protection and humanitarian aid. As was demonstrated in this report, in spite of the limited information available, there are positive developments at a European level, as evidenced by the creation of the Council’s Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid.

It frequently makes use of genuine needs for aid and cooperation to which it is important to respond, particularly emergencies, whilst a great variety of objectives are being pursued in practice. The actions taken and the methods used, which include military intervention and occupation, seek to reproduce and deepen forms of political and economic domination, and to attempt to control the markets and natural resources of developing countries.

In this changing context, the first factor to highlight is the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters caused, particularly, by the impact of climate change. This implies a need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and to provide support – in addition to one-off aid – for communities’ own disaster-preparedness capabilities. Further factors are the increasing incidence of complex crises, especially internal conflicts, and the changing nature of conflicts, many of which entail the displacement of huge numbers of people (refugees and internally displaced persons), as well as increased violence against civilians. Violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common and the situation in the field is deteriorating. One particularly shocking aspect of such violations is the increasing use of sexual violence as a weapon of war. Major efforts ought to be focused on incorporating protection against sexual violence into humanitarian responses. Therefore, more specific attention should be directed at the most vulnerable groups of people, including women, children and people who have been forcibly displaced (whether internally or as refugees). The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU’s disaster-response capability in terms of effectiveness, coordination and visibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential for the EU to learn from the experience of providing effective aid after previous disasters, for example, in Australia, Haiti and Russia, in order to have completely clear procedures and resources for providing effective humanitarian aid. The continent of Europe has so far avoided disasters on such a scale, but this does not mean that we should not prepare an effective range of structures and resources. Experience from recent years shows that securing transport into affected areas is not possible without technical and organisational support from military units. Non-governmental humanitarian organisations do not have these capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that the inhabitants of affected areas very often remain cut off in terms of transport links around the country, and the capacity of civil aviation resources is limited.

Nevertheless, I believe that in addition to helping the most disadvantaged and all those who are affected by these disasters, it is also necessary to provide the poorest countries, and therefore those that are most vulnerable to this type of situation, with human resources and funding so that external aid is not so critical.

<p class="contents">With these considerations in mind, I agree with the rapporteur when she calls for a substantial increase in funding for humanitarian aid and when she observes that the Consensus on humanitarian aid is not sufficiently known.

This aside, it would appear that there is still a lack of awareness of the Consensus. We therefore need to make a greater effort to bolster its visibility. I believe that, in a sector as fragile as humanitarian aid, it is important to be aware of how circumstances have changed over the years, bearing in mind the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters. As a result, I think we need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and provide support for communities’ own capabilities in this regard.

Thus, when Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid is revised under the codecision procedure, it will have its own legal basis. The Lisbon Treaty also provided for the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS).

The last few decades have certainly seen something of a fall in this area for the benefit of other important areas, but we must not lose sight of the fact that Europe’s agricultural independence is a major strategic challenge. As the Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Joseph Daul, moreover emphasised at the beginning of this new year, food security will be the major issue in 2011. Indeed, world food shortages and the resulting crises must alert us to the seriousness of the situation: a sharp rise in prices and a scarce supply of essential resources. Europe must respond to this new challenge. Environmental issues add to the complexity and scale of the problem. That is why I voted in favour of this resolution, which seeks to ensure that the strategic nature of the issue is recognised. It points out the role that the Union can play in the management of global stocks and the suitability of the CAP with respect to these challenges, and draws attention to the harmful impact of speculation on commodity prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the rapid growth in the world’s population, the agricultural sector must meet a growing need for safe and sufficient food, despite the obstacles of limited natural resources, high energy prices and climate change. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), food production must increase by at least 70 percent to meet the growing demands of a world population, which is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050. Furthermore, around 900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty, while up to 2 billion people lack genuine, long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty. Therefore, the accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with. I agree that the new CAP to be put in place after 2013 needs to promote not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution, in order to contribute to food security.

Leave that to Member States, if they so desire. Moreover, I have also voted against the paragraph relating to the liberalisation and promotion of GMO imports.

It is important that the objectives and instruments identified by this policy endeavour to meet as fully as possible the need to integrate a specific national dimension into the common agricultural policy’s structure.

Food security can be achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient food that is safe and meets their dietary needs. Food security requires a robust common agricultural policy, but it needs to be consistent and address social concerns. It must be consistent in the sense that it does not allow surpluses in production which distort the market and cause environmental problems, and it must be socially engaged by ensuring that all people from all social backgrounds have access to quality food.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I welcome the way that the issue of diversity in European agriculture is being addressed: competitiveness and innovation can, and should, go hand in hand with traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution.

In other words, I see it as an inalienable part of our sovereignty as a union of peoples and countries. In saying this, I wish to assert that the right to food security, besides being a basic human right, should be guaranteed by our internal production. A common agricultural policy (CAP) is thus essential in order to ensure this objective. I would therefore like to say again that the fundamental objective of the CAP should be to maintain the competitiveness of European agriculture and support for farming in the EU, so as to ensure food production, principally at local level, and balanced territorial development. I also believe fair returns should be ensured in the agricultural sector, as it is only possible to stimulate productive systems that are sustainable and ethical if farmers are duly compensated for the investments and commitments that they make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Defining its output as a primary sector in economic terms relates not only to the historical trend of its development, but also, and above all, to its role in stabilising societies and their economies. Balanced agricultural production has to be attentive not only to the quantities produced, but also, and primarily, to the quality of the output, so that it assists in the healthy development of the population. From this perspective, therefore, food security plays a key role, and its protection – particularly in terms of traditional and local produce – increases the opportunities for development throughout the territory. The positive correlation between food security and the quality and healthiness of agricultural products also involves increasing their eco-friendliness, while particular care must be paid to the domino effect caused by the uncontrolled introduction of genetically modified organisms, in order to provide, in the first instance, the necessary certainties as regards the medium- and long-term effects that these products could have on health and local economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With one major challenge: to be able to respond to the doubling of demand for food production and supply that will take place between now and 2050, in a context marked by scarcity of water, by a reduction in arable land and by a new energy situation dictated by the fight against climate change. The global organisation of agricultural markets needs to be rethought, taking into account the two main inspirations of the common agricultural policy: guaranteeing food security and saving the lifeblood of small farmers and their families, both at home and in the world’s poorest countries. This also hinges on the creation of a targeted global system of food stocks, consisting of emergency stocks to reduce hunger and stocks to be used to regulate commodity prices.

Besides the need for the agricultural sector to provide a secure supply of food, it is also vital that this should be sufficient. For this reason, we cannot forget the recommendations of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation on the urgency of an increase in food production of at least 70% to feed a world population which is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. I am glad that this resolution has been adopted, as it acknowledges the role of the European Food Safety Authority as the body responsible for monitoring and reporting risks inherent to the food chain, and encourages the Member States to establish bodies to cooperate with it. I would also like to highlight the recognition given to traditional agriculture, particularly organic and small-scale farming, which exists in the more disadvantaged regions, and which represents not only an economic asset but, above all, an environmental asset, as it is essential for preserving biodiversity. I hope that the new common agricultural policy will respond efficiently to the problems facing this sector: climate change, keeping consumer prices steady and guaranteeing incomes for farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the approach to each of these problems, as to all other problems relating to food security, is very incomplete, at times contradictory and, in some cases, wrong. The consequences of current agricultural policies – specifically the common agricultural policy and successive reforms of it – are omitted, as are the liberalisation of the markets and dismantling of regulatory instruments, and the resulting ruin of thousands of small and medium-sized producers, faced with prices for their products that often do not cover the costs of production.</p>
<p class="contents">It is increasingly being argued that ‘we will need to make use of all forms of farming in order to be able to feed Europe and third countries’: this is an implicit argument for unsustainable production models that produce intensively and for export, as well as for genetically modified crops; the report also calls for the process of approving the importation of these genetically modified crops to be streamlined and made faster. Finally, the rapporteur ‘welcomes the Commission proposal for a regulation on [over-the-counter] derivatives’, which is a proposal that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food condemns for failing to prevent speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this point in time, when we are preparing to reform the common agricultural policy after 2013, today’s vote shows the direction that Parliament is intending to take. In order to ensure a secure supply of affordable food, the EU must equip itself with a strong common agricultural policy (CAP) that discourages speculation on food commodities and helps young people to enter the farming sector. I think it is important to emphasise that the future CAP must also provide citizens with access to an adequate supply of food, allow for the dissemination of nutritional information and create better conditions for the implementation of programmes such as school milk and fruit schemes. Furthermore, today’s vote instructs the Commission to work out how to implement a ‘targeted global system of food stocks’ with emergency stocks to reduce hunger and other stocks to be used to regulate commodity prices. Particular attention also needs to be paid to the issue of genetically modified organisms.

A large number of people worldwide are chronically hungry or lack genuine, long-term food security. In spite of apparent sufficiency of supplies, a significant proportion of the world’s population cannot afford the basic food it needs, and accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with urgently. It is important to be sure that food is accessible to all social categories of people. Food security as an objective cannot be reached without tackling two of the most important questions of the day: market and price volatility (strongly influenced by speculation on commodities markets) and dwindling food stocks. Under no circumstances must we allow food price speculation. We must promote not only competitiveness, but also traditional agriculture, small-scale farming, organic farming and local distribution, ensuring agricultural diversity throughout Europe. Furthermore, in the context of an ageing rural population, I believe it is very important to guarantee access to land and credit for young farmers. Our objective is to maintain reasonable food prices and a decent income for farmers. However, under no circumstances will I approve of the use of genetically modified materials, their import to consumers and other activities, or the authorisation of production methods brought to bear in third countries, because there is no data that would lead us to reasonably believe that these do not harm people’s health or the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not, as yet, proved possible to bring a halt to the worrying trend of farmers moving away from full-time farming and towards farming as a sideline business and of farmers leaving the land. If we are discussing food security, then, we need to come up with plans for how this worrying trend can be halted and also for how to increase consumers’ awareness of regional products. In particular, there is a need, in this context, to scrutinise EU subsidies with regard to how the transport of foodstuffs criss-crossing the Union can be reduced. This is not only for the benefit of the environment, in which regard it helps to implement the Kyoto targets on reducing emissions, but it also reduces noise pollution, especially for those people who live or work along the transit routes.</p>

However, its success resulted in unintended overproduction and surpluses which distorted the market and raised environmental concerns. The new CAP should therefore improve food security by increasing productivity, whilst simultaneously encouraging environmentally sustainable food production. The report stresses that it is essential for the financing of the CAP to reflect its ambitious vision and policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">To maintain reasonable food prices and, above all, a decent income for farmers, and to ensure food security, the CAP should be maintained at the current level.

According to the FAO, global food demand will double by 2050, and the number of people in the world will grow from the present 7 billion to 9 billion. Global food production will therefore have to increase correspondingly, against a backdrop of pressure on natural resources. Global food production will have to grow at the same time as water, energy, fertiliser, pesticide and land use is reduced. It is alarming to learn that there are a total of over 1 billion people starving, while in the European Union, over 40 million people living in poverty go hungry. For this reason, too, I believe that scientific progress should be exploited if it can provide appropriate solutions aimed at alleviating hunger throughout the world, particularly by means of a more effective use of resources. The EU must continue to guarantee food security for its citizens and participate in supplying food to the entire world, whereby cooperation with the rest of the world, in particular, with developing countries, must be closer and more coherent in order to help them with the long-term sustainable development of agricultural sectors.

Above all, every effort must be made, through financial inducements, to promote traditional, small-scale or organic farming, in order to ensure continuous food security.

The financial crisis and increasingly severe weather phenomena such as those that occurred in 2010, with the prolonged drought and fires in Russia and the major floods in Pakistan, have contributed to enormous instability. The EU cannot remain dependent on the protectionist decisions by countries such as Russia and Ukraine, which export about 30% of the world’s wheat, or Argentina, a large global producer of meat. I believe that the EU has a duty to feed the European public and the world’s population, which is expected to increase by 2 billion and therefore necessitate a 70% increase in the food supplied by the year 2050. Increased production should meet criteria relating to the environment, food security, animal welfare and labour. Distribution has been shifted to the least developed countries, but these do not appear to have the capacity to meet these criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, production will have to increase by 70% by 2050, since around 900 million people worldwide suffer from hunger, and in Europe alone, 16% of the population live below the poverty line. A strong common agricultural policy (CAP) is essential and indeed the CAP follows this line, but it needs a reform that will make it sustainable and improve food security. This objective can only be achieved by resolving the issue of price volatility (caused by speculation) and dwindling food stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the report supports the need to revise the existing legislation on financial instruments and the creation of a global system of food stocks to ease world trade when price spikes and instances of protectionism occur. The new CAP after 2013 must be prepared for all of this, and that is why I am backing this report, which promotes competitiveness, traditional agriculture, access to land and credit for young farmers, and improved integration of food and energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission must come up with tough and lasting measures to address volatility in the agricultural markets. That is crucial to maintaining production in the EU.

European citizens are making ever more demands in relation to food security, which must be guaranteed along the whole production, processing and distribution chain. The challenges to be addressed in order to ensure sustainable, secure and fair agriculture are many: adapting to climate change, controlling the effects of globalisation, preserving biodiversity, maintaining farmers’ standard of living and guaranteeing our food self-sufficiency in a global market subject to strong pressure. Agriculture is an integral part of our heritage and has always shaped our identity, way of life and landscapes. I welcome the EU’s efforts in relation to agriculture, but important work still needs to be carried out in connection with the reform of the CAP. I therefore call on the EU to concentrate its efforts on small farmers, who are the largest but, above all, the most vulnerable group.

There can be no doubt that food aid programmes should be put in place for the poorest members of society. We often forget that nearly 80 million people in the European Union live below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as aid programmes, we should develop programmes promoting healthy eating, above all, for children and secondary school pupils. The consequences of neglecting such matters can be seen very clearly in the US, where the number of obese teenagers has tripled in recent years. It is particularly important for programmes promoting the consumption of fruit and milk to be implemented in educational institutions, since learning the right eating habits will have a positive impact on the health of young Europeans, thus reducing health and social spending in the future. The greatest possible number of local food producers and distributors should be involved in the implementation of programmes of this kind, since this will strengthen the position of small and medium-sized agricultural holdings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title15"></a><a name="creitem15"></a>

<p class="contents">In fact, this is not just my position but the unanimous position of the Commission. It says in this document, about the annual growth survey, that the Commission considers that the effective financing capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) must be reinforced and the scope of its activity widened. We consider this as part of a comprehensive response and not, of course, as the entire response. There is only one sentence in this document about the EFSF. It is also about structural reform, fiscal consolidation and growth-enhancing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">But, in fact, it is important for the stability of the euro area to increase lending capacity because, as you know, the EFSF is currently endowed with EUR 440 billion. I am not asking now for this ceiling to be increased, but we know that the EFSF cannot, de facto, lend this EUR 440 billion if need be, due to the need to secure a triple-A rating for the EFSF. So the minimum we can and should do is to increase the capacity of the fund. I think this is a very constructive proposal that should be adopted sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means there is a chance, if this continues, that events similar to the arrest of Mr Nemtsov could happen in 2011. So what joint action can the EU institutions take on this matter?

My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all. I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this. The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime. Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel. It is an important political issue.

In both cases, we need to consider how we can make these two variants compatible with each other in the long term. The issues here are the environment and power generation. It is my belief that approval procedures in this area should not take longer than a year. The Commission has currently proposed a period of five years.

I would therefore ask that all the Directorates General of your Commission jointly adopt a more holistic approach. For example, there are, in fact, innovation partnerships currently under way which fall mainly within the remit of a single directorate general. However, the approach needs to be more holistic. I also think that the funds should be merged to a greater extent and that we should prevent fragmentation. Ideally, we should have a single fund, which ought to include structural funds, as well. I ask you to really look into this and create, in cooperation with Member States, a single, powerful momentum for innovation.</p>

Our priority in terms of infrastructure is to establish interconnections, because that has a critical European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to make proposals on that matter to the European Council. Something has been achieved already – for instance BEMIP, the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan, for the Baltic countries. Now we are working also with Central and Eastern European countries to establish, if possible, North-South interconnections, and things are going well. I have just been to Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in connection with work on the Southern Gas Corridor, a new potential means of bringing energy – in this case gas – to Europe.

<p class="contents">Renewable energy sources exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste. Since 1992, Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens’ energy bills and building incinerators, which are scientifically proven to be bad for people’s health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option. Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and, despite formal legislative intervention, in Italy, waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy, with the Acerra case being just one example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that it may be difficult for you to remember the details of the situation concerning the CIP 6, which is why I have submitted a written question. However, I would ask you to confirm that incentives may not be provided for the incineration of non-biodegradable waste as a source of renewable energy and that there are no derogations in place for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know whether it is not considered inconsistent for the Waste Directive to establish incineration as a residual waste disposal option, while Directive 2001/77/EC encourages it as a form of renewable energy.

If you look behind the façade of environmental protection, however, a different energy strategy very quickly emerges: atomic energy as a so-called less polluting energy source. In his response to a question asked by me, Commissioner Oettinger made his position quite clear when he said that nuclear energy is currently making an important contribution to low carbon electricity generation in the EU and will continue to do so in the near future. The European Commission has no plans for a directive on the maximum service life of nuclear power stations. All this 25 years after Chernobyl – for indeed, we will be marking a sad anniversary on 26 April.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, finally we can see the light at the end of the tunnel on this subject, which is extremely important for patients.</p>
<p class="contents">We could no longer remain in a confused situation in which the law was decreed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The directive now sets clear rules for the mobility of patients within Europe. What type of treatment can one receive abroad? How and based on what criteria can one be reimbursed? How are the responsibilities shared between the Member State of affiliation and the Member State of treatment? All the answers to these questions now appear in the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, first and foremost, to thank the Belgian Presidency for its excellent work throughout the negotiations. Its capacity to convince played a decisive role, because it must be stressed that several Member States did not want this directive. I think that was a question of irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to my friend and former Member, Mr Bowis, who is in the gallery. As the rapporteur at first reading, he was also involved in creating this directive, and has always fought for patients’ rights. I would, of course, also like to thank Commissioner Dalli, and my fellow shadow rapporteurs, who all made a very active contribution to the conclusion of the negotiations, and without whom nothing would have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake here for patients? Medical progress means that healthcare can no longer be provided locally for all diseases and that sometimes, it must be provided across borders. This may be the case for patients who live in border regions, where healthcare provided abroad is sometimes closer than that provided in their own country. It may also be due to the fact that there are more resources and expertise available in another Member State, such as for certain highly specialised treatments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for some Europeans, it may quite simply be more practical to receive healthcare outside their country of affiliation because they have family living in another Member State. Consumers, employees, students and now patients will be able to benefit from mobility rights within the Union thanks to clear legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is not, of course, to encourage any sort of medical tourism, as social security systems, their organisation and their management remain the full responsibility of the Member States. Patients will now generally be able to receive all the healthcare to which they are entitled at home in another Member State, and be reimbursed up to the level of costs assumed by their own system.</p>
<p class="contents">For hospital treatment involving an overnight stay or using specialised or cost-intensive technology, the Member State may establish a prior authorisation system. This will mean that the needs for planning and investment by the Member States in their healthcare structure can be taken into consideration. Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the conditions for refusing prior authorisation are limited and set out in an exhaustive list, in order to give patients legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has made progress on other points, too: each Member State will have to establish national contact points to provide patients with the best possible information and guidance based on their needs. Each national contact point will act as a one-stop shop and must cooperate with the other national contact points. This will mean that patients receive clear and accurate information.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of reimbursement, which is, in fact, a fundamental obstacle, has been greatly improved, and either a compensation mechanism can be used, as is currently the case with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on social security, or the patient will have to pay up front and be reimbursed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ultimately succeeded in ensuring that patients suffering from rare diseases do not have to fend for themselves so much, and can access external expertise to diagnose the disease and help ensure that prior authorisation for healthcare is granted.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that, thanks to European cooperation in areas such as the European reference networks, patients will have access to highly specialised care, the aim being to encourage the sharing of experiences in order to improve performance, diagnosis and treatment in the interests of patients.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we can say to ourselves today that we have achieved our goal, and once again I would like to thank all my fellow Members. I could say that what is being built through this directive is the Europe of health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enikő Győri, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, Ms Grossetête, distinguished Members, let me continue in my mother tongue, Hungarian. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(HU)</span> I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate about the directive on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. This is a very important moment, because now, after two and a half years, our talks about this legislative act are coming to an end. First of all, let me express my thanks to everyone who made it possible for us to reach this very important agreement. First, to the previous members of the Presidency trio, Belgium and its predecessor, Spain, for the excellent work with which they contributed to the achievement of this compromise within the Council. Furthermore, on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its excellent cooperation and its willingness to reach a compromise, which resulted in this agreement. I am convinced that the agreement will provide many benefits to patients in the European Union, and that it constitutes another important step in guaranteeing European patients’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all remember, the talks between the three institutions were not easy, but they remained constructive and result-oriented until the very end, and were imbued with the spirit of compromise. I acknowledge that the debates within the European Parliament were not easy either, and that the report you will be voting on tomorrow reflects a compromise between the political groups in Parliament as well. I would therefore also like to express my appreciation to everyone whose work contributed to the establishment of a single position here in Parliament and, in particular, to Mrs Françoise Grossetête, with whom I have been sitting almost side by side in this House for a year, and to all co-rapporteurs, without whose cooperation this legislative process could not have succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the text adopted will create an appropriate balance between patients’ rights related to cross-border healthcare and the Member States’ obligation to organise and provide healthcare services and medical care. During the consultations between the three institutions, solutions that were acceptable to everyone could be found in several political issues. Above all, we agreed on issues relating to the quality and safety of healthcare services. We laid down the criteria for prior authorisation and determined the general conditions applicable to the reimbursement of the costs of cross-border healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we agreed on issues relating to the treatment of patients diagnosed with rare diseases, as well as on further cooperation between Member States in connection with e-health systems. The Council believes that we have achieved the most important goal, that is, the consolidation of the case-law of the European Court of Justice relating to the free movement of goods and services in the area of healthcare. There are, however, additional important factors which could contribute to patients having easier access to cross-border healthcare services in the future. Notable among these are the national contact points to be created by Member States, which will serve to provide information to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the mutual recognition of prescriptions between Member States, as well as mutual assistance and cooperation, are also significant steps. Last but not least, the directive will clarify the relationship with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems, thereby guaranteeing increased legal security for patients. During the implementation of the directive, Member States will be guided by principles which have already been acknowledged by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on several occasions. These are the principles of universality, the right to good quality care, equity and solidarity. I would also like to add that this time, we will also be able to decide on measures that are efficient and, at the same time, improve competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian Presidency is committed to the Council adopting this law as soon as possible. According to the legal procedure, the Council will adopt the text after the usual legal and linguistic finalisation, after which the directive can be published in the Official Journal of the European Union within the shortest possible time. Thank you very much, and let me congratulate once more everyone whose work contributed to the creation of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Ms Grossetête, and the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work and their commitment to patients’ rights. I would also like to thank the previous two presidencies – Spain and Belgium – for the hard work they did to conclude this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the new directive will provide a coherent and uniform set of rules for patients all over Europe. It will also generate a new phase of cooperation between 27 national health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The path towards today’s successful conclusion was far from easy. I remember last year, when I took up office, people told me that negotiations on the directive were at a dead end. The directive is a good example of the need for political leadership: it shows that, with courage and determination, decisions which are important for our citizens can be taken. I believe that legislators must not leave the European Court of Justice to decide in their place, nor leave citizens with no other means of having their rights recognised than by going to court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court recognised the right of patient mobility under the Treaty. It is the legislator’s role to decide how to deliver such rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to share with you some views on the directive. Firstly, the directive makes clear that all Member States have a duty to invest at home, to provide their citizens with the healthcare they need without undue delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will thus contribute towards reducing inequalities in access to care by helping to minimise delays across the EU. Patients will be able to seek primary care with the provider of their choice across Europe. As regards hospital care, the directive provides that, when the delay – I mean the waiting time for receiving treatment – is too long, the patient will be able to choose a provider in another Member State and will be reimbursed. However, what precisely constitutes an acceptable waiting time will need to be carefully considered and defined.</p>
<p class="contents">The main progress achieved by this directive, as compared with existing legislation, is that patients will be able to choose their healthcare provider and will have access to information on the quality and safety of the care they will receive. I can assure you that the Commission will carefully monitor how Member States implement the directive in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the directive will give patients access to information on their rights and on cross-border healthcare – information validated by national contact points and not left to private initiatives on the Internet or other media.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on quality of care, the directive offers transparency and accountability in relation to national standards. This should gradually lead to some convergence across Europe on the quality and safety of care.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the directive lays the foundation for European collaboration on health. While the cooperation networks set up by the directive are voluntary, I am convinced that all Member States will see that they have much to gain by working together. This is a matter of solidarity in Europe. I am therefore counting on the Member States to launch cooperation initiatives in key areas such as e-health and health technology assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also provides for European reference centres, which will facilitate the pooling of expertise and its dissemination across Europe. I believe such centres can lead to better healthcare for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Minister, honourable Members, the final compromise which is on the table today reflects the essential spirit and fundamental purpose of this directive: to enhance patients’ rights to cross-border healthcare, while taking into account the sustainability of health systems. This is a good day for the building of a ‘Europe for health’.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by making the following statement on an institutional aspect of the text:</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission has certain doubts that some of the future acts which the Commission has been given the power to adopt by the legislative act would be implementing acts. When exercising its implementing powers, the Commission will not adopt, on the basis of the powers granted, acts that it considers as being delegated acts within the meaning of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was totally unacceptable that the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) had granted patients the right to travel to another Member State, but that many Member States had not put this judgment into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The only option available to every single patient has been to take legal action and even to go as far as putting their individual cases before the ECJ. I think that this is a cynical approach, because these people are not strong. They are ill, otherwise they would not need treatment, and, in the worst case, they could die before the ECJ has decided on their cases. This is why it is high time for us to clarify the legal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête and everyone else involved have also achieved a great deal for those patients in countries where the judgment has been implemented to a greater or lesser extent, including the establishment of national contact points and European reference networks. The result has been an improvement in the situation in those countries where the ECJ judgment has, in principle, been put into effect, in the form of a move towards a Europe for patients and a healthy Europe, just as Mr Dalli has said.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have much time, so I would like to use my last 15 seconds to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Dalli the Commissioner, who has really committed himself to the cause and, above all, Mr Bowis, who is sitting in the gallery and is the father of this directive.

It means that the Member States have not recognised what they owe to their citizens, in other words, rapid, effective and high quality healthcare. It also shows that they would rather invest in other things than in these areas which provide services for their citizens and that is a disgrace. In addition, the negotiations in the Council on this subject are not something to be proud of. However, if this legislation is actually applied at some point, because patients need it, and that is not a good thing, I will be very pleased about what we have achieved. I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, and to my fellow Members for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a great deal. We have succeeded finally in putting the focus on rare diseases. People with these illnesses have always been sidelined and have found it difficult to obtain any treatment at all. We have at last managed to establish information points in the Member States which will inform people about their rights. There has been nothing of this kind available in the past. If reference networks are set up in future, it will finally be possible for the Member States to share best practices, information about gold and platinum standards and scientific progress. This has not been coordinated until now. There are some individual beacons of excellence, but no coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these things represent major successes, together with outpatient care and other areas which I will not go into now. Of course, there are also things that make me feel sad. I would have preferred not to have had the fuss and squabbling about prior authorisation, which simply shows that the Member States have not recognised the things that are really important. Fortunately, however, there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today. Our objective must be to ensure that the healthcare system in every country is so good that no one wants to travel to another country whose language they do not speak. If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this, because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services, which are doing something for their citizens and which are not, then we will have achieved a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that one of the minor side-effects of this will be transparency. We need to know which Member States have high standards and which are at a low level. I come from a country where I can feel relatively relaxed. However, I am aware of the problems of people in many other Member States and I feel ashamed about this, because it is not worthy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work and, in particular, the Commission, Mr Dalli and his team, who have given the European Parliament and the father of this legislation in the previous parliamentary term, Mr Bowis, as much support as we could have wished for. I would also like to thank particularly the Belgian Presidency, which is not present today, but which has done everything possible to ensure that this process was successful. Although the Belgian Presidency did everything in its power, it could not always achieve a great deal, because of the sometimes stubborn, antediluvian attitudes of other Member States. However, something has been done and I believe that we will be able to vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow with a clear conscience.</p>

I would firstly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, as well as the other shadows for their good cooperation and the great work accomplished, and also the father of this initiative, our colleague, Mr John Bowis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament remained united and stayed firm during the negotiations with the Council. We stood for patients and, for the first time, there will be a clear legislative framework in the EU for patients seeking treatment in another Member State. We have to consider the agreement reached as a small step, but it is a real achievement for patients in Europe, which will strengthen their rights while focusing on their needs, the information available to them, and the quality and safety of care.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, however, that Parliament would have supported a more ambitious result. Though I recognise the need for Member States to be able to set up prior authorisation to maintain the sustainability of their health systems, I regret that they – including the Belgian Presidency – have sometimes put organisational considerations above patients’ interests and needs. But we represent our citizens and are responsible for representing them here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just mention one example: quality and safety. While Member States were keen on establishing quality and safety risks as a criterion for the refusal of prior authorisation, they have been reluctant to accept – and have opposed – any system for the sharing of information and upgrading of requirements in this field at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group welcomes the future directive, but we will be strict about its implementation and make sure proper reporting and monitoring is in place to ensure that the directive is correctly implemented, and that the prior authorisation and reimbursement provisions do not become an unjustified obstacle to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me highlight one of my regrets: the lack of ambition of the provisions agreed for cooperation in the field of e-health, again due to strong opposition from the most advanced Member States in this area. The initial proposal from the Commission has been significantly watered down. I would therefore like to ask Mr Dalli the following question. Would the Commission consider the development of a stand-alone proposal on e-health, fostering cooperation and enabling interoperability of data and safety for patients, thus making it a reality in Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were concerns about whether market forces would win out over services of general interest; and that people who were concerned about patients’ rights to choose, and to travel, were being pitted against those who were asking which patients would actually exercise that choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I think what we have, at the end of the day, is a reasonable compromise. As people have pointed out, in cases where things are medically necessary, with a need for urgent treatment, we already have a system in place under social security coordination. This directive is more concerned with the market system, with choice, and with people’s ability to choose where to go, and to have money follow them. So we have clarity now, in that Member States can put in place systems to enable them to ensure that needs can be met.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty: with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies; with the question of redress if there are problems; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of rare diseases, we have also achieved a compromise that is better than what we were pursuing first time round.</p>
<p class="contents">As people have said, for many patients, this will work well, but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it is precisely two years six months and 16 days since the European Commission submitted the long-awaited directive on patient rights in cross-border healthcare, but the history of this directive goes back long before, when this issue originally formed part of the Services Directive. It is now clear what a huge mistake it was to leave health services out of the Services Directive. We must not forget that the agreed directive addresses only the rights of patients, and the issue of the free movement of health services in the EU remains unresolved. The health systems in the Member States may be based on the same general principles, but the organisation of healthcare provision varies greatly between individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The text we will vote on tomorrow, and which I support, is a major compromise between the rights of citizens and patients, and the concerns of Member State governments. Despite the many concessions and adversities, the submitted proposal represents a small but important advance. The proposed directive clarifies, albeit imperfectly, the rights of patients, providing them with access to information, fully confirming, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the exclusive responsibility of Member State governments for organising and financing healthcare, and for the quality, safety and accessibility of care within their territories, giving them the possibility to specify the rules according to which a citizen must, where appropriate, seek consent before receiving care abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that we will also continue to work on the directive in this Parliament in the coming years, and that we will improve patient rights in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new directive treats healthcare as a piece of commercially tradeable goods. Those who have the most money will be the first to access the places with the largest and cheapest supply of care. This proposal, however, will maintain the existing two-tier healthcare system. I wonder how many of my fellow Members can identify with what I’m saying. Healthcare is a basic need and one to which everyone should have equal access. Those of you who are going to vote in favour tomorrow are probably thinking that you will be striking a blow for patients, but that will most definitely not be the case. I am in favour of anything that advances the rights of patients, but if we adopt this directive, we can actually expect numerous problems in the area of patient rights; I will give you a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Insurers will be only too happy to send patients across the border if there is a cheaper treatment option there. That will decrease the supply of care in the patients’ countries of origin. Any treatments that are no longer profitable will no longer be offered in the more expensive regions. Far from giving them more rights, that will leave patients with no choice and they will <span class="italic">have</span> to travel across the border. Besides, patients from regions where care is cheaper will not be able to travel to other regions, as they will not automatically be compensated for the additional costs which that will entail. Health tourism, which is the intended objective of this directive, will, therefore, be restricted to just the rich.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to regions where healthcare is cheap and to those where waiting times are short. Eventually, they will have <span class="italic">so</span> many health tourists coming in that their own local patients will be squeezed out. We were able to read an example of this in Monday’s edition of the Belgian <span class="italic">De Standaard</span> and I can assure you that more such examples will follow. I believe that every patient has the right to quality care and care which is provided in their own language, close to where they live, with their family close at hand. Instead of that, Europe is encouraging patients to seek care abroad and then letting the market do its work. Those of you who agree with that will vote in favour tomorrow; those of you who agree with me should definitely vote against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During discussions in committee and in trialogue, we reached an agreement on a text that is balanced on the whole and which takes into account the needs of healthcare quality and safety, the general principles of reimbursement, prior authorisation, cross-border cooperation on the treatment of rare diseases and electronic health services.</p>
<p class="contents">We set out to achieve the goal of recognising the right of all patients to cross-border healthcare, thus preventing medical tourism. The costs that are incurred by a health service to treat a national of another Member State should rightly be borne by the patient’s State of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wanted to oblige Member States to guarantee basic levels of healthcare, but this was not possible. In view of the improvements to the text achieved through mediation, we will be voting in favour. This also applies to the other text under discussion concerning the European initiative on Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, which is a preliminary step towards submitting a legislative proposal aimed at achieving integration between the various existing policies.</p>

Numerous examples have demonstrated that a large number of patients seek appropriate healthcare services in other Member States. We are all familiar with the Kohl case in Luxembourg, which is proof positive of this phenomenon. Unfortunately, the external and internal differences within the EU, by which I mean the differences between the Western European and Eastern European regions, are not confined to economic differences and differences in social services. There is also a wide gap in respect of healthcare, and it is the task of the European Parliament to reduce these differences, that is to say, the differences between Western and Eastern Europe, as healthcare of a uniformly high standard of quality can provide the means to reduce the number of people from one Member State using the healthcare services of another. In addition, it is vital to standardise the role of health insurance companies, as thereby we could ensure that there would be no prejudice to the universal European principle of the freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that it is important to coordinate the recommendations of the professional college to ensure that the individual Member States apply the same treatments to the same disease categories. Health must not be a privilege, and the same diseases cannot be treated differently in Hungary and in Sweden just because the former is in Eastern Europe and people live under less favourable financial conditions, while the latter belongs to Western Europe and people there are better off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not because it affects a lot of people – most people, of course, want, and have a right, to receive good, timely care where they live. It is because, for those it does affect, it may be incredibly important. It may even be a matter of life or death. This also concerns the fundamental idea of European cooperation – free movement. It is actually disgraceful that we are only now extending the freedom of movement to those who need it most; those who are sick, those who are patients.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a compromise, and I know that both I and my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would have gone further on many aspects, but we must now remember how things stood not so very long ago, with all the talk of healthcare tourism, the threatened collapse of national healthcare systems, the requirement for advance notification, or, to put it plainly, as patients, we were to be forced to ask permission before exercising the rights that the European Court of Justice has given us. That was how things stood before and, in light of that, the fact that we have a decision at all constitutes an enormous success.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not regard this as a decision that we are taking as a result of what the Swedish or European Left has done, but rather in spite of it. I remember the previous wording and the fact that, for example, the Swedish Social Democrats abstained from the vote on this at first reading. Yesterday, someone called for the introduction of advance notification in Sweden. I hope that Sweden does not do this. We have managed without advance notification for many years and I hope we will continue to do without it in the future, too.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our decision will be made here in the European Parliament tomorrow, and then it will be up to the Member States and the Commission. Implement this so that we strengthen patients’ rights instead of reducing them. That is my plea to the Member States. To the Commission, I would say: keep a close eye on the Member States, because we know that they will want to avoid implementing this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should not, however, confuse patient mobility with the medical tourism that has developed over recent years. The latter is becoming organised and, unfortunately, is proving to be increasingly profitable. Health is gradually becoming a competitive market.</p>
<p class="contents">A German goes to Hungary for dental treatment, a British national – if he has the means – goes to France so as to be operated on more quickly. There are numerous examples of this. However, we must ensure that health is not treated as a commodity, so that we are all equal. This is why, over the last three years, we have defended the principle of prior authorisation by the Member State of affiliation for hospital and non-hospital treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteurs – Mrs Grossetête and our socialist rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, whom I would particularly like to congratulate – which has enabled significant progress to be made, such as, for example, the reimbursement of care, the establishment of national contact points and European reference networks, the treatment of rare diseases and enhanced cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, our work is not finished. We need to go further, beyond the progress that has been made, in order to eliminate the disparities that we still have in Europe, and I know that together, we can ensure that European patients and citizens receive equal treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, it was the Court of Justice that was responsible for these issues, which is the reason for the legal uncertainty that we are now eliminating, and I think that we should be very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, the shadow rapporteurs and also Mr Dalli for their work. This legislation improves patient information, quality of care, costs and reimbursement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also satisfied with the prior authorisation system for more expensive treatment, including hospital treatment, specialised treatment or treatment presenting a particular risk for patients. The aim is obviously not to prevent patients from receiving treatment abroad, but to prevent medical tourism and also prevent risks to social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have mixed feelings regarding the conditions for implementing this procedure, which could present risks of unequal treatment among patients from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, what does ‘a reasonable time’ mean? We must take care to ensure that the term ‘reasonable’ does not put patients’ needs at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also see to it that the Member States establish financial procedures to ensure that patients, particularly those who are least well off, do not have to pay too much up front. It would not be acceptable for administrative difficulties to diminish patients’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the various decisions of the Member States regarding the reimbursement of costs incurred for healthcare could also lead to inequalities between patients if there is minimum reimbursement, on the one hand, and something else, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, those are the points that I wished to make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I want to travel abroad, the situation will be clear and the decisions will no longer be arbitrary, as was the case in some countries. In addition, better information will be available if I choose to go to another country. However, the directive will have to be implemented by the national governments. What the directive has prevented from happening is something which some members of the Commission and perhaps of this Parliament have dreamed of, and that is the opening up of borders in order to improve national healthcare systems. I am proud of the fact that with the two rapporteurs, including Mrs Grossetête, we have succeeded in maintaining a balance. We have shown our opposition to health tourism and our support for ensuring that the national systems are not undercut. The directive will not resolve the problem of differences in the quality of medical care. This can only be achieved by sufficient levels of investment in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dalli and the Commission, I would be pleased, now that we have this directive in place, if you would focus more closely on the regulation on social security, which is the system on which everything is based, and which makes it clear who is paid and where everything is well organised. You should put more pressure on the Member States to ensure that this regulation is implemented more effectively, instead of coming up with new ideas about deregulation and competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken an interest in this directive as the implementation will have a particular impact in my constituency of Wales where, despite the UK Government negotiating with the EU on health matters, the subsequent management and delivery of healthcare is a devolved competence delivered through the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
<p class="contents">My initial concerns are at the potential impact on the Welsh healthcare system, regarding reimbursement and prior authorisation, have been resolved as a degree of flexibility has been built into these proposals. The ability for Member States and regional pairs to have the capacity to decide on eligible treatments with prior authorisation and a setting of a cap on reimbursements will go some way in alleviating concerns about the already overstretched and burdened healthcare systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the work of my colleagues in this Parliament, past and present, especially Mr Bowis, we can be content in having taken a step forward in ensuring clarification for patients, improved healthcare choice and greater cooperation between the different EU healthcare systems. This should lead to a rise in standards throughout the EU, through patient choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal will exacerbate the inequalities between Europeans, harming those who do not have the means to resort to private health services or to healthcare in another EU Member State. Even with the amendments that have been included in it, its adoption and the very high costs that it could involve would have grave consequences for some countries, not least Portugal and its National Health Service.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, the same European Union that is imposing severe restraints on national budgets when it is a case of financing public services, such as health, is not concerned about overloading these budgets when it is a case of channelling public money into any private economic and financial group involved in the healthcare business, or into encouraging medical tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in its eagerness to promote business, this proposal has not provided the proper safeguards for user safety or healthcare quality, particularly as regards non-hospital healthcare. In contrast to what some people have said, the prior approval system does not make adequate provision for these cases. It is therefore necessary for these intentions to be blocked as well, in a similar way to what happened in 2007 with the exclusion of healthcare services from the infamous Bolkestein Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament, namely, established in the first reading a good foundation for the correct application of the rules of cross-border healthcare provision in the Member States in such a way that patients could, where justified, and in compliance with the stipulated rules and without burdening the courts, receive the outpatient or hospital care they need in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore good that in drawing up the report in committee for second reading, it was possible to continue the original philosophy expressing the position of Parliament from the first reading and, starting from the currently opaque situation in cross-border healthcare provision, progress to a dignified solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise text, backed by the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and submitted for today’s debate, provides our citizens with new possibilities and new quality in healthcare, and we must therefore – in my opinion – strive for this directive to be applied in everyday life as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, even given the best possible national healthcare systems, there will still be cases where patients will need or want help, support and medical treatment from another country.

<p class="contents">It was also important to clearly establish the safeguards in order to prevent any form of medical tourism, but also to introduce sufficient flexibility into the text in order to encourage diagnosis and treatment on both sides of a border. I am thinking of certain diseases in particular, such as rare diseases.</p>

They all have disadvantages as well as advantages, but this directive definitely raises more hopes than fears. Europe, despite the rapid changes which are taking place, remains a continent of great differences and even contrasts. This concerns both the level and the scale of healthcare, and it is evident that more fears are being expressed by the poorer countries, which are at a stage of transformation and are trying to catch up with the wealthier ones. The level of funding and provision for medical needs in countries which are undergoing transformation is, however, far, far lower.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive, therefore, is a huge opportunity and a source of hope for all patients in the countries to which I refer. Governments are facing a great challenge, but paradoxically, in fact, this directive will force many reforms and will draw attention to the scale of the under-funding of healthcare, because under-funding is not only the result of the limited financial capabilities of these countries, but is also the effect of mistakes in current policy and of underestimating the huge importance which health has for European citizens.</p>

My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment. This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector. If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally. Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients’ welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector. I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live. This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That being said, this proposal is the best that we can achieve. We are ensuring that the financing model is changed and that the national health systems are not undermined, while, at the same time, making sure that patients get better opportunities to be treated in other EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Patients can more easily seek treatment in another country if, for example, the expertise and treatment offered is not found in their home country. This is important when it comes to very rare diseases that require very specialised knowledge. If we can concentrate the treatment of these rare diseases into a few places in the EU, the patients’ chance of recovery are much greater, as doctors who use their specialist skills frequently are better at achieving good results. However, this should not mean that the Member States thin down their health systems – something that the text also states. Thank you Mr President, and I would also like to thank Commissioner Dalli and the rapporteur. Thank you for your excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was not an easy job, because of the different positions of the European Union’s Member States and the different healthcare systems in different countries. Achieving a compromise between expectations and possibilities not only required negotiating skills but, above all, needed knowledge of the subject. We are all aware that the measures contained in the directive on patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare – and the rapporteur has spoken about these measures in great detail – are what is wanted by the residents of the European Union, particularly in those countries where access to specialists and modern procedures is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that during work on the text of the directive, and thanks to the compromises which were reached, it was possible to change the attitude of Member States which initially blocked its provisions. The essential features of the directive are accessibility, ease and certainty with regard to healthcare, and also the patient’s right to use the healthcare services of another Member State and to have specified costs reimbursed. The directive is based on patients’ needs, and not on financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the provisions of the directive will mean not only an improvement in the condition of patients’ health, but I believe that it will be the basis for improving the systems of healthcare in some countries of the European Union. It should be emphasised that the directive is the first and a fundamental step towards patient mobility, strengthening patients’ rights and eliminating inequalities in the level of services in different Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More importantly, their work has also meant that the role of the Member States of origin that have to pay and of those in which treatment is received can be clearly regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, believe that we should be satisfied with this alone, but rather that it should be the beginning of a much greater step forward, so that, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt was saying, this directive becomes just a formality because the level of equality achieved in all Member States means it is unnecessary for each citizen to be returned to their country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this battle, what we need to achieve is legislation that guarantees citizens’ rights in relation to the care they should receive – benefits and safety – rather than just the right that they already have to mobility between Member States.

The story is almost laughable. In the beginning, there was Mrs Gebhardt’s report, which was supposed to enable the free movement of services around the EU. We separated off part of the report and resolved that health services deserved a special standard. When the Commission finally submitted the directive, the free movement of health services was then gradually removed, leaving us the part which describes the right of patients to move freely around the European Union when looking for health services and healthcare provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise by this that our European-ness is sometimes more about these banners and symbols than about implementing the practical freedoms on which the Union is supposed to be based. The directive has provoked numerous concerns among individual Member States regarding over-exploitation and the wrecking of national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that this is not quite what we wanted, but it is the right move and surely a step in the right direction. I would like to extend my best wishes to the rapporteurs and to thank them for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remind Parliament that at one point, it seemed as if the whole legislative process would fail. I believe that it is due to the skill of the rapporteur and the negotiating team and, of course, the Belgian Presidency, that we have a result that we can be very satisfied with. I am particularly pleased that the right of Member States to put restrictions on treatment in another country has been more clearly defined. This was not the case in the proposal put forward by the Member States. I think that we now have a decision that will allow the process of rejecting a request for treatment to be traced and verified. This is an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Who are we helping, in particular? I believe that we are helping the 60 000 people who are on waiting lists for organ transplants. We have, of course, already adopted the directive on organ transplants, but this is another measure which will reduce waiting times. We are also helping the millions of people suffering from one of the 30 000 rare diseases. They will be able to receive more targeted and better quality treatment if they travel to another country.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not think that this directive will result in the development of health tourism in Europe. I think that the fears expressed by those on the left of this House are totally unfounded. This is not an issue that we need to concern ourselves with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only fair to acknowledge the progress achieved, because this new version provides more guarantees regarding safety and service quality. Although the wording of Articles 7 and 8 has been improved, I believe that more could have been done towards ensuring greater equity.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of patients, especially those from weaker socio-economic groups, do not want to be treated abroad because of the language barrier and lack of family support. Higher income Europeans do not face these obstacles. I therefore fear that, in countries with healthcare systems that are universal and mainly free, the new legislation could act as an incentive to reducing investment in national systems and could contribute to creating a healthcare market for the rich.

<p class="contents">I am perhaps a little more cautious about it than some Members are. I think it would be wrong for the news to go out from this House that, from now on, all is well with cross-border healthcare. We still have much to debate and to put in place to make this work. Can I just quote – and I hope I do it accurately – the Commissioner’s own words? He said it was ‘clear that all Member States have a duty to invest at home, to provide their citizens with the healthcare they need’. I see him nodding in agreement, so I have got the quote correct.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that we have that message to take back to Member States which are not doing this and to those which have long waiting lists. My own country, Ireland, is included here. The truth is that people would prefer to be treated close to home. That is why we have endless protests – and very valid protests – in Ireland about the closure of local hospitals and local services. That said, this directive may work if it forces Member States and their health providers to look at their services at home and to improve the provision of services to those who need them. They are going to have to pay for them anyway if our citizens take up the rights that this directive will give them.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, people already have a right to travel for cross-border healthcare under Regulation No 883/2004 but they do not know about it. If they did, we would see many more cross-border patients moving to get their services. So let us inform our citizens of what they are entitled to, and let us hope that we do not have to travel across borders but that, if we do, we are able to do so freely and will have the services we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I would like to note that it was worthwhile to discuss this matter outside the context of the Services Directive, as the issue of cross-border healthcare has numerous unique characteristics. I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, as well as John in the gallery. It is, however, extremely important not to call into question the Member States’ obligation to provide primary care. Member States are responsible for providing care to their own citizens. It is very important to affirm that this directive is not a privilege for the wealthy, but a tool for providing better care to patients with rare diseases. We were guided by this purpose in our work. It is also a very important consideration that the directive will enable us to make better use of natural conditions. I am referring, for example, to Hungary’s spas, which can cure certain diseases much more effectively and are immovable. Obviously, it is the patients who must come to us. It is very important to continue along this road, so that the healthy, the sick, the European citizen can feel that the European Union is about them and for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when we find ourselves in a precarious medical condition, we automatically begin to understand how important it indeed is to us and how vital it is to have a proper health system, not just a good system, but an efficient and effective one too.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union citizens can benefit from medical treatment from around the different Member States when their condition is not curable in their own country. We must keep in mind that this should be the last resort and that it should not be encouraged, as it is the most expensive option and, in addition, impractical. We should only resort to it when there is no other course left to take. However, when the latter turns out to be the case, we have to ensure that the bureaucracy involved is reduced to a minimum, and that we improve upon the quality of access and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must also be furnished with the necessary tools to protect their health systems and to cope with the extra influx from other countries that they might have to deal with. It would be ideal, therefore, were the Member States to be granted authorisation beforehand. What clearly emerges within this context is that the current rules that are in place are not adequate – on the contrary, they are unclear and inconsistent. However, as we saw in the organ donation case, we must endeavour to come up with solutions so that Europe can progress in this area and offer the best medical services to its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that today’s compromise formulates the same sort of payment conditions that some of us were advocating for the Services Directive seven years ago. I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my colleagues, Mrs Grossetête and Mr Bowis, who I salute for the achievement of this acceptable agreement and also for drawing up important safeguards for the enforcement of this right. I believe that the right to mobility will make treatment for serious conditions accessible to all Europeans, and will ultimately lead to shorter waiting times for operations throughout the EU. One of my lifelong personal goals in the area of healthcare has thus been fulfilled. I would like to add that we still face a range of issues, for example, resolving on-line healthcare services, the mobility of health workers and others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you may have learnt, Romania belongs to the group of countries which have had reservations about a series of compromises which have been reached within the Council. These reservations are not an indication of Romania’s opposition to cross-border healthcare. They conveyed the Romanian Government’s concern about the financial stability of cross-border healthcare and the proportions it may assume because, as you are very well aware, some Member States have a very small national income.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, investments offer a means of reducing this risk.

It not only has a father, Mr Bowis, but also a mother, Mrs Grossetête. I would like to thank them very much for all their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have spent a long time discussing the right path to take and we now know that we are not yet on the fast track. However, we have a firm, well-designed foundation on which to build. The situation is a complex one. We have 27 Member States all at different starting points, both in terms of the structure of their healthcare services and their insurance systems. Prior authorisation for a hospital stay in another Member State and the recognition of the ethical and moral principles of each country’s healthcare legislation represent the right approach. On the one hand, this enables support to be given to insurance companies and national responsibility to be encouraged and, on the other, it allows all citizens to have access to the services offered by other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major step forward, particularly with regard to rare diseases. Every Member State has a different level of facilities. However, all of them can now benefit from research findings and the structures already in place elsewhere. In addition, specialists will have the opportunity to develop their skills further, because of the increased demand resulting from more people having access to services. For the people in my region, which is close to the border with Luxembourg, Belgium and France, cross-border access to health services is a major benefit and will enrich their everyday lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal clarifies and facilitates access to cross-border healthcare, along with the Member State of affiliation’s exercise of its right to reimbursement. It is a step forward in the process of European integration, in the strengthening of solidarity, and in the Europe of the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have shorter waiting lists, improved quality of healthcare, competition and an incentive for scientific research. Rare diseases are a priority, and diagnosis and treatment can now be carried out in the Member State most suited to that end. This directive is for all Europeans who need healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Minister for Health is therefore quite wrong when she says that this option is for better-educated people with greater financial resources: that is what happens now, without the directive. Portugal has excellent healthcare and excellent healthcare professionals, and cannot remain on the margins of this important project. The country must take advantage of this directive to modernise even more and compete in terms of being able to provide services in this area to all Europeans in need of them.</p>

This directive will also put pressure on all states to provide a high quality service because, in its absence, our citizens will want to travel to another country where that service is available. Finally, not much has been said about e-health, but that is a very important resource as well, and we will hear more on the topic in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight four of its elements. First of all, the establishment of national contact points is extremely important for obtaining information – that is, obtaining information by patients. It is vital to know exactly when conditions should be subject to prior authorisation. This is very important in the case of rare diseases. It is also crucial that, as a general rule, patients cannot be required to make payments in advance. Finally, I would like to point out the issue of cross-border healthcare regions, which is of extreme significance to Hungary and Central Europe, as along the German-Austrian border, or along the Hungarian-Slovak or Hungarian-Romanian border, where linguistic boundaries do not overlap national borders, there are many underdeveloped, redundant and unexploited healthcare capacities, while language barriers are non-existent.

This directive is essential for our people, because the current system is complicated and it is difficult to obtain appropriate information. Furthermore, scientific progress is very uneven and therefore, this directive would provide patients with the opportunity to obtain appropriate treatment in another Member State, if it is not currently available to them.

This is surely a positive outcome. The complexity of the discussions, however, has made clear not only the differences between health systems in the various Member States, but also the different financial terms under which healthcare is provided to European citizens. The fact that this is a highly sensitive problem can also be seen from the current mass resignations of frustrated doctors at Czech hospitals. The background to this includes the risks or uncertainties arising in relation to the impact of the directive, for example, in the sense of health tourists seeking high quality but cheaper healthcare.

This directive creates the preconditions to a Europe with no borders in the medical sector. Patients suffering from serious chronic diseases can now obtain specialist care, they have greater mobility and more comprehensive information from contact points, and they have the facility to cover their costs without fuss. The new Community directive creates new challenges, pressure to modernise the national health systems in the 27 Member States of the European Union and, unquestionably, the need for ongoing networking and cooperation between all the medical systems in the 27 Member States of the European Union, with the objective of exchanging best practices, promoting e-health and achieving permanent improvements in the standard of cross-border healthcare. This is a challenge that we need to address …</p>

I am very pleased to see this directive being adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I cannot agree with the inference that this initiative promotes health tourism or enables health insurance companies to reduce costs. Rather, it is an assurance that citizens in need of healthcare can be in a better position to get it, freeing them from bureaucratic shackles that sometimes preclude them from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the directive is a real breakthrough for patients and for reinforcing a Europe of health. I must agree with Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs McGuinness and others that this should be an incentive for Member States to invest in their own healthcare systems because, as I have said in public many times referring to this directive, we do not want to make nomads out of our citizens. We want our citizens to get the best treatment they can get at home.</p>
<p class="contents">With this directive, patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare are now enshrined in EU legislation, but our work does not stop here. I refer here to Mrs Parvanova’s question about possible stand-alone proposals on interoperability. I must say that interoperability is also key to making this initiative, this directive, operational and implementable, because I cannot see us implementing this directive in a really good way without a proper interoperable e-health system. On the other hand, interoperability is also very important for increasing equality in healthcare and improving the sustainability of healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">I now look forward to working together with the Member States to see this directive properly implemented and enforced throughout the EU. Much remains to be done, both at European and national level, to ensure that cooperation between health systems in Europe becomes a reality. You can count on me to pursue this challenge with all my determination and energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it illustrated very well the points that had been the most difficult to deal with for the participants of the debates during the past years, both in the Council and in this House, and I am also very pleased to note that the overwhelming majority of Members were in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, this directive will create a clearer situation and a more transparent system to serve the European citizens. As it will become evident at the programme presentation to be held tomorrow, the Hungarian Presidency intends to put people at the heart of its programme. It has also become conspicuous that what we have created here is not perfect. There is still room for further work, as Mr Dalli mentioned just now.</p>
<p class="contents">I found that the debate about the single market and the Services Directive, and how all this ties in with patients’ rights, was very interesting. I believe that it was a very smart solution that we did not approach the issue from the side of services, as everyone remembers what an uproar the Services Directive caused when it was first adopted. It was a correct step to create this directive through the issue of patients’ rights. It will enable the free movement of patients and will still allow patients to have access to services of a better quality and at the right time. I therefore believe that, though through a different approach, we did reach our goal. What is very important is that this directive will reinforce the freedom of choice in addition to the principles of equal opportunities, the right to good quality care, equity and solidarity, which I have mentioned before.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, I am very happy to see this directive created during the Hungarian Presidency. The credit, however, does not go to us but to our predecessors, Belgium and Spain, as well as to the Members of this House. I am thankful that the excellent cooperation between the Council and Parliament could serve the European citizens to such an extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from each political group – I can see Mrs Roth-Behrendt, but I am thinking of all my fellow Members and I cannot mention them all. I want to thank them because they all played an active role in and made a major contribution to the efforts to reach this political agreement with the Council on 21 December, which will be successfully concluded tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">To those fellow Members who have expressed some reservations regarding medical tourism, among other things, I say ‘No! We are taking care of that’. The directive contains a safeguard clause for the Member States and enables them to be in control of planning their healthcare and infrastructures, precisely to prevent medical tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who think that this directive is not ambitious enough, I say, ‘You are right, I, too, would have liked it to have gone further’. However, we need to consider today that we are at the first stage of this directive, and I can see that Commissioner Dalli, who has helped us a great deal in this respect, agrees with me.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, we are going to ensure first and foremost that this directive is transposed under the best possible conditions. In 30 months’ time, this directive will be applied, and we will all need to be vigilant in our Member States to ensure that it really does promote patients’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that tomorrow’s vote is essential. I am expecting you to ensure that this directive is a great success, because that success will be a gift to patients, as finally we are going to recognise patients’ rights to high quality healthcare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Hungarians share his opinion. Although the compromise now made, which can be considered a sound compromise between patients’ rights and Member States’ concerns, greatly differs from the previous draft report, the opportunities still remain. We could say that this is a small step in the right direction. What are these opportunities? While earlier, many envisioned the sudden influx of unrealistically large numbers of foreign patients and the collapse of national healthcare systems, my opinion is that instead, it represents a chance for us to make better use of the natural assets of our country in the future. I am not only referring here to our medicinal waters, but also to our geographic position and the cost of qualified workforce. Healthcare workers will finally have the opportunity to better exploit their professional skills and any surplus capacities they might have. Patients who will, in other Member States, have unobstructed access to healthcare services not established in their home countries due to certain natural conditions, will also benefit from this. Thus, both healthcare workers and patients will benefit, but the Member States can also rest assured, thanks to the numerous restraints incorporated in the directive. I congratulate the rapporteur and all my fellow Members who contributed to this success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a success for Parliament but, above all, it is a victory for users. The new legislative framework will enable citizens of any Member State to receive healthcare in another Member State under the same conditions as they would enjoy in their own country. Such mobility will enable patients to avoid national waiting lists completely legitimately, and to take advantage of the medical services on offer in other European countries. It also clears the way for specialisation, particularly in rare pathologies, so that healthcare need no longer be provided locally but can be given in places that specialise in that particular treatment. We are not aiming to promote medical tourism with this, but rather ensure Europeans’ full mobility within Europe under equal conditions, meaning that from now on, we can all choose to seek treatment wherever it might be fastest, most effective and of the highest quality, and be reimbursed for the costs by the Member State of affiliation, under the exact same terms as if the healthcare had been provided there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These patients will have better access to treatment in another country than they do now. There is also the hope that the new measures will stimulate change in national healthcare systems. This concerns, in particular, a reduction in the long waiting lists for people waiting for certain kinds of hospital treatment. The risk of outflow of patients to hospitals in other countries will force administrative decisions to be made on the best use of hospital beds and procedures in the countries which have the longest queues. The obligation to establish contact points in every EU Member State is important for patients. This will give them more information on the options for treatment in another country, and also on the record of hospitals in other countries in the treatment of rare or very serious conditions. After the new legislation comes into force, it will be important to carry out detailed monitoring of its effects, and its influence on improving the quality of services as well as accessibility for different patient groups in different regions of Europe. In particular, it will be important to gather information on who is using these services – only better informed and affluent social groups, or all who need treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rules of access to services and reimbursement must be clear and well-known to Member State citizens. The aim is to enable citizens to have access, without prior authorisation and in any Member State, to those non-hospital and hospital treatments for which they would also be eligible in their own Member State, and have the costs reimbursed to them to a specified extent under their own systems. The risk of possible abuse – I refer here to ‘medical tourism’ – must not constitute a barrier in this case, but naturally, we must do everything within our power to reduce it to a minimum.</p>

In some cases, prompt cross-border medical assistance can save lives. An additional important aspect is that cross-border healthcare also has great significance in cases where the appropriate level of treatment for a certain disease is not available in one Member State but is available in another. I believe that the proposal is balanced and represents a compromise between the Member States’ reservations and the European Parliament’s ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive allows all patients – not only the best informed or richest – to enjoy a series of healthcare rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Member States retain full responsibility for organising and managing social security systems. The proposal concerns patients and their mobility within the EU, not the free movement of service providers. The directive stipulates cooperation between Member States, especially with regard to recognising medical recommendations (treatments, prescriptions, etc.) made in another Member State, e-health and HTAs (high technology assessments). The reference network created by the national contact points will facilitate the public’s access to this information. Indeed, the Romanian authorities must ensure that their citizens have access to information. Adopting this report will help guarantee a good balance between the rights of patients in the EU to have access to the best medical treatment and safeguarding the financial sustainability of the national social security system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was essential in order to safeguard our social protection systems that we re-establish a prior authorisation system for hospital or cost-intensive treatment. Similarly, the reference to Article 168 of the Treaty was necessary in order to ensure that the prerogatives of the Member States in terms of organising their public health systems were respected. Finally, commendable progress has been made in terms of cooperation and patient information.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, still major deficiencies: the lack of consideration given to the mobility of professionals, medical demography and the ageing population. Other legislative proposals should remedy this – in particular, the proposal regarding professional qualifications – and in those proposals, it will be important to reaffirm that health is a sector with specific characteristics and not a commodity governed solely by the laws of the market, but rather the most precious asset that citizens have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marisa Matias,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I should like to start by giving what seems to me a clear example of the urgency of this initiative. We began work in Parliament exactly six months ago: six months have passed between starting work on the report and the time of voting, during which more than 700 000 people have developed Alzheimer’s or some other form of dementia. This figure on its own shows how important and urgent it is to take action in this area. That is why the Commission Communication is timely.</p>
<p class="contents">All people suffering from Alzheimer’s and other dementias in Europe must be treated the same. There are more than 7 million people with Alzheimer’s and almost 10 million suffering from dementias as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were talking about numbers, we would be talking about the scale of a medium-sized country. We cannot discriminate against a disease in the same way that we cannot discriminate against a country. We must treat them all equally. It is for this very reason that it is urgently necessary to take action in several areas. In the area of research, we know that the number of people suffering this disease doubles every 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that if the age range considered is over 65, the number doubles every four years, which is exactly why we need to tackle the causes and discover the causes, because we have no other way to take action against a problem if we do not have a good knowledge of it. To achieve this, we need more research, more cooperation and more epidemiological data.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to know more about how to take action in terms of prevention and of controlling risk factors. We need early diagnosis, we need specialised care and we need to train carers. We need to give support to families and to not stigmatise sufferers: we need to give them rights and to give them dignity. We need all countries to have national action plans so that we can then cooperate at European level. We need to combat inequalities between the Member States and within the Member States. We cannot accept that there should be first- and second-class patients: they must all be equal, regardless of sex, age, place of residence or any other criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, it is very, very important for our health services to have the maximum coverage possible. We cannot avoid talking about these urgent needs just because we are in crisis and are always talking about the disease’s costs. The social and economic costs of failing to treat this problem are far larger, far greater than those of facing up to it. That is why we have to face up to this problem and invest: invest in people; invest, as I said, in preventing and giving support to the families and carers who are so often forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that, for every person suffering from Alzheimer’s, three people are needed to care for them. A person suffering from Alzheimer’s cannot go one hour unaccompanied. This must serve as a lesson to us: we cannot continue without the Member States linking up in their response to this problem; without cooperation and, moreover, cooperation on the basis of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to say the following: on the subject of cooperation, we all know that none of this work can be done in isolation and here in Parliament, too, it has been undertaken in cooperation with all the shadow rapporteurs from all the parliamentary groups; with the support of the three women who helped me in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in my parliamentary group, and in my delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to thank all these women, and perhaps it is no accident that it was only women who worked on this report: this is because women are the most affected, dealing both with reports about Alzheimer’s and with sufferers of Alzheimer’s, including men. I therefore also want to draw attention to the types of discrimination obscured by the lack of treatment or response to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by saying that I should like to question Commissioner Dalli directly, so as to ask him which of the proposals included in this report the Commission is prepared to accept, and when it will be prepared to accept and take action against an emergency of the scale that we are currently experiencing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This question refers to a case in which a small European business has been denied justice because of the inertia that the Commission has unfortunately demonstrated from 1997 until now. This finding is supported by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has been asked to issue an opinion by the committee which I chair.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue concerns a medical device – specifically an asthma inhaler – which was patented in 1990 and lawfully placed on the market. This product is regulated by Directive 93/42/EEC, which stipulates that manufacturers must certify that they have complied with requirements and which empowers the national authorities to verify that this self-certification is valid, through monitoring and sample checks.</p>
<p class="contents">The product, which was successfully distributed on the market for six years – thus, until 1996 – and for which not a single specific complaint or comment was recorded in over 15 years, was submitted for an inspection by the government of Upper Bavaria, which asked the commission of Magdeburg to review the authorisation granted to the company.</p>
<p class="contents">In December of that year, the commission and the Minister for Health in Saxony-Anhalt carried out this inspection and concluded the procedure by stating that the product fully complied with the legislative requirements in force. At the end of the procedure, they also questioned the legitimacy of the request made by the government of Upper Bavaria and invited it to initiate the safeguard clause procedure pursuant to the aforesaid directive if it continued to have doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">The following year, there was a series of undocumented activities about which we were only indirectly informed, and then, suddenly, in 1997, without any communication with the manufacturer, the Federal Minister for Health ordered the product to be withdrawn from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministry initiated the procedure – the procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the aforesaid directive – at the end of 1997, but it drew a blank, because no information was provided and the process of consulting the manufacturer was not initiated. Amid the general silence, in mid-2003, the manufacturer, thinking that this silence meant that the German authorities’ unexplained comments had clearly been refuted, placed the product back on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in 2005 – and again without any communication – the German authorities ordered the product to be withdrawn from the market once more. To be clear, despite repeated requests, there has been no explanation to this day for why the product was withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, there has been no communication, no investigation and no opportunity for the manufacturer to legitimately challenge the other party’s findings. This has had a serious economic impact on the manufacturer, because he has been waiting for a response for more than 15 years and cannot place his product on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also add that, during the six years in which the product was distributed – and there are documents on this, including ones provided by the Commission – it was found that significant savings were made in public health expenditure due to the low cost of the product, and that the product had a positive impact on asthma sufferers.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2008, having seen all his attempts to get somewhere with the other authorities fail, Mr Klein, the manufacturer, turned to the Committee on Petitions. The committee is initiating the procedure during this legislative term. Moreover, in view of the length of time the matter referred to in the petition has been going on, it is also launching an informal consultation process with the Commissioner to request that a response be provided within a shorter timeframe, because the petitioner is requesting confirmation that his product complies with European legislation or, failing that, at least to have a ruling that he can challenge before the Court and which will therefore allow him to have justice.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this has happened, and during the debate within the Committee on Petitions, the European Commission unfortunately avoided answering our questions once again. Hence, the committee has taken the unanimous decision to come to Parliament and ask the Commission to provide clear answers in this House, because this affair undeniably raises serious doubts with regard to a violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is not only because of the Commission’s inertia; it is also and, above all, because of the petitioner Mr Klein’s inability to take legal action.</p>
<p class="contents">The affair raises obvious doubts with regard to the violation of market rules and the protection afforded to small businesses, which is why we are insisting that answers be provided, here, to the points raised in our question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares your concern. Dementia means great suffering for millions of Europeans and their families. With a population ageing fast, now is the time for Europe to act.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Commission put forward a Communication on Alzheimer’s and other dementias in 2009 with action to improve prevention and diagnosis, research and best practice exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Parliament is supporting ongoing work in this context and presenting a comprehensive set of recommendations. This report and its recommendations are very timely at a moment when the Commission is about to launch a joint action with the Member States on Alzheimer’s in April, the so-called ALCOVE (ALzheimer COoperative Valuation in Europe).</p>
<p class="contents">I am persuaded that this joint action will deliver on many of the recommendations that you are adopting here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint action will focus on prevention – an area which Parliament underlines in this report – and also on improving knowledge and data and sharing good practices. It will also address another area where Parliament is calling for action: the rights of people living with dementia. I agree with you that we need fully coordinated research to understand better how to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. This is why the Commission has launched a joint programming initiative on combating neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, 23 countries are working together to tackle Alzheimer’s. There are good practices across Europe on diagnosis and treatment for Alzheimer’s and the Commission is fostering exchange of knowledge and good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As recommended by Parliament, I can also confirm that the Innovation Union initiative under the Europe 2020 strategy will take as its first pilot area for the new European innovation partnership the topic of active and healthy ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">Action to support people suffering from dementia could be developed in this context. A good example could be the ongoing Parliament initiative on carers. We hope to be able to support further innovative actions in this area which may also address the issues of Alzheimer’s and other dementias.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission looks favourably at a number of other recommendations, including declaring 2014 as European Year of the Brain. Let me assure you that the Commission is committed to doing its share to address dementia.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now address the second topic in this debate: the petition filed by Mr Klein, the inventor and producer of the inhaler ‘Effecto’.</p>
<p class="contents">The placing on the market of the device in question was originally refused in Germany in 1997. This decision was not pursued further, either by the Commission, the German authorities, or the manufacturer. The then distributor indicated at the time that it would conduct further studies before placing the product on the market again.</p>
<p class="contents">The device was placed back on the market in 2002 under a new name. When the product was again prohibited by the German authorities in 2005, the Commission carefully analysed the case and concluded the procedure by formal letter to the German authorities and the manufacturer in July 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission analysis was that the prohibition by the German authorities was justified because the clinical data provided by the manufacturer was insufficient to demonstrate the safety of the device.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Medical Device Directive, safety has to be demonstrated by the manufacturer in order for him to be allowed to use the CE marking. This meant that the applicable legal provision was Article 18 of the directive which addresses cases where a product is placed on the market with improperly affixed CE marking. In this case, there is no formal Commission decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Since, in the Commission’s view, the case is not one to which the safeguard clause procedure applies, it has no reason to request notification of the 2005 prohibition adopted by the German authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The obstacle which the petitioner faces in placing the product on the market is the decision of the German authorities (the 2005 prohibition) and not a decision of the Commission. The petitioner had clear legal avenues which he could pursue at national level and, indeed, he has made use of these opportunities. His claims, however, were rejected by the German courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the Commission has, since 2007, invited the petitioner to bring the device into compliance by providing the missing clinical data and has facilitated contacts between him and the German authorities to that end. To the Commission’s knowledge, no action has been taken by the petitioner so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Matias, on the fine job she has done. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this dossier, I also want to thank all my fellow Members who made their contributions. The attention enjoyed by this dossier indicates what an important subject it is and, at the same time, the severity of this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of people suffering from dementia is up to 9.9 million, with Alzheimer’s patients accounting for the majority. By 2020, we expect this number to increase dramatically at a time when the disease is still underdiagnosed in the European Union. Inequalities exist between Member States with regard to prevention, access to treatment and care. Action is fragmented and responses are unequal in terms of research into and fighting against this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The report marks an important step in the fight against this disease in the European Union and is essential for introducing a new form of cooperation between Member States, enabling coordinated measures to be taken to combat certain problems affecting the whole of Europe. The report supports solidarity between states and the exchange of good practices to avoid duplication of effort and wasting resources. I would like to stress the importance of preventive diagnosis and early intervention at the initial stages of the disease. I believe that this is key to making progress in the fight against this illness.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would also like to recall the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach to research in this area. Compartmentalisation between disciplines and the tenuous link between primary and clinical research, public health and social research influence how scientific discoveries are transferred into medical practice and the provision of care. The fact that all these are carried out at national level increases fragmentation. This is why we must focus on the multidisciplinary approach and on transferring discoveries and knowledge at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of those statistics was my own mother who passed away last year. I therefore strongly welcome this European initiative on dementia.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be very concerned that only half of cases are estimated to have been diagnosed. We should be very concerned that twice as many women as men suffer from dementia, and we should be very concerned that with an ageing European population, the number of sufferers will double in the next 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that a five-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s means 50% less prevalence rates, I welcome the focus on prevention and early detection by the Commission. I welcome the focus on better research in Europe, especially as we know that 85% of research today is without EU coordination. I also welcome the focus on the sharing of best practices and the rights of sufferers and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I, and my fellow Social Democrat MEPs, focused on the social aspects of dementia in our amendments and we urge the following:</p>
<p class="contents">We call for a strong focus on the specific needs of women, who account for twice the number of sufferers and a disproportionate number of carers, in the areas of medical and social research, health, employment and social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We renew our call on the Commission to legislate for mental-health-at-work policies, as part of their health and safety at work responsibility to incorporate persons with mental disorders into the labour market in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We recommend an examination of the use of living wills across European borders, which are so badly needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we also highlight the importance, in all awareness and education campaigns, of the ability to recognise the symptoms of dementia.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Maria Matias, and thank her and my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me add that I welcome all the initiatives that have just been announced by Commissioner Dalli.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of cerebral ageing is experiencing explosive growth in Europe and worldwide: more than 7 million people are affected, with this figure rising to 10 million if one considers other types of neurodegenerative illnesses. We can, and should, welcome the current EU funding of 32 research projects, but we must do better, much better, especially in terms of the coordination of research into Alzheimer’s in the Eighth Research Framework Programme as early as 2014. This is clearly specified in point 21 of our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital to focus on a multidisciplinary approach embracing diagnosis, prevention, treatment and support for the recipients of care and for their families; this is covered in points 2 and 20, which are very important. In this regard, moreover, a recent study, which has just been published in France, reveals the considerable socio-economic costs resulting from this disease: more than EUR 10 million a month for the medical care and supervision of patients alone. And that does not include the enormous dedication of the patients’ loved ones and families, who devote more than six hours a day to the care and management of the patient.</p>
<p class="contents">Helping these patients also means getting the diagnosis right. The scientific world tells us that international criteria must now be changed because, through the strict application of often obsolete criteria, too many patients who have other forms of dementia are often included.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, which is covered by point 64 of our resolution, it is crucial that Parliament finally responds to the appeal from researchers. More volunteers are needed for the clinical studies if we hope to find a cure one day, which we must. The upcoming revision of the Clinical Trials Directive is therefore a golden opportunity to provide a concrete response and to give hope to the families affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All over Europe, the costs of medicines and health insurance are rising, and everybody is trying to find ways of bringing them down. Medical progress is making medicines more and more expensive. The case we are dealing with here is different. There are 30 million asthmatics in Europe and we have a small manufacturer that has developed a device that makes inhalation – which can be a life-saver for asthmatics and is extremely important in their treatment – better, faster, more efficient and, above all, cheaper. This manufacturer has been denied access to the market for 14 years. The manufacturer turned to the Commission back in 1996 and the Committee on Petitions has been dealing with the matter since 2006. Commissioner Dalli, it is the Commission’s job to help enforce the law and to be on the citizens’ side. In this case, that is not being done; instead, the Commission is refusing to make a clear decision – a decision that would help the petitioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address you quite personally, Commissioner Dalli, for you will recall that we invited you along to meet with the Committee on Petitions and discuss the matter. You told us that you did not have time for that, but that you could find time for a personal conversation. We came to you and spoke to you personally. You personally promised me that you would take care of the matter and find a solution very quickly. To date, I have heard nothing. I wrote you another letter, but I have received no reply. You have also tried to prevent the next debate. That is not the way the Commission should act.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to state very clearly that the European Parliament expects the Commission to be on the side of the law and of the citizen – and we will be voting together on this resolution tomorrow. We expect you to guarantee that such small manufacturers are protected from those who wish to deny them access to the market. There is a lot of money at stake here, but more particularly, it is also about people’s health. We are aware of the problems. We cannot understand your actions, Commissioner Dalli. We know all your arguments. I have looked through mountains of files, but I have yet to find a clear argument to substantiate your position. We are talking about a medical product. A full 30 000 are in use – people have inhaled millions of times, with excellent results. We have letters from insurance companies asking us to allow access to the market so that costs can be saved here. I expect the Commission to finally do its job and reach a positive decision on this matter.</p>

Legislation is clearly secondary in what primarily needs local support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, firstly by bringing this topic to this Chamber, we can bring it to the forefront, open discussion and increase public awareness. Leading from this, Member States can decide on its prioritisation and sharing of best practice. Secondly, awareness can lead to a greater understanding of the symptoms and, consequently, early diagnosis. There are drugs on the market that can assist here and, if taken at the correct time, can slow down the process. The important point is this: sufferers are helped, families have information and support and, ultimately, the patients are helped to retain their dignity through this difficult illness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Alzheimer’s is a cruel disease. It strips sufferers of their personality, it takes away their independence and robs them eventually of their relationship with family and friends. It is a devastating disease which places huge burdens on families and carers, who are often isolated and in poor health because of the burdens they face. As has already been mentioned in this House, many of those who care are women.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom, by 2050, the number of those with dementia is estimated to soar to approximately 1.7 million. The estimated cost of health and social care by 2018 will be GBP 27 billion. These are staggering figures, which make research absolutely vital and the careful targeting of resources in medical and social care an absolute imperative. I also believe that we should recognise the contribution of the voluntary and community sector in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have made much of healthy and active ageing and I am proud to highlight the work of the Mullen Mews scheme in Belfast, which has driven off international competition to win awards for its social inclusion and improvement of the lives of those who live with dementia and their families and carers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would have liked to have seen these matters being dealt with one after the other at least.</p>
<p class="contents">I am returning to Mr Klein’s petition. I am pleased that we have the opportunity to talk about it, because the Committee on Petitions has been dealing with this petition for some considerable time. What has happened in that time? Here was an innovative manufacturer which developed an inhaler for asthmatics. It was good for patients because it was easier to use. It was good for the insurance companies because it was cheaper. The manufacturer quite rightly won an award for it. Then came a sudden blow: the inhaler was banned by the German authorities, as a result of which the European Commission began a safeguard clause procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into all the details once more, I am convinced that the initial 1996 ban on the inhaler was not legitimately imposed. The Commission would have been required to conclude the safeguard clause procedure with findings, in order to allow the party concerned to appeal. As a result, Mr Klein – and I am quoting the position of our own Committee on Legal Affairs here – has been the victim of a flagrant denial of justice. Commissioner, I am not in the business of apportioning blame. What is important here is to find a solution as soon as possible to deal with the problem once and for all. I am simply asking you to respect the unanimous vote of our Committee on Petitions. I am hoping and relying on your cooperation and assistance – not just in the interests of the petitioner, but also in the interests of patients throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate now that Europe’s population is ageing. We obviously need to carry out research and more studies into the causes of and treatments for dementia. However, as in the case of non-transmissible diseases, there is evidence indicating that a number of simple measures in terms of lifestyle choice can prevent many disorders. This is why I have asked in the amendments which have been tabled for much more importance to be attached to carrying out research into the impact nutrition has on the occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us will certainly know at least one person affected by this disease or another form of dementia. We know that, in actual fact, the personal cost is much higher than the social or financial cost. We are all concerned about the very widespread, devastating effects of dementia on such a large number of people. As a result, we have an extremely comprehensive report which contains all the key issues. What we want is a positive response not only from the Commission, but from Member States as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current medical and social burden of this disease represents a serious threat to the sustainability of our healthcare and social systems. Several other chronic diseases will significantly increase in the coming years and it is crucial that we should also address them in a comprehensive way with an appropriate preparedness plan.

Alzheimer’s disease and dementias are a very big issue for society. The human and financial cost are enormous. It is estimated that it costs more than EUR 100 billion a year to treat Alzheimer’s disease. That is more than what the Commission estimates it would cost if we tightened up our target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 30%. The number of Alzheimer’s patients is thought to double every 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress the importance of early diagnosis and making prevention a priority. In particular, I hope that there will be more research into how chemicals that hinder the development of the nervous system might contribute to the incidence of Alzheimer’s and the risk of other diseases that cause deterioration of the nervous system. In any case, the precautionary principle dictates that there should be a reduction in the use of these chemicals as pesticides in our gardens and in fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me focus on two aspects. The first is the issue of home support for patients who are seriously ill. We know that, for medical reasons, it is important for patients not to suffer any upheaval in their environment, which may aggravate the disease and its symptoms and make things much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our priorities must be to enable patients to stay as long as possible in their usual environment. For this to happen, families and those family members who help the patients must, in turn, be helped. In other words, the families must not be left to fend for themselves. This is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns research. Why? Because, ultimately, for Alzheimer’s disease, the hope is to find a drug and, to find this drug, effective research is needed. I have heard people say that more resources are needed for research. That is doubtless true! Most of all, however, before we talk about resources, we need to talk about the use of these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Research has so far been too fragmented and spread too thinly. No priority has been defined. People do not work together and do not talk to each other. In the future, the cellular biologist must talk with the physiologist, with the radiologist, with the neurologist. We must get people to work together better. I therefore call on the Commission to throw all its weight behind the joint research programme, which was launched during the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to conclude by saying to patients and their families that things are moving forward. They must have faith, they are not alone. They are no longer alone! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Whilst this report on Alzheimer’s is very important, we know that the power for implementing policy lies mainly with the Member States. But the ageing population is one of the most pressing challenges for the future and we know that dementia is one of the main causes of disability and dependence among the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, the main responsibility of care tends to lie with the spouse or child of the dementia patient, which can be extremely hard work and emotionally gruelling. This is why our amendments that call on the Commission to consider the opportunities for creating jobs from a better care sector in the EU 2020 strategy are so important. It is also important that we focus not only on providing research funding into new drugs to treat diseases, but also look at simple preventive measures that everybody can take such as a change in diet and lifestyle. Nutrition is increasingly being shown to be an important factor in the development of Alzheimer’s and other dementias and we need to dedicate some of our resources into investigating this further.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of dementias in the EU was EUR 130 billion in 2005 and it affected 19 million people – that is, sufferers and carers. So it makes sense, both morally and economically, to ensure that we put more funds into work into this terrible disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the importance of prevention and early diagnosis. Campaigns raising awareness of the first symptoms are essential, so that patients and their carers are able to benefit at the earliest possible stage from any treatment and support that is already available. However, in addition, the importance of joint programming of research resources cannot be overstated. Many of you have already mentioned that 85% of public investment in research is nowadays made without any European coordination and this inevitably leads to fragmentation and duplication.

It has to be acknowledged that with the ageing of Europe’s population, Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia are spreading at a dangerous rate. Often, the symptoms of these diseases are incorrectly diagnosed or detected too late and patients do not receive adequate treatment. The invitation to declare dementias one of the priority areas of healthcare is right. Only by disseminating information as broadly as possible and increasing society’s awareness of the disease, its symptoms and early methods of diagnosis, will we be able to deal with the rising wave of dementia. Unfortunately, in the majority of the new European Union Member States, including Lithuania, care for dementia patients is particularly unsatisfactory. The greatest burden usually falls on patients’ relatives and family members. The Member States should give credit to their work by regarding, as far as possible, time spent caring for relatives as a period of employment, and providing social guarantees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been looking into this case since spring 2007. In autumn 2007, I addressed a question to the Commission. The answer was more than unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had many discussions with the German Ministry of Health and with other authorities. Everything was always very vague and unformed. From your answer, Commissioner Dalli – from what you read out – I take it that you have no inclination whatsoever to look into this case in more detail. It did not happen during your period of office, but there is such a thing as collective responsibility, and I would ask you – also on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Petitions – to make available to us all the documentation on which your decision was based. Moreover, looking at the device, I would like to know – although I can imagine the answer – why certain companies have no interest in a different product coming onto the market. Installing this plastic part in the inhaler is relatively cheap, but the margins lie in overall sales.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the lobbying engaged in by the pharmaceuticals industry, and looking carefully at the financial interests that certain parties have in keeping small companies out of the market, the answers are sometimes all too apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to make your position clear here and now as to whether you will make the documentation available to us and whether you are prepared to have a proper discussion with us in the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Legal Affairs, rather than simply pushing the matter aside. Our citizens have a right to be treated properly – and that includes those that may not be particularly wealthy or large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Statistics show that one person out of every five above the age of 80 suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. Not everyone is aware of the fact that this is an incurable disease, but with appropriate preventive measures and early diagnosis, its effects can be delayed. According to the World Alzheimer Report 2009, 28% of the global population suffering from dementia lives in Europe, second only to Asia in this regard. In Poland, the country which I represent, about 250 000 people suffer from Alzheimer’s, and specialists estimate that by 2040, this figure will have trebled. As you can appreciate, these statistics are disturbing.</p>

<p class="contents">Alzheimer’s is a disease that is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 44 000 people in Ireland and nearly ten million people across Europe. It is a progressive disease, which means that over time, more parts of the brain will become damaged and, as this occurs, the symptoms become worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, due to the ageing population in Europe, more and more people are likely to be affected by this disease in the future. Therefore, better coordination between EU Member States, in terms of research into the causes of dementia and best practice in terms of a care system, is essential. The burden of care is often placed on the shoulders of close family members and in Ireland, 50 000 people care for people with dementia on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to pay special tribute to those carers and to the Alzheimer’s society of Ireland who provide incredible support to people affected by dementia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the large multinational pharmaceuticals industry that has decided, in the German case, that this plastic gadget and the medicine belong together. Here is the medicine. This is what has to undergo the major testing. The plastic gadget is just like using a syringe. However, it is clear that the pharmaceuticals industry makes a huge amount of money from the fact that the two products must always be sold together. Society, on the other hand, saves a great deal of money by being able to reuse something again and again. I think it is absolutely scandalous that the Commission is continuing to maintain that this simple product is to undergo the same substantial test procedure – as if it necessarily belonged in the same test system – as the medicine – not exactly the same as the medicine itself, I know, but still as a device that belongs to it. It is simply appalling that we have not received a clear response in this matter.

<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s report and its recommendations. Let me take this opportunity to stress that the Commission is fully committed to doing its share to address Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. These conditions are, unfortunately, part of the ageing process for many European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is our collective responsibility to work together to minimise their burden and to invest in innovation to prevent, diagnose, treat and manage these conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to supporting Member States in their efforts to work closely with Parliament in addressing Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.</p>
<p class="contents">On the ‘Effecto’ Klein petition, I must state first of all – referring to Mrs Mazzoni’s statement that the Commission’s job is to stand by the citizens – that I can assure you my job is to stand by the patient. It is very important for me, as Commissioner responsible for health, not to compromise on patient safety, not to take any shortcuts and short-circuit the processes and procedures that we have in place to ensure that any device to be used in any medical way is properly tested and its safety assured.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here is not how to deliver a medicine with a piece of plastic, as has been said. The issue is that we need clinical evidence that the product is safe and to do this, the petitioner, in this case Mr Klein, was requested to conduct clinical studies on 24 patients. That is the extent of the clinical tests that were requested.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is there a resistance to providing these clinical tests? What is causing this resistance? This is something that I am asking myself. We need to know, for example, is this product universal in application, is it to be used with one specific medicine, is it to be used with different types of medicines? If it is, do these medicines require different dosages? Is there an adjustment system in the device to adjust the dosage? As a layman, if I had to use a device like this, these are the questions that I would ask myself. This is the kind of thing the authorities have been asking themselves. They have been asking for proof that this device would be safe in the hands of patients at large.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, as I said, a proper safety assurance procedure, and I will be not short-circuiting that. It has been said that I promised to look into the case. I promised to look into the case, and I did look into the case. I have had a lot of details about the case. Naturally, these are details that I had to learn from others who have been here in the Commission since 1987. When Mr Klein asked for a meeting with me or my cabinet, I immediately agreed. My ‘chef de cabinet’ informed him that we were prepared to have a meeting to explain it. He sent an e-mail back setting a lot of conditions, amongst which he stated that as a basis for this meeting, the EU Commission should completely take over the expenses.

We all know that the situation that we are experiencing is very tragic and that it is also very underdiagnosed, which has already been mentioned here.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to mention one issue that cut across all the speeches that were made, but which was probably not emphasised enough, which is the issue of the dignity of the patients and their rights, but not just those of the patients: also those of their family members, of those caring for them, whether these be formal or informal carers, and of the professionals associated with this type of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy, really happy, with what you said, Commissioner, about sharing the same concerns as the European Parliament, and that the European Commission views all the recommendations tabled by Parliament in the report positively and will do everything in its power to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that every day that passes is later than the last in this area, given the urgency of what we have before us. Therefore, we also know that Parliament is going to make an announcement on this subject tomorrow. We will await the result of the vote, Commissioner, but we know that the European public is expecting a great deal more of us than solidarity and moral reassurance. Europeans expect specific and suitable measures, Commissioner, and I really hope that you and the Commission – which has initiative that this House unfortunately lacks – will make this issue as much of a priority as you say you will, and that you transform it into a legislative initiative, so that the rights of Europeans and their families are respected and all of them are treated with the equality and dignity that they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With Europe’s population ageing, Eurostat estimates that twice as many people will be suffering from a neurodegenerative disease in 2050 as were in 1995. Moreover, since the burden of care falls on family members, it is estimated that the disease affects three members of a patient’s family. In this regard, it must be ensured that action is taken at EU level to help Member States to give appropriate assistance to patients and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree that EU health policy should prioritise dementia. Proper recognition must be given to patient and carer organisations, and those same organisations must be involved in information campaigns and in the preparation of research programmes. The EU gives a considerable amount of money – EUR 159 million – to 34 neurodegenerative disease research programmes, but since there will be a huge increase in these diseases, research projects under the Eighth Framework Programme must be broadened to include research on behavioural, cognitive and non-drug therapies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alzheimer’s disease was, and is, the main cause of dementia in all countries. It accounts for 74.5% of dementia cases in North America, 61.4% in Europe and 46.5% in Asia. However, there are cases of Alzheimer’s disease in the European Union which are undiagnosed. According to the recent epidemiological data available, only half of the people suffering from this disease have been identified at the moment. In this context, I think that Member States must develop long-term policies and action plans for speeding up access to research funding in the field of dementia and Alzheimer’s, including research into prevention, at a level commensurate with these illnesses’ economic impact on society. They must also anticipate and prevent social and demographic trends and focus on the support provided to the families of the patients being cared for by them, thereby affording social protection to vulnerable people suffering from dementia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am of the opinion that an effective, coordinated Europe-wide action is needed to make further progress in research and the collection of epidemiological data on this disease. Proper coordination between Member States can contribute to the sharing of best practices in patient treatment and help make citizens more aware of the importance of prevention and early intervention. Investment and cooperation are essential in this field not only to reduce the social costs of these diseases but also, and above all, to ensure that those affected can be given the hope of leading an increasingly dignified life. In this vein, I should like to point out that dementias do not, of course, only affect sufferers; they also affect the people around them, such as family members and healthcare workers. The European strategy should therefore aim at ensuring more effective and practical support for those who have to face the daily task of helping these people, closing the gaps that exist in professional training and launching campaigns to raise awareness of the realities of living with Alzheimer’s. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, it is worrying that countries like Malta still do not offer any refund for medication needed by patients suffering from the disease. Notwithstanding that the Commission cannot interfere with the organisation of national health insurance schemes, the Commission should step up its efforts to put pressure on Member States to guarantee that any person suffering from Alzheimer’s is getting the necessary treatment. I call on the Commission to truly make the fight against dementia a European priority and conclude the below-mentioned proposals within a reasonable timeframe: (1) promote cardiovascular health and invest in a healthier workforce; (2) promote initiatives that ensure social and intellectual engagement of the elderly; (3) encourage Member States to implement systematic routine screening which allows for early diagnosis of the disease, as well as providing easy access to medication and treatment once the disease has set in; (4) ensure that regular epidemiological studies at a European level are carried out; (5) prompt Member States to make better use of Assistive Technology (AT). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, one in 20 people over the age of 65 and one in five over 80 suffer from dementia. It is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans aged between 30 and 99 suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, and scientists anticipate that this number could double every 20 years. Alzheimer’s disease represents 50% of these cases. Nearly ten million Europeans suffer today from dementia, with Alzheimer’s the most common form. There are 44 000 people in Ireland with dementia. There are over 50 000 carers for dementia suffers and an estimated 100 000 people are directly affected by dementia. Given that a five-year delay on the onset of Alzheimer’s means 50% less prevalence rates, I welcome the focus on prevention and early detection by the European Commission. I welcome the focus on better research in Europe, especially as we know 85% of research today is without EU coordination. For any European strategy in this area to work, it is crucial that the various countries give priority to drawing up national action plans. A European strategy must also seek to safeguard the existence of services that guarantee maximum possible coverage and equal conditions and treatment for all patients. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Approximately 10 million Europeans suffer from them at the present time. The majority of them have Alzheimer’s disease. Many factors influence people’s ability to remember things and learn something new. They include stress, depression, sorrow, heavy drinking, a poor nutritional state and medications. More attention needs to be paid to the prevention of these diseases from the time when people reach adolescence. Exercise, mental activity, healthy food options and avoidance of intoxicants will protect people from developing diseases that cause memory loss. By dealing with the risk factors associated with these diseases, we will, at the same time, be dealing with those associated with cardio-cerebrovascular conditions. In future, the importance of information and NGOs in the fight against memory loss diseases needs to be emphasised. Organisations do very valuable work. They should be given more support to enable those who suffer from these diseases to receive help more satisfactorily. Furthermore, more attention must be paid in the future to treatment centres and their quality. Unfortunately, those that exist do not now meet the demand. In Finland, for example, there is a lack of peer support and suitable centres offering day care and long­term care. Finally, I would like bring to everyone’s attention the importance of support for professional staff specialised in the treatment of memory loss diseases, their proper training, and the development of their skills and competence.

Every one in five Europeans will contract a disease that causes memory loss. These diseases continually put more pressure on healthcare systems that struggle to cope with an ageing population, but also on sufferers and their relatives when faced with a situation that is new to them. There is no consensus on the pathogenesis of these diseases, but early intervention in their progress is considered vital. This report will help make memory loss diseases a priority among the EU’s health objectives. The result of the vote will send the right message, which is that research into these diseases and their treatment will require cooperation at pan­European level. Although it is older people who mainly suffer, with improvements in diagnosis, the early symptoms of these diseases will be detected more and more frequently among the working population. In order to tighten cooperation in Europe, we also need national memory programmes, which have already started in some Member States. National memory programmes play a significant role in the spread of knowledge and best practices and in reducing the number of actions that overlap with one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These figures will continue to rise as a result of increasing life expectancy. The own-initiative report is moving in the right direction with its call for a more efficient approach to the treatment of dementia, and especially of Alzheimer’s. Particular attention should be paid here to prevention. Early diagnosis, free screenings for risk groups and, above all, making the population better informed have a key part to play in this, since Alzheimer’s is generally identified at too late a stage in the EU. The continued spread of dementia calls for a European strategy that, as far as possible, offers comprehensive structures which provide patients with equal access to information and treatment options. It should not be forgotten that support for relatives and carers is also a part of this. Furthermore, broad epidemiological and clinical studies as well as better research into dementia and Alzheimer’s are important factors in the fight against dementias. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, no less important in my view is the area of support for the families of dementia sufferers, and an emphasis on non-discriminatory access to high quality health and social care is fundamental. The role of local authorities, whether municipal or regional, is of key importance here, as are the voluntary organisations, which can respond operationally to the growing need for these services. The European initiative on Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is also very important for starting a serious and open social debate on this condition in the broadest sense of the word.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Utilisation of European funds</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to a recent article in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, the European Union has only spent 10% of the EUR 347 billion allocated for the period up to 2013 to promote the development of poor regions.</p>
<p class="contents">That article also states that funding earmarked for SMEs has come to be used by multinational companies (Coca-Cola, IBM, Nokia Siemens) while other large companies (Twining, Valeo) are using EU funds to transfer their operations to countries where labour is cheaper, thereby violating rules explicitly prohibiting that practice.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johannes Hahn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Financial Times’s scrutiny as it represents an important contribution to opening and broadening public debate about the efficiency and effectiveness of cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the habitually slower take-up at the beginning of a programming period. However, the most recent data show that the Commission made more cohesion policy payments in the fourth quarter of 2010 than ever before. The vast majority of the payments made were interim payments, i.e. reimbursements of expenditure already made and certified in the Member States. Thus, it is certain that, as has been seen in previous programming periods, cohesion policy spending is accelerating. Absorption rates, in terms of EU payments to Member States, are now at 21% for the Cohesion Fund, 22% for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and 23% for the European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
<p class="contents">As regards support provided to multinational and large companies, the Commission would emphasise that a primary objective of cohesion policy is growth and the creation of new jobs for particular regions and Member States. Any support for productive investment has to be seen in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting job creation and economic growth can be achieved in many ways, from setting up small enterprises to supporting larger companies. Cohesion policy intervention supports productive investment that is primarily targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises, as specified by the ERDF and ESF regulations. The Commission also stressed the role of small and medium-sized enterprises during negotiation of the current programming documents. The vast majority of productive investment and investment in the development of endogenous potential is targeted at SMEs. However, there may be cases where, in line with the regulations, cofinancing is granted to larger companies subject to compliance with the objectives of the funds and programmes concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, cohesion policy has allocated some EUR 55 billion to business support between 2007 and 2013, a large share of which supports innovation in SMEs. The Commission would like to point out that multinationals are not beneficiaries of the support extended by the ESF. Workers receive the cofinanced training. The ESF supports people. It is about providing training and retraining and improving skills to prepare people and help them find a job. A worker who has been employed in a given enterprise may well then find himself or herself engaged in another company. Therefore, what matters is the skill capital that workers manage to build to sustain their inclusion in the labour market, not the name or type of enterprises providing the training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that, from a policy perspective, firms should not receive European funding for investments which would lead to the loss of employment by the same company in another region of the European Union, because the net effect of the ESF investment might be zero or even negative. In cases where a company which has received cohesion policy support closes down, or ceases to support a project, within five years – or three years in the case of SMEs – this funding needs to be paid back.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point – but it is a crucial one – is that while there are clearly areas for improvement, this cannot and should not overshadow the major positive impact that cohesion policy is having. I would like to assure you that the Commission is not shying away from the problems. Indeed, in the past, we have proposed changes, some of which were taken up, and we will continue to drive improvement of cohesion policy. Cohesion policy brings clear benefits to the poorer regions of the European Union, but it also clearly benefits the rest of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where research infrastructure is concerned, small and medium-sized enterprises already receive considerable resources from the European Regional Development Fund, particularly in the area of encouraging innovation – where they receive innovation subsidies into the high tens of billions of euro. In the period 2000-2006, more than 30 000 enterprises in total concentrated on this area in a focused manner. We are giving consideration to the fact that substantial importance should also be attached to the research infrastructure, particularly in the future – not just in the area of the economy, but also in the area of basic research. It is possible that even in the current period we will subsidise a research infrastructure project that is also included in the ESFRI – the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures – Road map with such funds for the first time, because investigations into this project have revealed that it has a very sustained impact in a region beyond that of the project itself in that jobs will be created, not just research jobs, but also jobs in enterprises that supply these, since even basic research infrastructure needs services and supplies. In other words, it could be a real hub in a particular area in a region – in this case, a region of Hungary. That should also send out a signal for the coming programming period, perhaps to universities, which, in the final event, also have concrete effects. Already today, nearly a third of university research activities are in the area of applied research, which, in the end, benefits the economy and creates lasting jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the honourable lady’s question, within the framework of the European Social Fund, it is generally employed or temporarily unemployed workers who receive assistance with training, in order to put them in a position in which their prospects on the jobs market are improved. This may be within the enterprise in which they are employed or, if they are not employed, it may be in order to improve their skills or simply to make them better qualified generally for other possible types of employment. I can give you an example – because perhaps that is what you were hinting at and because it has come in for a lot of criticism – and that is that McDonald’s workers, for example, have been offered further training. A clear distinction must be made here: these were further training measures for McDonald’s workers in order to make them better qualified on the jobs market and in the world of work. As you know – it has, after all, been somewhat criticised – jobs at McDonald’s, often nicknamed ‘McJobs’, are generally part-time jobs that may require no great qualifications; jobs that are often done by students. It is a matter of upskilling these people. Where in-house further qualification is concerned, such as in this project, McDonald’s – to take an example – bore all the costs itself. In other words, we are trying and endeavouring to ensure that the further training that workers receive concentrates on their own personal qualifications. In view of this, I believe that it should make no difference where these people are employed; rather, our objective must be to improve further the quality of each person’s skills in order to make people more fit for an increasingly mobile labour market, thereby avoiding unemployment wherever possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only three months after the entry into force of the decision, the Commission finalised the mandate for the European Investment Fund to launch the guarantee operations for microfinance providers.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, the Commission established a specialised investment vehicle. As a result, the first micro-loans will be provided starting from this month. I am also pleased to report that the Commission has been successful in securing additional funding for micro-entrepreneurs in Europe. The European Investment Bank will match the European Union’s contribution of EUR 100 million, and further contributors are expected. As a result, the overall volume of loans under the Progress Microfinance Facility will amount, as planned, to around EUR 500 million. This money will benefit unemployed people, people facing social exclusion or vulnerable persons who face difficulties in accessing the conventional credit market. Ensuring outreach to these target groups and promoting geographical balance are key elements of the mandate given by the Commission to the European Investment Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Operations approved so far, or under preparation, suggest that both objectives will be met. As from early 2011, micro-loans will be provided through a start-up microfinancing institution in Belgium which focuses on disadvantaged urban communities, and through a foundation in the Netherlands which targets individuals with no access to conventional finance. The EIF has announced that the operations being prepared will also be balanced in terms of geographical coverage. About 40% are expected to involve intermediaries investing in Europe and about 60% in Central and Eastern Europe. It is well known that microfinance is most effective if business starters and micro-enterprises are accompanied through business support services.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, the Commission will undertake measures to support European Social Fund managing authorities and intermediate bodies to step up the promotion of self-employment and micro-enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">For the current ESF programming period, the Member States have earmarked more than EUR 2.7 billion to promote entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs can also be supported through interest rebates. However, whether or not interest rebates are subsidised through the ESF is a decision to be taken by the individual Member States. At present, only one Member State, namely Lithuania, has indicated that it makes use of this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission will promote information about the Progress Microfinance Facility. The microfinance providers who are closest to the target beneficiaries will provide information on the availability of micro-loans. The Commission will make use of existing networks of public employment services, ESF managing authorities and NGOs, to provide information on the progress of the Microfinance Facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Youth on the Move campaign will pay special attention to opportunities for young people from different backgrounds to start up their own businesses and receive micro-loans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we received the report from the Commission and the European Investment Fund a few weeks ago, it talked about a total sum in the region of only EUR 200 million. One of my questions was exactly this, that the original promise or plan envisaged EUR 500 million. I am interested where these additional funds came from. I believe this is very important, as this is a high priority programme for the mitigation of the effects of the crisis, which is partly why we hurried with its adoption. The other important question was whether Member States support interest payment subsidies and training and mentoring elements from the Social Fund. This also featured in the original plan, and then the Commission seemed to neglect this issue. Supplying information, ensuring that information reaches people, is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject of microfinance is, in fact, one covered by a number of directorates general, with Mr Andor taking a certain lead as regards substance. However, it is also something that we are concerned with within the area of regional policy. Where interest rates are concerned, there are some Member States that have set a cap – as a condition, so to speak – which is at around 8 to 9.5 per cent. What must also be taken into account here, however, is that naturally – and this has always been a matter for discussion, including during the preparations for all this – the overheads are relatively high in relation to the actual loans, and therefore, costs are incurred which need to be covered. A sensible middle way has to be found, and I think we have succeeded in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the second question, I can tell you that the Jasmine instrument – which is intended to assist with the appropriate preparations for microfinance and to pave the way for intermediaries to be set up and trained – is currently being used to make ready 15 institutions in 15 different countries, 11 of them in Central and Eastern Europe and four in Western Europe. I cannot tell you all the countries off the top of my head, but essentially, they are mostly the new accession countries, and we expect that in the coming years, a further 20 intermediaries will be prepared accordingly by the Jasmine programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the last question, I must ask you to bear with me since I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer. We will forward an answer in writing, stating in detail the reasons for restricting access. I would certainly assume, however, that there are often communication problems here and that there are also often obstacles because many of the potential borrowers are people who can no longer obtain loans from a ‘conventional’ bank and there is therefore often also a certain amount of anxiety or reticence when it comes to approaching such facilities. If this is the case and it becomes ingrained and established, however, then it will be necessary to carry out information activities in this area as appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Additional support measures for SMEs under tourism policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">Tourism, like any other sector of the economy, is increasingly feeling the effects of world competition. In order for the European Union to remain competitive in this sector, the EU has set itself the objective in the Lisbon Treaty of promoting the competitiveness of tourism and creating an environment favourable to business development. For this purpose, the following objectives have been adopted: promoting innovation in tourism, improving the overall quality of tourism services and perfecting the professional skills of personnel. However, businesses in the tourism sector – many of which are SMEs – are not always able to attain these objectives through their own unaided efforts. This is due to several factors, such as limited financial resources, the lack of qualified workers and inability to respond quickly to change: hence the need for additional funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Does not the Commission consider that it would be desirable to devise a coherent strategy and a detailed action plan comprising specific support measures for SMEs and financing arrangements which could help to overcome the difficulties encountered by the sector? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio Tajani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European tourism industry, like many other economic sectors, has to face the ever greater challenge of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a challenge that the Commission has already emphasised and addressed on many occasions, in particular, with the communication ‘An industrial policy for the globalisation era’. Furthermore, on 30 June last year, the Commission adopted a specific communication on tourism, which proposes – in line with the Treaty of Lisbon and the new Europe 2020 strategy – a consolidated political framework to strengthen competitiveness in the sector, with the aim of making European tourism a truly competitive, modern, sustainable and responsible industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of an environment that is conducive to the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector is the principle on which this consolidated framework is based. To achieve this objective, we proposed three specific measures aimed, firstly, at stimulating competitiveness in the European tourism sector; secondly, at promoting the development of sustainable, responsible and high quality tourism; and thirdly, at consolidating the image and profile of Europe as a collection of sustainable and high quality tourist destinations and, of course, maximising the potential of EU financial policies and instruments for developing tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives promoted should provide the sector with the instruments necessary to adapt to the challenges faced by its operators, and to work towards its sustainable development in terms of competitiveness. Of course, specific measures will be taken to promote innovation in the tourism sector, reinforce the quality of tourism services and improve the professional skills of tourism workers, because we must no longer regard tourism as a sector consisting exclusively of family businesses; we must also consider how we can make it more modern and more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give a few examples regarding training and professional skills: an ‘ICT and tourism’ platform will be launched to facilitate the adaptation of the tourism sector and its businesses to developments in the new information technologies market and improve their competitiveness. All of these proposals and ideas are contained in the Commission communication, which has been approved by the Council and which we are debating in Parliament – the rapporteur is present in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry’s operators will be encouraged to make better use of the Union’s various programmes, such as Leonardo, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, Erasmus for young entrepreneurs, the European Social Fund and other programmes. Furthermore, a strategy to promote the diversification of tourist services and the creation of a virtual electronic observatory for European tourism will likewise help to create a favourable environment for the sector’s operators.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I must point out that small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from other cross-cutting initiatives to access funding. I would mention JEREMIE, the joint initiative of the Commission, the European Investment Fund and the European Investment Bank, which is aimed at improving access to funding for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, through the channels of risk capital, loans, securities, micro-credit and other forms of repayable aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would point out that small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector are fully covered by the measures proposed in the framework of the Small Business Act, which is intended to promote the business environment of those very same enterprises. Parliament will receive the updated text in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the Small Business Act will also become an instrument for safeguarding small and medium-sized enterprises, which offer huge potential in terms of the development of a sector that I hope to be able to strengthen over the next year, because I am absolutely convinced that a European policy, as laid down in the Treaty, can bring added value to the excellent work that is already being done by Europe’s regions and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel able to reassure the honourable Member who tabled the question that the Commission and I are committed to ensuring that all small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector are supported and assisted in their efforts to access EU economic instruments, as part of a political strategy aimed at making tourism one of our key economic and industrial policy sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To give a concrete answer, however, the central issue, aside from the policy initiatives that I have tried to implement since becoming Commissioner, is the one that Mr Fidanza raised in his speech: since the EU was not responsible for tourism policy prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the current financial perspective does not include the funds necessary for the EU to contribute to a strong tourism effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We have interesting programmes such as Calypso, which, in Spain, have been enhanced by what are, in my view, some very positive regional initiatives. However, while I clearly understood the point made by Mr Fidanza in the report that Parliament is due to submit, there will be support, because the funds earmarked for tourism policy will be increased in the next financial perspective. They may be increased in the eighth framework programme, or through the introduction of ad hoc budget lines. The important thing, however, is that Parliament brings the problem to light, because it is difficult to give concrete answers if the economic instruments are not in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, that does not mean that we will not act with great determination. As you know, countless initiatives have been taken, the Belgian Presidency organised a major event in Malta, and the Hungarian Presidency has already announced that it will organise a major event specifically devoted to tourism – this was the topic of our first meeting, which was held in Budapest a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Mr Balčytis raised the issue of tourism in the Baltic region: tourism is not an issue that exclusively concerns the economies of Mediterranean countries – Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Malta. It is an extremely important resource for the whole of the European Union, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which have their own sights and their own potential to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Baltic States, I believe that one of the issues – which, incidentally, is addressed in the text that was approved on 30 June last year – is the relationship with the new emerging classes, with the new middle class in Russia. Millions upon millions of Russians plan to carry out tourist activities and, hence, wish to travel outside their country.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a problem with regard to visas. The same problem exists with regard to China, I believe. The European Commission and the tourism ministers are determined to try to resolve this problem regarding potential visitors from both Russia and China. We want to speed matters up and make it easier for them to be admitted into our countries. Moreover, the Baltic States, being closer to Russia, can reap the potential economic benefits of hosting tourists from the emerging middle class, too.</p>
<p class="contents">This is at the very heart of our work to promote tourism policies, and I am also encouraged by the fact that many ministers from the various Member States, including the United Kingdom – I met the UK’s new tourism minister a few weeks ago in London – and France, are firmly committed to supporting EU tourism policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to identify a number of gateways, because Europe must represent added value. I am delighted that Commissioner Vassiliou has sought to include in the text on sport that was adopted today the point that major sporting events, such as the forthcoming London Olympics, are a great opportunity for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we must ensure that every country in the EU can act as a gateway for tourists to enter and visit that country, but then to go and visit other European countries once they have finished.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the additional action the European Commission can take, and Parliament’s support is crucial as far as I am concerned. May I thank you now for your future efforts, including in the debate on tourism policy, but also in all the debates concerning the forthcoming budget activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Programmes and initiatives to modernise higher education</span></p>
<p class="contents">Studies have been carried out in some Member States in order to determine how higher education institutions have adapted to the new labour market requirements and what prospects graduates have of finding work once they have completed their degree course. The research has shown – regrettably – that many universities are preparing specialists for a market that is already saturated. College syllabuses do not always allow for the needs of the labour market, and those who suffer most as a result are, therefore, new graduates. The Commission’s work programme for 2011 refers to the modernisation of higher education and states that proposals might be put forward on the systems to be applied in order to assess, and bring transparency to, the activities of higher education institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, what specific programmes and model initiatives will the Commission adopt with a view to modernising higher education in Europe? Will it draw up a special strategy to modernise higher education so as to ensure that young graduates will be able to find a job as quickly as possible? How much is it willing to invest in the future in programmes and initiatives of this kind for young people? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Androulla Vassiliou, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, education is one of the major factors that determines employability. The risk of being unemployed is 40% lower for higher education graduates than for people with only secondary education. However, youth unemployment and under-employment are unacceptably high today. Too many graduates struggle to make the transition to the labour market and secure quality employment that corresponds to their educational background.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the efforts to improve employability begin well before higher education. The Commission works with Member States to identify the skills or key competences that young people need to learn at school. Today, young people need a wider range of skills than ever before in order to flourish in a globalised economy. Many will work in jobs that do not yet exist. Many will need advanced linguistic, intercultural and entrepreneurial skills. Technology will continue to change the world in ways we cannot imagine, so the ability to continue to learn and to innovate will become crucial factors for employability.</p>
<p class="contents">Guidance is also critical. Young people are confronted with an increased number of educational choices. They need to be able to take informed decisions. This requires better information about education and training paths, including a clear picture of job opportunities. We need to develop quality career guidance services and vocational orientation with the strong involvement of labour market institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to higher education, the Commission recently launched, as you know, Youth on the Move – a Europe 2020 flagship initiative which sets out to make education and training more relevant to young people’s needs. We are now starting to implement the various parts of this strategy. Later this year, the Commission plans to present a new Communication on the modernisation of higher education. We will take stock of progress in making higher education more relevant to the needs of the knowledge-based society, including the question of employability. We will identify the key challenges for the future and set out our response.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of these efforts, the Commission will reinforce the European platform for dialogue between universities and business, with a view to increasing the employability of students and to developing the role of education in the knowledge triangle. In a more global and mobile world, transparency regarding the performance of higher education institutions can stimulate both competition and cooperation, and be an incentive for further improvements and modernisation. However, existing international rankings can give an incomplete picture of the performance of universities. This year, the Commission will present the results of a feasibility study to develop an alternative multi-dimensional ranking system which reflects the diversity of higher education institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to be better at anticipating the skill needs of tomorrow. This is why the Commission has launched the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs, which goes hand in hand with our Youth on the Move initiative. The Agenda for New Skills and Jobs looks at how to help our young people to become more employable. Above all, we need to give people the right mix of skills so that they can adapt to our fast-changing society. Our new EU Skills Panorama, which will be operational in 2012, will help to forecast not only the skills that employers need today, but also those required in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spring of this year, the Commission intends to propose new European benchmarks on learning mobility and on the role of education in preparing people to be employable in the knowledge-based labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, EU programmes to support education, training and youth, including mobility programmes such as Erasmus, can help young people to improve their chances in the labour market by gaining valuable international experience and by developing their intellectual understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the Member States, there are many differences between higher education systems, the costs of higher education and the provision of loans to pay for studies. High interest on loans taken out to pay for studies and unfavourable loan repayment conditions often deter young people from pursuing higher education in their own country and encourage a brain drain to other countries.

That is why we want to have transparency in the records of universities. That is why we are now completing the feasibility study on the basis of which we shall dare to look into the ranking of universities, the mapping of universities and the standards of universities in order to give students more informed choices. The aim is for them to know exactly where to study, what to study and what is the standard of the university that they want to enter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding fees, I think I agree with you that high fees need fair loans, but as I am sure you know, this is the responsibility of the Member States. We know that one thing that economists agree on is that investment in education is something which will produce long-term results, growth and jobs, so I always urge governments not to cut university investment or education investment in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I agree with the honourable Member who raised the question of the insufficiency of mobility grants like Erasmus. That is why we are again completing a feasibility study – a study by the London School of Economics, which I hope will be ready in a couple of months – on the basis of which we shall explore, with the European Investment Bank, the possibility of creating a European student loan for mobility. This, I am sure, will give all students, whether they are poor or rich, the possibility of taking advantage of these excellent mobility grants.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Papanikolaou’s question, he is talking about the structural development funds on the basis of which governments can build their education infrastructure. Unfortunately, the Structural Funds are not my responsibility, but I will find out from Commissioner Hahn whether there are any reports by Member States as to the outcome of these grants and if so, I will certainly let you know. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Performance of pupils in EU Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, the recently published results of the international survey of the performance of 15-year-old school pupils (PISA Survey 2009) show that the EU’s competitiveness is seriously threatened, because in the field of reading competence (Levels 5-6), only two EU countries are ranked in the top 10. In the field of mathematics, only three EU countries figure in the top 10, and none are in the top five. In 2020, both these young people and their younger fellow pupils will either be active on the labour market or be in the process of entering it, and it is therefore necessary to take immediate effective measures in the Member States if we wish to significantly improve the quality of pupils’ education.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission make a thorough assessment of the above survey and submit specific recommendations to the Member States for procedures of proven effectiveness? Are there plans for compiling a programme to disseminate such tried and tested procedures or to establish a forum to debate the challenges which need to be faced?

This is in accordance with Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Nevertheless, the Commission works with Member States to foster mutual learning and exchanges of good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As we stated in the Europe 2020 strategy, it is vital for Europe’s future as a knowledge-based and inclusive society that education systems are reformed and modernised to match the best in the world. The OECD’s PISA survey is an important resource for these exchanges. The latest PISA survey, published in December 2010, shows a mixed picture for EU Member States. There are signs of considerable improvement in some systems but, overall, there is much progress still to be made. These results will provide an important input to future exchanges between the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European benchmark, adopted by the Council in May 2009, aims at an adequate level of basic skills in reading, mathematics and science by calling for the share of low achievers aged 15 to be reduced to below 15% by the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to read something from the PISA report, which is very relevant. The share of low achieving pupils in reading, which had increased from 21% in 2000 to 24% in 2006, improved to 20% in 2009. Nevertheless, the OECD 2010 benchmark of reducing the 2000 share by 20% to reach 17% was not reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The share of low achieving pupils in maths and science has been declining since 2006. There was more progress in science than in maths and the share of low achievers is today lower in science than in maths.</p>
<p class="contents">If 2006 is used as a strong starting point, the EU is well on track as regards progress towards the 2020 low achiever benchmark. On average, over the three disciplines in the 25 EU countries for which data is available, 22.5% were low achievers in 2006 and, by 2009, their share had declined to 19.6%. So we see that, on average, in the European Union we have made progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will, of course, analyse the PISA results and publish its conclusions in its next annual progress report on benchmarks in 2011. In November 2010, the Council invited the Commission and Member States to focus their joint work on the following areas: curriculum design, motivation for reading, literacy, maths, science and technology, the impact of new technologies on basic skills and their use in helping learners to acquire autonomy and maintain motivation, gender differences in performance and attitudes, the link between pupils’ background and their mastery of basic skills and, finally, issues around teachers and teacher trainers as well as around schools’ ethos and characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusion, the Council also invited the Commission to establish a high-level group on literacy and a thematic working group on maths, science and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to launch the high-level group on literacy on 1 February. It will suggest policy measures based on best practices and research, which will help Member States to improve the consistency and effectiveness of the provision of basic skills within their lifelong learning strategies, and the group will conclude its work and publish its report in mid-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the thematic working group on maths, science and technology has already been established. It comprises national policy makers and experts on the basis of mutual learning and the exchange of good practices. The thematic working group will identify and disseminate policy measures to improve the situation of low achievers in basic skills at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also underline that the Comenius actions of the lifelong learning programme focuses, among other priorities, on increasing motivation in science and mathematics and on improving literacy skills. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Commission Communication on a Digital Agenda for Europe, Europe is still a patchwork of national online markets, and Europeans are prevented from enjoying the benefits of a digital single market by solvable problems such as the lack of investment in networks. As a result, the education provided in many remote – in particular, mountainous and island – regions lags behind technologically and investments in specific geographical locations are also affected. Will the Commission say:</p>
<p class="contents">Since ICT accounts for 5% of European GDP, having a market value of € 660 billion annually, while making a much greater contribution to increasing total productivity (20% directly from the ICT sector and 30% from ICT investments), how does it intend to address the fragmentation of digital markets?</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission is aware that without strong public intervention, there is a risk of sub-optimal roll-out with fast proven networks concentrated in high-density zones and with remote and rural areas lagging behind. That would also have negative consequences on educational systems and integration of information and communication technology in education. The latest EU-wide data shows that only 67% of schools have broadband access and that there were large disparities between Member States and between densely and thinly populated areas, 73.7% and 60.6% respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid the risk of a sub-optimal roll-out, the Commission has adopted a broadband package outlining a common framework within both national and regional policies, which should be developed to meet the targets. Those policies should, in particular, lower the cost of broadband deployment in the entire EU territory by ensuring proper planning and coordination and reducing administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already acted to increase investment in remote areas and regions within the framework of the EU Cohesion Policy with the programming of about EUR 2.3 billion in the period 2007-2013. The Commission’s communication on a European economic recovery plan also enabled the programming of EUR 360 million in broadband measures for rural areas through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. In its programme package, the Commission announced that it will reinforce and rationalise the funding of high-speed broadband through EU instruments by 2014 and explore how to attract capital for broadband investment through credit enhancement backed by the European Investment Bank and the EU funds. An EC-EIB proposal on the issue is expected in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Another pillar from the digital agenda is dedicated to digital skills. Here we propose, for instance, to consider digital literacy and competences as a priority for the European Social Fund regulation in the next programming period and to identify digital competences as a supplement to Europass to ensure their transparency. Education, as you are aware, is crucial to the development of digital competences in our society and we agree that without appropriate investment, some regions may lag behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest EU-wide data – I am talking about 2006 – shows that only 67% of schools had broadband access and that there were large disparities between EU Member States and between densely and thinly populated areas. We are about to launch a new survey on schools and the results will be available at the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that respect, the revised telecom rules – and, in particular, I refer to Article 27a of the Universal Service Directive – require Member States to make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to the service operating a hotline to report cases of missing children. In that respect, the Commission is carefully monitoring and assisting Member States in the transposition of that new provision into national law, which has to be completed by 25 May 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 November last year, the Commission adopted the Communication entitled ‘Dial 116 000: The European hotline for missing children’. The objectives of the Communication are to renew the Commission’s call on the Member States to implement the missing children hotline as a matter of priority and to ensure that the same high quality of service is offered throughout the Union to provide practical support to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communication highlights existing best practice developed by the Member States to address the main problems linked to the operating cost and telecom cost of the 116 000 hotline. The Commission proposes using this best practice to work out a set of common minimum standards that would guarantee a high quality service throughout the EU so that parents and children can count on the same assistance no matter where they are. This extensive work goes beyond electronic communications issues for which I am responsible and is coordinated by my colleague, Mrs Reding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite a difficult financial context, advances are being made on the Brenner Base Tunnel and its northern and southern access routes. This project is of the highest priority, and the Commission decided to allocate to it a budget of almost EUR 1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on the Brenner Base Tunnel itself, the meeting of the Austrian-Italian Intergovernmental Commission on 19 November 2010, in the presence of EU coordinator Pat Cox, led to decisive progress. Austria and Italy confirmed an agreement on the total cost of the Brenner Base Tunnel project at EUR 8 billion. Austria approved an optimised working plan which will allow preparatory works on the main tunnel to start by 2011. The Italian Government authorised the launch of the works with a commitment that guarantees coverage of the costs over the entire construction period.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, good progress can be reported on access route approaches on either side. Italy has authorised the launch of works on the southern access route, starting with the first section, Fortezza-Ponte Gardena. Good progress has also been made by Austria on the northern access route. Austria has a section in the Lower Inn Valley which will be completed by 2013 or even sooner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the cross-border connections between Austria and Germany, the initial goal for completing the works by 2012 at the latest will not be achieved. On the German side, works will not start before 2012 and will take an estimated three years. However, in November 2010, Germany published its national investment assessment, which includes provision for positive development on the northern access route between Munich and the Austrian border. The one-track section will be upgraded and the whole section will be electrified. The next step will be a memorandum of understanding between Germany and Austria on this section and the infrastructure management planning process will have to start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All Member States have legislation which, at least implicitly, prohibits texting, e-mailing and web browsing while driving.

I can tell you that, in my own country, the annual death toll at the beginning of the 1990s was 400, whereas last year it was 78 – and that is, of course, with a tenfold increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.

<p class="contents">However, while everybody criticises the fact that we have too much EU legislation, in my view, this is an issue about which Member States are as worried as the European public in general, and if cross-border enforcement of traffic violations can create a European space for road safety, that is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A year ago, we witnessed in Haiti one of the worst natural catastrophes in recent history, but this also triggered one of the best displays of solidarity, with people whose resilience in the face of disaster and disorder is a lesson of courage to us all. One year after the disaster, we would like to pay tribute to those who died, but also to those who have survived. We promised them our help, and we stand by our promises.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is a critical part of the global solidarity effort for Haiti. We have mobilised all the means available to provide both humanitarian assistance and, as Commissioner Piebalgs will outline later, development aid to rebuild the country.</p>
<p class="contents">After the earthquake, the EU pledged more than EUR 320 million in pure humanitarian aid, of which the Commission provided EUR 130 million for last year, 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">These funds allowed us to touch the lives of more than four million Haitians through food assistance, sanitation and shelter. Close to 1.5 million people have been provided with a place to stay: a basis from which to re-start their life. Our assistance targeted not only Port-au-Prince but also other affected cities – Léogâne and Jacmel – and we followed, with aid, the 500 000 Haitians who left Port-au-Prince to live with relatives in rural areas, bringing food, water and medical care, clearing the roads and supporting cash-for-work programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our current humanitarian assistance is focusing on cholera, using EUR 22 million to cover the most essential needs in terms of healthcare, access to proper water supplies and sanitation, information campaigns, epidemiological surveillance and logistics. We have funded treatment for 158 000 people so far but, more significantly, we have provided clean water for half a million and access to safer sanitation for 900 000 people, we have raised awareness among one million Haitians about what cholera is, how to avoid getting sick and how to treat cholera, and we have distributed 1.3 million soaps and chlorine tablets to affected communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We had hoped that one year after the earthquake, the situation would be better, but it is not. For this reason, we are budgeting for this year, 2011, EUR 33 million. We stand ready to provide more if more help is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2011, our priorities will be housing, sanitation and healthcare. We will continue to tackle poor sanitation because it is obviously a risk in terms of cholera spreading and affecting communities. We will also continue to assist with healthcare, but the healthcare system of Haiti is a shambles. It is not there to help people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process, we have relied on humanitarian aid workers and I want to express my gratitude to those who have been risking their lives to help the Haitian people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also supporting Commissioner Piebalgs in linking relief to rehabilitation and development. For instance, some of the 9th EDF ‘B’ envelope funds will be allocated for housing programmes in close coordination with our humanitarian support. I want to stress here that we have been looking at the situation in Haiti comprehensively with a view not only to helping people in immediate need but also to building the foundation for longer-term recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, we are also delivering on the reconstruction front. The EU as a whole – that is, the Union and the Member States – has already committed EUR 600 million out of its EUR 1.2 billion pledge in New York, and has already disbursed EUR 330 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the overall EU commitment, the Union’s pledge was initially announced at EUR 460 million, and we consider it necessary to increase that to EUR 522 million. Out of this pledge, we have already committed EUR 327 million. Ongoing programmes were adjusted, by extending their duration and/or by increasing the financial envelopes, to respond better to revised priorities. New programmes were put in place to address additional needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Disbursements strictly linked to the pledge amounted to EUR 74 million in 2010. I believe that, given the situation in Haiti, this is quite a good result. One has to realise that the situation there, which was already very difficult before the earthquake, became immensely challenging in its aftermath and even more complicated later – due to Hurricane Tomas, the cholera epidemic and political instability. Aid workers and technical experts were often working in quite difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Other factors which we need to bear in mind include, firstly, the fact that medium-term to long-term reconstruction assistance is implemented over three to five years and disbursements are spread over the programme’s duration: 2010 was mainly dedicated to committing funds and launching project preparations, including all necessary technical studies and tenders. More concrete activities will be starting in 2011 and we believe that disbursements against the pledge will double to EUR 150 million during this year.</p>
<p class="contents">EU development aid so far has focused, first of all, on providing necessary functions for the government to help deliver the basic services of the state, such as the running of the education system, the healthcare system and the police, and the ability to provide staff in the public sector. The second priority has been immediate reinforcement and reconstruction of strategic infrastructure and roads; and the third priority has been strengthening Haitian disaster preparedness and civil protection mechanisms and structures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set ourselves the goal of rebuilding a stronger Haiti, following the earthquake, on more solid foundations. It is very clear that we need a strong Haitian Government and we need to focus on priorities. So we very much follow the priorities identified for us by the Haitian Government. They would really like to strengthen governance – with a particular focus that includes budget support, and taking into account the limited level of government revenue – and to invest substantially in infrastructure, particularly in roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Where can we learn lessons in order to improve the situation? Well, we could coordinate the aid better and strengthen cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. We are now finalising the joint programme in a process that involves the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have good experience of working with all our partners in the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, and this definitely helps to speed up the process. I believe, however, that we must pursue our strong wish to achieve stability in terms of both aid and the democratic functioning of Haiti, because that is clearly a precondition if the efforts of the EU and the entire international community are to be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we are trying to do our best, but it is clear that we can work better. We have learned from our experiences: the EU is definitely living up to its pledge and to our commitment. So I believe that, while the situation as sometimes portrayed in the media is quite accurate from one perspective, we are advancing. I believe that in 2011, we will see significant changes on the ground – provided that political stability is established in Haiti, because instability is definitely hampering our efforts – and we will focus those efforts on rebuilding Haiti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is attributable to the structural deficiencies of the Haitian State, to the Haitian authorities’ lack of political will and decision making capability, and to a lack of support from the international community. Unless the Haitian authorities take some major decisions, such as compulsory purchase, the thousands of tons of rubble blocking the reconstruction process will not be cleared.</p>
<p class="contents">I must commend the efforts made and the work carried out by the humanitarian organisations. Progress has been achieved and millions of lives have been saved.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian agencies, however, cannot continue to compensate for the weaknesses of the Haitian State. The European Union, therefore, must do its utmost to give strong support to a fair and transparent electoral process in order to ensure the stability and political will required for reconstruction. It is imperative to assist the future Haitian authorities, throughout the reconstruction process, in the organisation of their institutions with a view to establishing a new equilibrium at all levels and a fully functioning democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is essential for the European Commission, as a member of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission and, in view of its financial contribution, to intervene with a view to speeding up the implementation of the latter’s mandate and to making provision for its operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the earthquake, the international community decided to reconstruct Haiti differently, without repeating the errors of the past. It is time to tackle the deep-rooted causes of poverty in Haiti once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the efforts to rebuild the state seem, judging by the setbacks in recent months, to have reached deadlock. This country, which has been devastated by an earthquake and hit by a cholera epidemic whose origins have been attributed to the UN Blue Helmets, has also been plunged into a serious political crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are three areas in the Haiti crisis where we need to take action in the period ahead. Otherwise, the efforts made so far risk being compromised. The results of the investigation into the causes of the cholera epidemic need to be announced as soon as possible to appease the rage of the population against the UN’s presence. Secondly, every effort must be made to avoid extending the interim period, which will be triggered at the end of President Préval’s term of office on 7 February. New elections under close international supervision are the only viable, democratic solution. Last but not least, I believe that this current assessment must mark a turning point in the reconstruction efforts, which have been undermined by inefficiency, delays and conflicting interests among countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that of the USD 10 billion promised at the Donors’ Conference in New York in March 2010, only USD 1.2 billion has been paid so far, with the European Union’s contribution accounting for a significant proportion of this. On top of our concerns about resolving the problems of the million Haitians surviving in emergency camps where poverty, despair and sexual violence are assuming alarming proportions, we must add the long-term prospect of sustainable investments in Haiti and concrete support for building a viable state structure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, one year after the earthquake, Haiti is still mostly in ruins. In view of the scale of the catastrophe, we knew that the country would face considerable difficulties. We also knew that, in addition to the many civilian victims, the earthquake had affected the very heart of the State, so significant was the damage caused by this natural catastrophe. When we add to that the structural difficulties and, in particular, the shortcomings in terms of governance, the challenges faced by those working on the ground are obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is primarily responsible for this situation? Even if there are extenuating circumstances, the main player is the Haitian State itself, without which nothing can be done. The alternative would be to take over control of the country, and no one wants that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can complement action by the Haitian State and indeed, we have to do so. In any case, the European Union has spared no efforts in this respect. The European Union has not only made statements, but it has also acted upon them. What we expect of the European Union in future is that, of course, it continues to give its unfailing support but, above all, it is important to contribute towards enabling Haiti to free itself from this dependency, despite its acknowledged weakness. I recognise that that cannot happen in a few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Haiti is a failing state. Can we really speak of reconstruction, given the fact that Haiti was never a democracy to begin with? That is the task that we see before us. Despite all the efforts the Commission has made, we simply have no answer to that question yet. The outbreak of cholera, the vote-rigging in the November elections and the intimidation of people are, of course, of no help to us in reconstructing this country, as it were. The fact that women and girls were already in a terrible position before the earthquake has led to our continuing reluctance to accept that women and girls in reception camps are being subjected to sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that comes the fact that Baby Doc is back in Haiti and that he might be wanting to trade on the misery which the citizens are currently in, because – rumour has it – his money has finally run out. We cannot allow this to happen in Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">Our response over the past year since the disaster has been to enable the Haitians to try to rebuild, but what they really lack is organisational capacity. That is why they are still stuck with emergency aid and we have to move towards development cooperation. There is a link missing somewhere. Now, while this is not something that can just happen overnight, it <span class="italic">is</span> one place where we should be directing our efforts, because this country will not be able to put buildings up without being a democracy or, at least, having a proper leadership. I therefore wish Commissioners Georgieva and Piebalgs all the best in this endeavour. I wish you all the best! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows our concern for the people of Haiti – we are obviously more concerned about the people of Haiti than the government of Haiti is concerned about the people of Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about the responsibility to protect. We talk about responsibility to protect against mass murderers and genocidal dictators – but what about the responsibility to protect against inefficient and corrupt governments who do not care about their own people? There are a million people homeless in Haiti; 230 000 have died; 300 000 are injured. But only 5% of the rubble has been cleared, only 15% of houses have been reconstructed in some fashion or other.</p>
<p class="contents">If the government of Haiti does not care about its own people, then we have to use the concept of responsibility to protect. Until and unless we do that, it is quite absurd for us to ask our two excellent Commissioners to go on popping up and down in Parliament trying to tell us what they can and cannot do, when the local capacity to do anything is so fraught and fragile.</p>
<p class="contents">When an earthquake happens, the first thing you need to do is to clear the rubble. In order to clear the rubble, you need heavy lifting machinery, cranes, helicopters, bulldozers and the capacity to drive them. If there is nobody capable of driving this machinery, then you have to bring people in from somewhere else who know how to drive them and get them to be driven. But the left wing would oppose any Member State army or air force or navy coming and helping to do that. You cannot expect people from Oxfam and Save the Children and other such organisations to be driving tractors and lifting heavy rubble. We have to depoliticise our argument and be practical about helping these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everywhere, there was devastation and death.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us pay tribute to the courage of the Haitian people and the worldwide surge of popular solidarity towards the victims. I say popular solidarity because, in Europe, as elsewhere, it is very often those who have little who give the most.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like here also to formally thank the Cuban State and people for their help in providing effective support, without any ulterior motive and with results that speak for themselves. To date, the Cuban medical brigade has treated more than 50 000 cholera cases, enabled 76 health centres and hospitals to be rebuilt and operated on many Haitians. Cuba’s aid is considered by many experts to be particularly effective. So true is this, that a country like Norway wanted to ask Cuba to intervene on its behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the United States would do well to draw inspiration from the Cuban example rather than to feel complacent behind media performances that ill disguise their perception of aid as charity when, in fact, above all, it serves their own economic and political interests at the expense of sustainable reconstruction of the Haitian State and its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Given their historic responsibility for Haiti’s misfortunes, it is obscene for France and the United States to pretend to know what is best. Let us remember that it took the very worst of catastrophes for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to decide at last to cancel Haiti’s debt.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, what is happening in Haiti demonstrates limitations in the current operation of the United Nations (UN). In Haiti, humanitarian interference demonstrates its inability to implement sustainable solutions for people. What is worse is that, in the medium and long term, it constitutes a hindrance to the reconstruction of a democratic State and of an economy that ultimately responds to the Haitian people’s human need for development.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has promised USD 11.5 billion for the country’s reconstruction. It remains to be seen what is meant by reconstruction. How much of this aid has actually arrived in the field? Who will decide on the projects? Are we going to see, as happened in Kosovo, people who have been made redundant watching big multinational companies reconstructing their country because they are the only ones able to win the international tenders?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must not be part of a paternalistic or neocolonialist vision but instead must contribute to the rise of a democratic renaissance in the Haitian Republic that is the work of the people themselves. The Haitian people were the first in the world to free themselves from French colonialism. In addition to the ravages of the war, that cost them more than EUR 20 billion in today’s money in ‘compensation’ to the slaveholding European colonists.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the crimes against humanity, which slavery and colonialism represent, the European Union and France, in particular, now owe a moral, political and economic debt to Haiti. We must honour this debt of honour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, progress has been made, step by step. The people of Haiti badly need our help, especially now that the cholera epidemic is taking its toll. We should focus on food security. Local agriculture has been hard hit, as a result of which the country has become too dependent on food imports. It is important that a great deal of energy and money are invested in redeveloping agriculture and local infrastructure. In that respect, micro-loans are of the utmost importance, as they stimulate economic development from the bottom up. Does the Commission share this view?</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the political situation in Haiti remains alarming, following the first round of presidential elections. The evaluation report issued by the Organization of American States last week makes that clear. How does the Commission assess the current political situation in Haiti and the impact it has had on the reconstruction of the country?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, last week, an impressive book about Haiti by a Dutch journalist was published and one image has stuck in my memory ever since: some people in Haiti clearing the debris after the earthquake wore T-shirts with the slogan ‘Haiti pap peri’ (Haiti is NOT dying). That should inspire us to ensure that the Haitians do, indeed, survive and that, thanks to our support, they are given good prospects for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are still the largest source of humanitarian aid. However, it is depressing that the country is still mired in domestic and political chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of humanitarian aid to Haiti was carried out in two classic stages. The first stage was to provide emergency aid and was supposed to target those who were most in need. The second stage was to focus on the economic, social and political reconstruction of the country. However, due to the outbreak of cholera, the hurricane, the unstable social and political situation, and even interreligious tensions and strife, the stage of providing humanitarian aid is taking longer than we originally expected. As a result, we cannot progress to the second stage as rapidly or as comprehensively as we would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Haiti is ongoing. Our involvement is still needed. We cannot abandon our responsibilities. As Mr Piebalgs reminded us, the European Commission has provided half the resources which were promised at the Donors’ Conference in New York. In this regard, our plans are progressing well.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the resolution which this Parliament will adopt tomorrow is to mobilise Member States and the Commission to implement the declarations we have made. Let us remember that hundreds of thousands of people are still living in temporary camps, and over 3.5 thousand people have died of cholera. From the very beginning, we have maintained that those responsible for reconstruction should be the people of Haiti themselves. The Haitian plan for the reconstruction of the country is based on decentralisation and an emphasis on local agriculture and food security. We respect these priorities of the people of Haiti. There is one other recommendation. We should increase our humanitarian efforts and I know that the Commissioner is already working on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all need to understand that. This is not a humanitarian crisis where we pay some money and then the government decides how to implement the projects. Haiti is a country in complete collapse. The only thing we can expect is that, given the situation it is in, this country will have more corruption and will find it more and more difficult to deal with the crisis and take the necessary measures. It is a country in which our intervention needs to be more forceful, more stable; we shall often need to have a more active role than in any other case.</p>

There is so much work that needs to be done in this country that normally, if all this is done properly, there should be no unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must intervene proactively in the question of the debris, in the question of the water supply and in the question of the food supply, so that this country can stand on its own feet, so that the citizens of this country, who are forced on a daily basis to consider how they are to survive, can also think about the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Instead of saying one year <span class="italic">after</span> the earthquake, we should actually be saying one year <span class="italic">of</span> earthquakes, because there was the seismic earthquake, then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution, then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak, then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time, and now the earthquake that is, in some respects, historical too, with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is doing good work – very good work, in fact. I visited Haiti last June with the Committee on Development and I saw the excellent work being done, for which we thank the Commission. However, there needs to be greater political protection and an enhanced role for the international community, which must set targets and deadlines and must directly oversee part of the reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be balanced with the increased involvement of the population and local NGOs, which are often frozen out instead.

Now we have to look beyond these emergencies to finally reach the development stage. We do not have to reconstruct but rather to construct a country whose foundations and governance have never been strong.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear, as my fellow Members have said: there are 20 million tonnes of rubble to clear and only 5%, a minute part, has been cleared in a year. At this rate, it will take more than six years to clear the ruins in Port-au-Prince. It is therefore a political project in itself and the Commission has to contribute to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority is governance and I am pleased that the European Union is making a major contribution to budgetary support for the country. We have to increase this financial effort because it is the only means of restoring competences to the Haitian country and people. Its current dependency on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) is seen at the level of basic public services such as health and education. We must not, however, subcontract all public services to NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we have to increase our support to organise elections quickly and complete these elections, which, I hope, should enable a corrupt political elite to be replaced. At present, an oligarchy of allegedly 20 families prevents any economic development because it controls trade but, at the same time, does nothing to develop the country’s production capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake. Therefore, I call upon European institutions to establish consistent priorities and to give massive support to setting up public services with strong commitment from the future Haitian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have heard some very fine things said here tonight, but these are not going to be possible on the ground unless there is more help.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put more pressure on those who promised their support to deliver that support, and we must put pressure on the Clinton-led reconstruction, and the United Nations, to move faster. That has got to come very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to the Commissioner and he is quite right. We do need political stability. I hope and I pray that we get that political stability, but I am not so sure that we will.</p>
<p class="contents">I found when we were there – and I want to say this and put it on the record – that the Haitian people are a very proud people. They are a wonderful people. We watched them, Michèle Rivasi and I, coming out of their tents at 6 o’clock in the morning shining like a shilling and with their children washed. Wonderful people smiling and you wondered why they were able to smile.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to put on record a tribute to the many people there from our NGOs who are risking their lives, and to our Commission staff to whom I paid tribute when we were there.

At present, one year after this awful earthquake, the country is still awaiting reconstruction. In the meantime, its troubles have been added to by the cholera epidemic and elections, all of which has complicated the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, Port-au-Prince is a vast refugee camp at the moment. The Haitian population is only surviving thanks to the humanitarian organisations’ efforts. Indeed, we must be grateful to these organisations. As the UN Special Representative for this country stated, Haiti has become a republic of NGOs. However, how long can this situation last? We can see that the health situation is disastrous, the reconstruction of the education system is an absolute must, not to mention the process of getting rid of the traces of the disaster. All this creates the need to rebuild the Haitian state. Apart from the earthquake, the absence of institutions and good governance is a huge problem at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, efforts must be focused on restoring the capacity of the state and on building democracy in Haiti. The need must be spelt out in very strong terms for a credible, transparent electoral process with the prospect of the second round of the elections in February.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I would like to make is that Haiti must be rebuilt, if you permit me to say so, differently. By ‘differently’, I mean that reconstruction must be of better quality than before to prevent the recurrence of similar disasters. By ‘differently’, I also mean that our efforts to rebuild the country must involve, I would say, the local communities. I believe that the main stakeholders, the Haitian people, must be consulted during this reconstruction process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once we have solved this problem, we will have to tackle the problem of housing, urgently resolving the issue of land titles.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we need a legitimate, democratically elected government that is capable of negotiating. I know that the situation is not easy, but we need that legitimate discussion in order to speed up the improvement of the situation in Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another significant problem that has already been mentioned by several of my fellow Members: rubble, which is a major political problem in itself. We should also not stop looking to the future in order to begin establishing a long-term education strategy. What happened in Haiti would probably not have happened if there had been a public education system and if children were looked after as they should have been.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to bring an end, not only to poverty, but also to dependence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An operation to provide aid and to help in reconstruction has been going on for a year. This is, without doubt, a huge and very complex humanitarian operation. However, the island does not only require material and financial aid, but also the reconstruction of its administrative agencies and political stability, without which it cannot develop. In addition, the recent cholera epidemic which has already killed over 3 500 people is still putting thousands of people at risk. Haiti’s experience shows that even generous amounts of money will not help if they are not targeted correctly. The case of Haiti should give us food for thought, and it clearly indicates the need to create an efficient system of international aid for any possible natural disasters in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think of the humanitarian organisations who have done an incredible amount of work. President, that is the upside of the story. We have to learn lessons and, as far as I am concerned, there are three lessons we need to learn here.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, coordination. Coordination in the humanitarian aid stage was not a great success, and today we have received a report on that issue. We need to be better at reconstruction. That also makes me think of the effectiveness of aid, because that is also related to coordination. What additional and more effective action can be taken there?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about corruption. If we want the citizens of Europe to provide support, then they will not want that support to be used inappropriately. We do not want to see that, either as representatives of the authorities or as ordinary citizens. What can we do, through better coordination, to ensure that corruption does not take hold over these systems?</p>
<p class="contents">My third point, Madam President, is the political aspect. Without political stability and a very decisive public administration, that sustainable construction will be unable to progress at all. We have had the first round of elections, which remain a matter of dispute. I would like to ask you this: what progress are we making, in terms of the coordination with the Organization of American States and other actors, in ensuring that the forthcoming elections go well? As Europeans, we have expressed our commitment to help Haiti in the short term and I think we have to continue to show solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The international community promised a great deal but has delivered very little and it is hard to understand why the reconstruction process is so slow, in spite of the goodwill of the European Union and the work of non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has become worse because of the cholera outbreak and the political instability following elections that led to enormous violence, of which women and children were the main victims. The European Union must continue to help with the reconstruction and to improve the humanitarian situation of vulnerable groups within the Haitian population, but must also contribute to reinforcing capacities for disaster prevention in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to welcome the recent proposals tabled by the Commission regarding the creation of a European disaster response that includes establishing a voluntary pool of Member States’ emergency organisations and developing contingency plans, as well as the merging of humanitarian aid crisis centres with civil protection to form a European emergency response centre, responsible for monitoring dangerous situations, issuing early warnings and coordinating EU disaster response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, therefore, we are conducting what constitutes a review and there is one obvious conclusion: it is a year since the tragedy and the number of victims is still growing. Two equally important issues should be stressed at this point, which are more important than the construction of new houses and new roads. Firstly, this Parliament must make a loud and clear appeal for an immediate end to the epidemic of sexual assaults. As our sources show, 250 women and girls had been raped only a few days after the earthquake, and the situation is still getting worse. Violence of this nature is on the increase. It is about time we discussed this shameful subject, addressed this inhumane phenomenon, and began to effectively counteract sexual assault in Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the cholera epidemic, which has already been mentioned here. The number of those infected has decreased, but this is, of course, dependent on the time of year. There is a link with a strange but disturbing trend where patients are pretending to have cholera. It is difficult for us to believe this, as we will be going back to our comfortable beds tonight, but for these people, a night in hospital is a much better prospect than one in their own homes, which are nothing more than crude shelters. And we should also bear in mind that the cholera epidemic is sure to increase with a change in the season. This is why we must take notice, and why we should improve these circumstances in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it is important that we continue the good work in cooperation with the UN and the NGOs etc. I know that one of our most successful Irish businessmen, Denis O’Brien, is playing a leading role in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all that will be a drop in the ocean compared to what could be achieved if we had a properly functioning government. So the message has to go out loud and clear to the Haitian Government that it either needs to ‘catch itself on’ or – hopefully – to be removed by a more competent government, and then we would see real progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More aid is urgently needed; more aid to the populations hit by the tragedy of a year ago and the recent outbreaks of disease. It is unacceptable that some aid has still failed to arrived. The aid already approved must be followed up, specifically by the European Union. Moreover, the EU should pay the exemplary acts of solidarity by some countries in the region the attention they are due. I would stress the case of Cuba, whose government sent doctors and specialised personnel who have already treated more than 50 000 people for cholera. However, I would also highlight the support of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America in terms of financing as well as of energy, agriculture and food.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be positive if the European Union were to take this into account and play a more active role. All the measures required to accelerate Haiti’s rapid reconstruction and improve its population’s living conditions need to be taken urgently, but we insist on respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that the bravery and nobility of the Haitian people merit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kristalina Georgieva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I sincerely thank Members of Parliament for all their comments this evening. In closing, I would like to make five points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I agree very much with all speakers who emphasised the governance failure as the most significant factor underlying the problems Haiti faces today. That was my first impression after the earthquake and it still stands today: that bad as the earthquake was, it is not Haiti’s biggest problem. Its biggest problem is the many decades of bad governance that have practically left no social structures and government structures in place to help the Haitian people, and that creates a big deficit of trust of the Haitian people in their government.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember very vividly how, when I was there, universally all the Haitians I talked to had one message for me consistently, which was ‘Do not give money to the government’. Now, on the humanitarian side, we do not give money; we provide direct assistance. But it does give us pause for thought on the question of how long it will take to rebuild Haiti: it will take a very long time because it will not happen without this institutional infrastructure in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This being said, my second point is that there is actually a positive side to Haitian society which has helped the Haitian people survive: their own resilience and the resilience of their communities. I met people who lived together: they lost their houses together, they moved to camps together and they have organised in the camps a support system for each other, with some taking responsibility to oversee the kids and to improvise some schooling for them; others taking responsibility to find work; others, actually the women, taking on responsibility for cooking for everybody. That resilience is what gives us some hope today for the future of Haiti.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads on to my third point, which is that our support programmes for Haiti have to take into account what the country has and does not have. For that reason, we have, on the humanitarian side, emphasised cash for work, voucher programmes, innovations like getting seeds and tools at the Community level so that people can actually increase their reliance on themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I am grateful for the points that were made on what lessons we have learnt from Haiti. I would not agree that we were slow to respond: help from the European Union was flowing within 24 hours. But I would agree that coordination left room for improvement and that our ability to organise ourselves before a disaster strikes is absolutely essential. In this sense, I am grateful for the point that was made that, based on lessons from Haiti, we have indeed moved in the direction of creating a European Response Capacity and stronger coordination through the European Disaster Response Centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me then move to a last point, looking forward on the humanitarian side. What is it that we are very worried about? It is actually the question of protection, especially for women, and of increasing our support for dealing with the tragedy of primarily women-led households stuck in the camps. I can assure you that this year, as well as with the funding next year, we will put the emphasis on making sure that this question of protection is addressed and that the EU is there for people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in closing, just thank everyone once again for their comments and especially those of you who have recognised the sacrifice of the humanitarian workers for the benefit of the people of Haiti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, first, I would like to thank Members of this House for their solidarity and support. I will start with the political dimension. The situation is certainly not easy in Haiti, but the High Representative is following it very closely and giving all the necessary diplomatic support to ensure that there is stability. The second round of presidential elections will help rebuild credibility if there is no violence around it, so we are also making all the necessary diplomatic efforts; but diplomatic efforts sometimes give immediate results and sometimes need time to produce results.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you mentioned Baby Doc’s visit. We can say that whilst anybody can move freely, this was definitely not the best sign of the whole political process. But we should not be somehow misled by this. I think there is a healthy political core in Haiti and we should believe in it. Our hope is that the people who are elected in the legislative elections and the president will have the necessary capacities to lead the reconstruction of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to emphasise is that development cooperation is about hard choices. One choice is do something with high visibility that does not entail a structural change. It would be no problem to finance thousands of doctors from the EU or to build a new university in the name of the EU; it would be visible and everybody would say fine. But what about the insecurity in the streets? We finance security in quite difficult conditions through the government. So, if security is provided partially, it is financed by the European Union. Is it visible? Not very much so, because there is no EU label, but I believe it is definite that we have provided for the stability of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is where to invest money. Again, rebuilding the houses would be the easiest political choice, but what help is that if the country is not reconnected, if there is no infrastructure? And infrastructure requires massive investment. Roughly speaking, one kilometre of road costs USD 1 million and in Haiti even more, because there must be maintenance, and also we need to help the local communities through which the road passes. So the costs are very substantial. Haiti will not have such funds to invest. Strangely enough, in Haiti, we are the only ones involved in the road infrastructure. Normally, many other countries participate in road infrastructure, but in Haiti, we are alone in giving grants for this. It is a difficult choice, but I believe it will help the country to have structural change.</p>
<p class="contents">A last point which was not raised very much today is the speed of commitment and disbursement of funds. The funds should not be misused and it takes time for budget support. It is not just that the government gives us an account and we just transfer the money. No. We check the account, we know where the disbursements go, so it is quite a procedure. You cannot just immediately send EUR 1.2 billion to an account and expect that everything will be sorted out. We also have a responsibility to our taxpayers. The same considerations apply with the roads: we need to launch a tender, we need to be transparent about this and that takes a bit of time. But I believe this time is rightly taken, because it needs only one case of a misuse of funds for the support for Haiti’s reconstruction to be damaged in the eyes of European citizens. I can assure you that we will take all the necessary steps in this regard, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I thank you for your support. It was a very helpful and encouraging debate and I believe that we will try to deliver on the issues that you have mentioned today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to call for evidence of this to be seen, too. I have high expectations of the response that we are to receive today because, if nothing definite happens now and Italy does not receive a severe fine for this, where necessary, we will come across this problem in many other places. It is not only Italy that has major problems with regard to waste. If everyone has the impression that nothing will happen if they only use landfill sites, we will have a very major disaster on our hands. I am therefore looking forward to the response.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use the remainder of my speaking time to address Italy. I am well aware that Italy’s government is not directly represented here, but it is nevertheless important for Italy itself to begin to acknowledge that this problem must now be resolved. It is a remarkable country and it is on the brink of drowning in waste. Many conflicts are arising and recently, the situation has only got worse. Italy must not now experience a situation in which yet more burdens are placed on the people in the form of fines. Instead, it must ensure that a plan is put in place that is credible and thus use the many active citizens as part of the solution instead of always making them targets for criminalisation, etc. We cannot solve the waste problem if we do not have the citizens behind us, and there are many citizens who are only too willing to do a great deal of good work in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Use the military and the police – not to suppress the people, not to keep local authorities out – but to get hold of the real culprits. Of course, one party that benefits from this is large-scale industry in northern Italy, which makes a nice fat profit from the fact that it can simply dispose of its waste inexpensively instead of paying what it costs. Others that benefit include the gangsters in the Mafia, who also make large profits. Therefore, this must stop now, and I hope that Italy will start to take this matter very seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we asked him why the disastrous waste situation in Campania had not yet been resolved, he said that it was a political problem.</p>
<p class="contents">That reply explains a great deal. Of course, he could have said anything – that it was a technical problem, a logistical problem or a financial one. No, the problem was political. The problem is that there is a lack of political will. It is because of this lack of political will that Italy has failed to meet its obligations under the Waste Directive. It is also because of this lack of political will that, in October, it could be observed that none of the improvements that the European Court of Justice had demanded had been implemented. Again, it is due to this lack of political will that, by the end of the year, the EU still had not received a waste sorting plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, we have seen that the authorities have had the political will to keep these scandals secret by means of security stamps. Therefore, our group takes a clear position on this matter. We support all – and there are many – of the good Italian men and women who are fighting for openness on this matter and for those responsible for this situation getting this far to be brought to account. However, we also believe that before this happens, we must completely reject any idea that European taxpayers should pay as much as a single euro more for the waste debacle in Italy. We must not throw good money after bad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, last year, we visited Campania and Naples, together with the Committee on Petitions, in order to witness the waste crisis situation for ourselves, a situation which many petitioners had described as very grave. We, too, found the situation on the ground to be very grave. We saw a waste tip in a national park on top of Mount Vesuvius. We saw many illegal dumping sites and burning piles of rubbish. I even recovered industrial waste from a mountain which had been designated as a household waste tip and we also saw an out-of-order incinerator, or at least what appeared to be one.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear: things are not working there at the moment and I agree with the previous speakers that there appears to be a great deal of political wrangling over who exactly is responsible for this situation. Actually, we have called on the politicians and citizens there to put aside all their political differences and to join hands, in order to resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since then, I have not seen any sign of a solution, nor have I seen any plan being drawn up here – at least not in public – and I hope that you will be able to clarify for us whether a plan actually exists. The people of Campania told us the following very clearly last year: ‘We have appealed to everyone for help and knocked on all manner of doors, here in our province and the region, across Italy and amongst the Italian Government, and everywhere, we came away empty-handed. The European Union is our last hope and, at a time when no one else was listening to us, the European Union came to hear what we had to say’.</p>
<p class="contents">They have pinned their hopes on you and us, in the hope that we will ultimately be able to help find a solution in their region, one way or another. Of course, they need to resolve the situation on the ground themselves. Although, unfortunately, we cannot go there to clean up the rubbish with our own hands, we have a key role to play in this. Could you clarify whether there is a plan, if so, whether it is a quality plan, and if not, what you are planning to do about it? What are the deadlines? When does it have to be implemented by and how long are you prepared to wait? When are you ultimately going to push for sanctions to be imposed by the European Court of Justice and what is happening with the structural funds which are currently still frozen?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a waste crisis; these things could also lead to situations which are hazardous to human health. Where does the European Commission stand on this? This may not be your domain, but perhaps you could tell us, anyway, whether you have begun tackling this or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the mafia, too, clearly has a hand in this. It has to be said, though, that it is neither for the European Commission nor us to do anything directly about this; the only thing we can ultimately do is monitor the implementation of our directives in the European Union. In what way could we provide further support, perhaps by sharing best practice? How can Member States help each other here? Do you not agree that, in this case, waste should be seen, not so much as a problem, but as an opportunity? Campania could make a huge leap overnight towards becoming a recycling community. I am of the opinion that we should actually advocate a total ban, at European level, on the dumping of waste and a ban on waste tips. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the face of this now paradoxical third-world situation, I would like to know from the Commission what consequences Italy will face from the point of view of European law and what financial penalties may be imposed on it if the waste crisis in Campania is not definitively resolved soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know whether the Commission can provide detailed information about the European funding that the Campania region has received up to now for the creation of the integrated waste collection and disposal system. You see, Commissioner, usually, when we talk about crises, we talk about tragic, extreme situations, but they are still resolved within a reasonable timeframe. When a so-called ‘crisis’ lasts more than 15 years, something is clearly going wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the Italian Government has tried everything possible to resolve the long-standing issue of the waste collection and disposal system. However, the fact that the streets of Naples are today swamped by tonnes and tonnes of rubbish is clearly the fault, first and foremost, of the local authorities in Campania and of their total incompetence or reluctance to work to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear – crystal clear in fact – that the conditions affecting Naples and Campania are due to the evasion of responsibility that has characterised the municipality, the province and the region for many years where waste management is concerned. Central government cannot be blamed for the fact that separate collection, the first crucial element of an effective waste management plan, has not been imposed. Central government clearly cannot be blamed for the fact that it had to send the army a few weeks ago – but also on other previous occasions – to replace hundreds of refuse collectors who suddenly fell ill at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the crisis has hit Naples while the situation is very different in the rest of Italy, for example, in my region, Veneto, where separate collection has been taking place for years without any problems and with a very high recycling rate, means that the responsibility for the crisis lies with Campanian policy making, with local government officials and, above all, with the serious collusion with the underworld, which has always sought and made huge profits from the waste business thanks to the Camorra’s infiltrating local policy making and local government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank all Members of Parliament who drew my attention and the attention of my services to this important question. I am pleased that the European Parliament has taken an active role in monitoring the waste management situation in Campania, as shown, for example, by the report adopted by the Committee on Petitions following the visit to Campania which it carried out in April last year. Parliament has truly an important role here and has assumed it fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after the European Court ruling, on 4 March 2010, the Commission wrote to the Italian authorities asking what measures they had planned or taken in order to comply with it. After that, the Commission has had several contacts and meetings with the Italian authorities, most recently during the mission to Naples carried out on 22 and 23 November 2010 by a delegation from the Environment Directorate-General.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that the Italian authorities still have a long way to go in order to execute the ruling. In particular, they need, firstly, to expand and upgrade waste management facilities throughout the whole of Campania and, secondly, to develop an effective management plan for urban waste in Campania, taking into account, amongst other things, the EU waste management hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not satisfied with the measures that the Italian authorities have communicated since the Court’s ruling because they do not include a detailed calendar indicating milestones for the construction works of the foreseen installations.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the waste management plan for Campania must be fully compliant with EU environmental law and must give priority to waste reduction, re-use and recycling; ensure implementation of separate collection in the whole region; provide Campania with the necessary composting capacity; and establish measures for the safe disposal in a reasonable timeframe of more than seven million tonnes of baled waste stored in several cities in Campania, which also means that the Italian authorities will have to carry out an analysis of the baled waste, the so-called ‘ecoball’, before deciding which is the safest way to dispose of them.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no adequate and effective waste management plan, the Commission will return to the Court and propose the imposition of fines. Therefore, we must closely assess the draft waste management plan that the Campania authorities have just submitted to the Commission – and ‘just’ really means ‘just’ – and monitor carefully that they actually adopt and implement the plan. The decision on whether and when to open Article 260 proceedings against Italy will depend mainly on the content of the waste management plan and the timing of the measures used to immediately address the problem in a convincing way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the existing landfills, the Commission has started an investigation and asked the Italian authorities to report on the functioning of the Terziano and Cicciano landfills. The Italian reply is still pending and once it is received, the Commission will assess it.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, the Commission does not have evidence of a breach of European Union environmental law. The fact that the landfill is situated in a nature protected area is not, in itself, a breach of EU legislation, provided, of course, that other rules are applied and that the competent national authorities carry out an appropriate environment assessment and implement the necessary mitigation and also compensation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the cofinancing of waste management measures in Campania, in the 1994-1999 programming period, EUR 88.1 million were devoted to waste management projects, almost 49% cofinanced by the ERDF. However, only 90% of the total allocation was used because of difficulties also linked to the waste management crisis and the institution by the Italian authorities of the extraordinary management in 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2002-2006 programming period, a total financing allocation of EUR 140 million, 50% cofinanced again by the ERDF, was concentrated on waste management projects. However, following the waste management crisis, the Commission decided to take specific measures in order to ensure that ERDF funds allocated to Campania were used properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as from 1 January 2005, expenditure management was considered ineligible for cofinancing. Secondly, after the official notification to Italy of the opening of the infringement procedure for waste management on 29 June 2007, the Commission informed the Italian authorities that no further cofinancing would be acceptable for waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2007-2013 regional operational programme in Campania foresees a total investment of EUR 270 million, again 50% cofinanced by the ERDF, for the management of waste. However, the disbursement of EC financing for projects in the waste sector is subject, in particular, to the condition that the Italian authorities adopt a regional waste management plan, to be validated, of course, by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will publish in the Commission the report on the implementation of a thematic strategy on prevention and recycling of waste. This report shows significant differences between Member States in terms of waste management performance. It clearly demonstrates that with an appropriate waste management strategy, landfilling can be reduced close to zero and that incineration could be dramatically reduced by increasing waste composting and recycling. In addition to transforming waste into resources, this creates jobs and economic activity while reducing the environmental impact of waste management. So I really hope that this crisis will eventually be transformed into an opportunity by the competent authorities through the launch of serious separate collection and recycling schemes in Campania.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, the Commission is hoping that the waste management plan for Campania is convincing. Until we are certain of an effective plan setting up a system with the necessary infrastructure and have robust guarantees that projects will be implemented effectively, Commission funding of relevant waste management projects in Campania is interrupted.</p>
<p class="contents">I will address some of your questions which you have already raised in my closing remarks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has already been said, the regional executive which, I would remind you, was formed only in May 2010, has developed a close dialogue with the European Commission in recent months, beginning a process that we can certainly regard as a departure from that of previous years. There have been no miracles, however; responsibility has simply been assumed for a drastic situation that has been consolidated over 15 years of ineffective or non-existent action. I would remind you that Italy was sentenced by the Court of Justice in March 2010, but for actions discovered and dealt with in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the situation has changed. The Alderman for the region has already travelled to Brussels three times and has already completed a good proportion of the schedule of works that was outlined in a hearing held before the Committee on Petitions in July. I shall quickly run through the list: he has approved the special waste plan; he has finalised the urban solid waste plan; and, on 31 December, he presented yet another plan with the corrections requested by the Commission, which will be approved by 30 April, as already announced.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan has already been partially implemented: the waste to energy plant in Acerra is up and running; the tender procedures for the Salerno plant have been completed; the contract for the Naples East plant has been announced; and 182 waste separation and recycling areas, 7 recovery facilities, 9 composting facilities, 4 multi-material separation facilities, 1 waste electrical and electronic equipment processing facility, 2 aerobic management facilities, 34 approved platforms and 5 landfills are now fully operational, and I am pleased that they will be overseen by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement has been concluded with the five provinces to ensure the disposal of their accumulated waste, and agreements have also been concluded with five regions to provide for the temporary relocation of their waste, until the plan has been definitively implemented. The extraordinary management process is now over, and some funds have been harnessed from the regional budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Bucella said in her recent hearing before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the deadline for complying with the judgment usually varies from 12 to 24 months, so we are well on schedule. However, the Commission can use its discretion to assess whether the deadline should be extended so that it is realistically in line with the progress of the works.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the answers to all of the questions asked have already been provided in this time and, as the Commissioner said, there are no grounds for imposing further financial penalties. The Commission is rightly being vigilant, and I hope that this debate will not be used to further work against the institutions and the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is a serious debate aimed at helping the Campania region and trying to find a solution to a long-standing problem, then surely the resolution that we expect to vote on in February can be a common resolution. If not, it will be yet another waste of time and will cause even more damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a European institution, we have a duty to intervene to ensure that this situation does not drag on too long. We must be very vigilant and keep a close eye on the local authorities, urging them without hesitation to adopt credible measures that will enable Campania to end this serious crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that we have spoken at length about the waste crisis, without knowing how things really stand. The Campania region made a commitment to present a regional plan by 2010, but it has now been postponed until March 2011. The situation will become unmanageable if there are any further delays: the risks to public health are increasing, and organised crime continues to profit from the crises.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Decree-Law No 195/2009, the Italian Government declared the crisis over and delegated responsibility for waste management to the provinces. We do not support that decision; it will be difficult to implement it in a province such as Naples, where 52% of the Campanian population live.</p>
<p class="contents">The municipalities must be placed at the heart of matters, since they alone are capable of providing targeted and effective solutions. Various Campanian trade unions have begun separate collections, investing considerable effort and obtaining significant results. They should be given the resources that have already been transferred to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to the local authorities is more important than ever: they are on the front line and have a real, comprehensive oversight of their own region. They are the ones sounding the alarm about the full landfills. In the years to come, new landfills and new incinerators will be required, and the associated sites will need to be identified. This is partly because of the exclusion of the Vitiello Quarry in Terzigno, which the local community and our Parliament requested in order to avoid the risk of the entire urban waste collection system grinding to a halt.</p>

<p class="contents">Questionable lists aside, we need to realise one thing: the people of Campania continue to live – and die – surrounded by waste. The local, regional and national politicians, on the right and on the left, have an enormous responsibility. The task of solving the problem cannot be offloaded on to the citizens, who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions. The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found, or else its intervention will have been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction of incinerators, which, by the way, are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation, will not solve the issue. The waste would be turned into ash, causing harmful and deadly emissions. Pursuant to the Waste Directive, incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned, I feel it should be acknowledged that, while Mafia infiltration, particularly in the field of waste, does happen in the south, it happens primarily in the north. This has been especially true over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore have three questions for the Commission: what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people’s health, and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised?</p>
<p class="contents">Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission’s assessment of Law No 210 of 2008 and, in particular, of Article 9 on incentives for the construction of incinerators, in which European legislation on State aid is clearly infringed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The facts are that proceedings were brought against Italy, and quite rightly so. The court found against Italy – again, quite rightly so. Italy did not meet the deadline. Evidently, the government did submit a plan, but this was not forwarded in time. We keep coming back to the same situation. One cannot help but get the impression that those responsible delay and delay for as long as it takes for an emergency situation to arise, so that it can then react and make decisions using Italy’s emergency legislation – which overrides all other standards. If there is a lot of rubbish on the streets and if this is also mixed with industrial waste from the north and from the south, then it can quickly be put into unsecured landfill somewhere without taking or being able to take adequate precautions. To the honourable Members from Italy, I say that this is not an Italian debate. It is a debate about European law not being adhered to and not being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">If this way of dealing with things were to spread to other countries, then it would have consequences for the whole of Europe. What is happening down there is not a pleasant Sunday afternoon stroll. It is a scandal. It is not a matter of continually designating 536 new sites and using police violence to stop citizens protesting because they do not want domestic refuse that has been mixed with toxic industrial waste to be dumped on their doorsteps. It will not do. There must be consequences, and they must be consequences that make themselves felt. It is a good thing that the financial resources can no longer be used to the extent that they were previously. Enough has seeped away already. We need to impose tangible consequences once and for all, because what we are talking about here is the implementation of sensible, necessary and good European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For decades, people have been talking about the waste crisis in Naples and the Campania region. Although substantial funds have been set aside, it is true that there is still a crisis situation. There are no excuses, however. To say that northern Italy is responsible, or even – as my fellow Member said – that waste from the north can today be found on the streets of Naples is simply untrue.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility clearly lies with the previous local authorities, which allowed organised crime to freely traffic in waste, on the one hand, and failed to provide suitable and adequate collection and disposal areas, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is for the people of Campania and Naples to be brave and vote to replace their incompetent officials, as has already happened at regional level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The existing landfill sites are full to excess, while the building of new facilities is blocked by the communities concerned. However, the mistrust that citizens display towards any waste project can be explained by the fact that much has been promised in these times at a political level, but practically none of those promises have been kept.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, this problem has been dealt with to date by means of short-term interim solutions. Special commissions have been set up, but these have not even been obliged to keep local authorities and residents informed. On the other hand, disposable items are part of everyday life in Italy. As a result, its daily production of waste is far above the European average, while, at the same time, very little value is placed on separation of waste and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">The sad result of this lack of environmental awareness on both sides is that Campania is today a region with large areas of contamination, and the cancer rate among its residents and the rate of respiratory disease among children in the urban area of Naples are both much higher than the average for Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore an urgent need to find solutions and to get these implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that invoking Article 260 of the Treaty in order to obtain financial penalties, as some have done, is exploiting the situation. The regional council, which has been in place for only a few months, has already drawn up the hazardous waste plan and the plan on the integrated waste system. Furthermore, a separate-collection policy has been launched and initiatives to reduce the overall amount of waste produced have been adopted. Bidding is under way to construct an incinerator in Salerno, and the procedures relating to the publication of the call for tenders for the incinerator in East Naples are at an advanced stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the policies put in place are aimed not only at cleaning up the city, but also at devising an integrated waste system involving separate collection, a reduction in waste, the construction of modern facilities – not least to eliminate ‘ecoballs’, or huge mounds of compacted waste – and the redevelopment of old landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who are really to blame for what happened in the past should be punished. They certainly include former Campanian officials belonging to the left and, in particular, to the Greens, but also certain officials who, in northern Italy, used the local underworld to dump the toxic waste they produced.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must help Campania, without prejudice, and I call on everyone to work for, not against – do not work against just to live up to the media image of your party or your ideology. Do you genuinely think that imposing financial penalties on Campania will resolve the crisis? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Søndergaard and Mrs Lichtenberger, the crisis in Campania initially began and then developed so dramatically because of the inability of a regional council and a left-wing Naples city council, together with aldermen from the Greens, to take decisions – including unpopular and brave decisions – to create an environmentally friendly waste collection and disposal system. Irresponsibility, indecision, political gain, sinister collusion and waste characterised a political and administrative phase that is now definitively over.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed. The national government and the new regional council have shouldered their responsibilities and have the political determination to resolve the crisis. Through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve, they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by Nimby Syndrome, or the idea that people do not want others’ rubbish in their backyard.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, they have drawn up an integrated waste collection and disposal plan that will shortly provide incentives for separate collection and the construction of the necessary facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be extremely unfair, counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting: imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ruling or order by the European Court of Justice must be implemented once and for all, and the European rules on waste collection and disposal must be implemented in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the damage that has been done by illegal landfills also needs to be tackled. I know what I am talking about. In East Germany, we are still today – twenty years after reunification – having to deal with the pollution caused by illegal or poor waste disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not think that we will be successful in all this unless we attack the root of the problem. Talk about management all you like; the fact is that mafia structures exist there. We have to destroy these, otherwise we will not be successful in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite honestly, I would set four conditions. First, a waste management plan must be drawn up. It seems this has now been done. However, the Commission should also assist in this. Second, financial resources must be made available for the creation of new recycling facilities and waste facilities. Third, there must be harsher penalties for illegal disposal, and I also think – and I am directing my comments here at the Commission – that Europol and Eurojust should support the Italian police and prosecutors in their fight against organised crime.</p>

<p class="contents">The issue is a very complex one; it presents various types of problem, and finding an appropriate, definitive solution to it will take time. The oral questions we are discussing call for the application of the procedure laid down in Article 260 of the Treaty, but applying a financial penalty will not resolve the situation in Campania. By proceeding in this way, we would be in danger of endorsing a scenario in which a Member State is found guilty of an infringement on a purely objective basis, simply because it has not yet objectively fulfilled an obligation arising from European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The subjective behaviour of the State must be taken into account, too. It certainly cannot be said that Italy has failed to meet the obligation of sincere cooperation, but as the Commissioner has confirmed, the Commission staff are in constant contact with the Italian national and regional authorities and are closely monitoring the development of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no denying the will and commitment shown by Italy. It is important to stress that the operational role has shifted from the regions to the provinces, to allow for the development of a plan meeting the various requirements of the region. Europe must show solidarity with Italy, with both parties cooperating in perfect synergy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by mentioning that the regional council of Campania also used to comprise the Italy of Values party, which perhaps has a short memory these days – too short a memory to recall what it did or, rather, did not do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, I want to share with you the Italian response to the Community violation, and to point out that our concern is to defend the interests of the citizens and our people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Campania region and, in general, the Italian State are working on the creation of a network of waste disposal installations, in accordance with European law. I wish to point out that the European funds earmarked for waste disposal in Campania have been used for measure 1.7 of Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2000-2006 and for operating target 1.1 of ROP 2007-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to ROP 2000-2006, the Campania region has accounted for the EUR 140 million funding package made available; the money has been used to construct storage, treatment and recovery facilities, waste to energy facilities, and wet and dry separation facilities, to secure landfills, to construct, or extend, waste materials recovery facilities, and to implement separate-collection measures. As for ROP 2007-2013, EUR 110 million has been earmarked for the construction of waste treatment facilities, and EUR 50 million for the financing of municipal separate-collection facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The activities carried out under target 1.1 of ROP ERDF 2007-2013 and measure 1.7 of ROP 2000-2006 have been greatly restricted by the spending conditions imposed as a result of the infringement procedure launched in relation to the waste management situation in Campania. Consequently, a sum from the Fund for Underused Areas (FAS) has been set aside thus far to ensure the continuation of the activities subject to the European veto on the granting of ROP funds.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we feel it is important to be able to present to the Commission and Parliament the real difficulties that exist in complying quickly with the Court of Justice ruling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These problems are, first and foremost, down to the negligent attitude of central and local government institutions to waste management priorities. For example, in one of Lithuania’s towns, business people who want to build a waste incinerator are misleading the public by maintaining that the incineration of waste is the same as or better than other methods of waste management, such as avoidance and sorting. Unfortunately, local government institutions and managers responsible for waste management are failing to draw much attention to such misinformation. When addressing waste management problems in the European Union, I therefore call on the Commission to draw attention to such violations where waste management priorities laid down in the European Union directive on waste are not followed and there is encouragement not to follow them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be said that the institutions there are faced with an extremely difficult task. Not only do they have to deal with the waste management problems of the past – ecoballs being a particular issue – but also those of the present and the future. My impression from this trip was that management of today’s waste had been pretty much resolved at the time of our visit, in part, using military intervention. Resolved in that the waste was taken away from the city and dumped in landfill; unfortunately, it must be said, sometimes in illegal landfills. What we need are strategic solutions for the past but, above all, for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The offer made by the EU is good, comprehensible and fair. Once the region presents a coherent waste management plan, the European Union will release the funds. We should also encourage the local authorities to do this. I will say it again: as far as I am concerned, neither the Commission nor the European Parliament is interested in financial penalties. We are interested in seeing the waste problems being dealt with locally in Campania. We should make this deal with each other and work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are three or four issues which I would like to address. First is the issue which has been quite passionately addressed by many of you. The situation is critical; there is no quick fix. There have been some positive developments but it is obvious that we still need a systemic answer to the question. It is not easy but it is more than needed. In that respect, our partner in finding a solution is, of course, Italy, but cooperation with regional authorities in this respect is undoubtedly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am very much looking forward to the evaluation of the new draft waste management plan which we sincerely hope is what we all believe it should be. It will be evaluated by my services, by the experts, and I can assure you that it will be done in such a way that there will be the same treatment for Italy as for any other Member State, because it is of fundamental importance that we keep that trust between Member States on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">So when we talk about dealing with these problems, my approach could actually be put into four words. I want to be helpfully strict and strictly helpful. The idea is certainly not to impose fines. As was mentioned by some of you, the idea is to solve problems, but by imposing fines if there is no other way to solve the problems, because that is my duty.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am truly doing everything in cooperation with the Italian authorities so that we find proper solutions. That is my sincere hope. At the end of the day, we are talking about the health of Italian citizens and the Italian environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to mention is connected with the Waste Framework Directive. It is a new directive which was recently adopted. In that directive, it is pretty clear that each of the countries, as a matter of law, has to introduce a waste hierarchy. That means the best waste is no waste; there is re-use, recycling, energy regeneration and, if there is no other possibility, landfilling.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the picture which is taken from the report that will be published tomorrow on how efficient the Member States in the European Union are. It is about the trends in landfilling municipal waste because our best available data are on municipal waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Believe it or not, there are five Member States where landfilling is below 5% of municipal waste, but there are also seven Member States where landfilling is over 80%, so we have really very different situations in Europe when we deal with these programmes, and this is an issue which we certainly want to address. This picture is of the situation between 1995 and 2007 and, if it shows anything, it shows that if countries want, they can change. If they organise themselves in a proper way, they can really change.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally, you can today divide Europe into two parts: one part which sees waste as a problem and one part which sees waste as a major opportunity for resources and also for the new financial profits because that is the reality. I have heard many stories of the need for the question of who will take the waste to be decided by public procurement, because there are more than the necessary number of users who would like to have it in order to use it. However, for this purpose, the waste has to be selected at the very beginning. That is the fundamental and most important need.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing which I would like to mention is the honourable Member who said that we should be more careful about waste management problems elsewhere in the European Union. In the infringement cases by sector in 2009, waste accounts for 19%, water 20%, nature 19%, air 16%, and the rest less. We are looking horizontally at all implementation problems and we are bound to do that. I can assure you that we will do it also in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we should truly do our best, you as Members of Parliament and I as Commissioner for the Environment, to spread across Europe the message of waste as an opportunity for the future. We desperately need that message in the context of the limited resources which we are increasingly facing from day to day. Resource efficiency is the name of the problem and resource efficiency is at the core of our future competitiveness in Europe. If you do not believe me, ask me in 10 years’ time. I can guarantee that this will be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is unfortunate that we are discussing the subject again, as Parliament has already passed a resolution on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the resolution we have proposed for vote tomorrow is very clear. We would appeal to our Lithuanian colleagues to reflect further on this matter and to make sure that whatever legislation they pass will not discriminate against LGBT people.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have much to say about the resolution, but I think it is becoming increasingly clear that the European Union needs to equip itself with stronger legal instruments for the enforcement of fundamental rights. We recently debated the controversial media law in Hungary and now we are facing very similar issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have laid down the principles – the shared values of 500 million citizens – in the European treaties but, when it comes to putting them into practice, we run into trouble. Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to hear your views on our proposal for a European road map for LGBT rights. The European Union has done a lot for gender equality in the past and, indeed, we have regular road maps for gender equality. We have all sorts of strategies to combat racism and xenophobia, to combat social exclusion and to strengthen fundamental rights, but not for LGBT people. I think it is very urgent and very necessary that we have such a strategy: a strategy to fight prejudice, ignorance, discrimination and hatred and to strengthen the rights of LGBT people.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many examples of the problem. Today, we are discussing the amendments which have been put to the Lithuanian Parliament, but that should not distract us from the fact that homophobia exists in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to bring another fact to your attention, Commissioner, and to hear your views on it. This concerns the European asylum policy, and the fact is that people seeking asylum because they are prosecuted on grounds of their sexual orientation in a Member State which I will not name have to undergo something known as a phallometric test. This is particularly degrading. It has no place in the European Union and I would like to hear what the Commission intends to do about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But I would like to take a different angle to hopefully convince those in this Parliament who have not yet decided on voting in favour of this resolution. You know what? Last summer, four Members of the European Parliament, Mrs in ’t Veld, myself, Mr Cashman and Mr Fjellner, representing four groups, the majority of this Parliament, were in Vilnius, in Lithuania, together with the first Baltic Pride to be held in Vilnius, empowering and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in this city and we were there under the European flag telling everybody, ‘this flag protects us, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and that is true also for Lithuania’.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what would happen to us and to Lithuanians who next year might go marching in favour of our equal rights in Vilnius if this law is adopted in the Seimas? Each one of us could be fined up to EUR 2 900 for publicly promoting sexual orientation – meaning homosexuality in this case, because I guess for heterosexuality that does not apply. Is that really what this Parliament would want? Is that what the Parliament of Lithuania would want, the parliament of a country which, 20 years ago, struggled for its own freedom, with lesbians and gays among the people struggling for that freedom?</p>
<p class="contents">So I am very happy that the President of Lithuania, Mrs Grybauskaitė, former Commissioner, and the government of Lithuania, have already said that this proposed law contravenes Lithuania’s obligations under its own constitution. I hope it will be clear that different forms of sexuality, of sexual orientation, of forms of living, have been part of all cultures and of all societies and are so in Lithuania, as well, and that hiding facts like that from the public, from young people, is simply a basis for inciting hatred, hate speech and hate crimes. That is something that I think nobody in this Parliament or in the Lithuanian parliament would want.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I hope that we will have the support of this Parliament and of the Commissioner for the resolution. We do not need your support, but I hope we have it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is another example of a law which could be used to deny recognition to the partnerships and marriages of same-sex couples from other Member States. We have already debated this in this House, in September last year, and, because some questions remained unanswered then, we and other members of Parliament sent a letter requesting clarification. Your Commissioner sent us a reply, in which, amongst other things, he wrote that the residence rights of such couples is recognised by European law. I have this question to put to you: are you also going to challenge Lithuania in cases where one of the partners is not a national of a Member State? I would appreciate a very clear answer on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read in the Commission Work Programme that, in 2013, the Commission is going to draft a legislative proposal on the mutual recognition of the effects of certain acts of civil status. My question is: Does that proposal also include the mutual recognition of marriages and partnerships? If so, that is, in itself, good news, but why only in 2013?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has announced that it will take the necessary action once its officials have analysed the Lithuanian legislation, and my question is: has the analysis been carried out yet and have your officials, as part of that analysis, considered what the consequences could be for the recognition of same-sex couples from other Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">What action will the Commission take against Lithuania, then, and what will it do about Romania, for example, whose legislation specifically excludes recognition?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you promised during the September debate that you would respond rapidly to the report by the European Fundamental Rights Agency on homophobia. However, in your letter, you simply referred to the Commission’s annual report. Do you not think that, in light of the developments in Lithuania, that matter should be given much more attention? Could you also make a promise that you will issue a separate report on homophobia in the European Union as soon as possible? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just when it seems that we are making progress in the European Union, at least insofar as we know what basic human rights are, we get a signal from one of the Member States that this simply is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that it is necessary to prohibit by law, for example, the promotion of relationships other than heterosexual ones seems to us to be unbelievably regressive, riding roughshod over what we have achieved together on human rights over recent years in the European Parliament and in cooperation with you, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Protecting the spiritual health of children is just a shameful pretext exploited by insecure politicians. We must and we want to protect children. We must protect them particularly against violence and poverty, and we want to provide the conditions for their education, safety and personal development. Everyone, however, or a majority of us, know from our own experience that children are not harmed by displays of affections and love, nor by the promotion of relationships other than heterosexual ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore firmly believe that it is no longer appropriate in this day and age for us to hold discussions with the proponents of such views, Commissioner, or to keep on trying to explain something to them. To try and explain to them why their views are so woefully misguided.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there is a need to take decisive action. There is a need to state unambiguously that attempts at homophobic legislation are unambiguously contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union, and are quite clearly in conflict with the treaties, with the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights and with the European Convention on Human Rights. They do not respect freedom of expression and information or freedom of assembly, or the prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask, Commissioner, in the event that such a law is passed, whether the Commission will initiate proceedings against Lithuania concerning the violation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is also why, on 22 November 2010, I visited Lithuania and discussed with President Dalia Grybauskaitė and the Minister of Justice the proposal to amend the Administrative Code, which establishes a new offence punishable by a fine for ‘the promotion of homosexual relations or financing of such promotion in public places’, as well as the related proposal to amend the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest information in my possession, the adoption by the Lithuanian Parliament of this draft amendment to the Administrative Code was postponed and is now expected to take place in spring this year. This means that it is still under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is examining the proposals to amend the Lithuanian Administrative and Penal Codes, as well as other Lithuanian legislation, from the perspective of compliance with relevant EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, the Commission expressed serious concerns to the Lithuanian authorities in relation to the compatibility with Union law and fundamental rights of the Lithuanian Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information. Following the Commission’s intervention, this law was amended in December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">The law qualifies as detrimental to minors information that ‘expresses contempt for family values, encourages the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania’. The practical application of this law may raise questions in terms of compliance with the e-Commerce and Audiovisual Media Services Directives and with the principle of non-discrimination. The Commission is continuing to look into this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information in my possession, an amendment to the Law on Provision of Information took effect on 18 October 2010. This amendment prescribes that ‘advertising and audiovisual commercial communication […] must not contain manifestation or promotion of sexual orientation’. If these provisions were to remain in the law, we would see the same problems in terms of compliance with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and possible violation of Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 2010, the Commission wrote to the Lithuanian Government expressing worries about the last-minute suspension of the Baltic Gay Pride event. You will remember this. We recalled in that letter that freedom of peaceful assembly, as provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 12 of the Charter, is one of the principles on which the Union is founded. On that basis, Baltic Gay Pride was held on 8 May 2010: that was the event to which a previous speaker referred.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of a possible European strategy on the fight against homophobia, the Commission’s priority is to ensure that EU legislation complies fully with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including Article 21 prohibiting discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. How this is to be achieved was explained very clearly in the Commission’s communication on the strategy for effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, adopted on 19 October 2010. We will come back to this matter in the annual report on application of the Charter, which also covers progress on the application of Article 21. That will happen in spring of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">According to this logic, the phallometric test as a procedure under asylum policy is, of course, subject to EU law and relates directly to Article 21 of the Charter, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. This clearly means that if, in EU law or in its application at national level, there is discrimination, then the Union is empowered to intervene. It is very clear that the Union can intervene here.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to reiterate the Commission’s strong commitment to combating homophobia and discrimination based on sexual orientation, to the full extent of the powers conferred by the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the recognition of civil status, we have no intention of proposing any legislation that would interfere with Member States’ substantive family law or modify national definitions of marriage. This is subsidiarity. Our green paper on recognition of civil status is designed for cross-border situations, such as the recognition of birth certificates, and is not concerned with the recognition of same-sex marriage. We must not mix things up. It is for the Member States to define what marriage is. It is for the European Union to permit free movement and non-discrimination. These are two completely different things. Such is the position in European law and that is what we apply in real terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe should fight against all forms of discrimination and that includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. At the same time, we have to respect the right of any democracy, as long as it respects human rights and the non-discrimination principle, to discuss, modify and adopt national laws, without interfering in the debates of national parliaments, without infringing the principle of subsidiarity and without acting or condemning a Member State prematurely.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not like the idea of condemning a Member State, especially since, in this particular case, the proposed modifications have not even been voted on by the plenary of the Lithuanian Parliament and are still under review by the Lithuanian authorities. Not only that, but the proposed modifications have already been deemed to be in conflict with European law by the Lithuanian authorities themselves, who have declared that they will be taking action to remedy the situation and to respect the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. So this proposed legislation will probably not even make it onto the statute book of Lithuania and therefore there is no need to condemn this Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I do hope nonetheless that tomorrow, the EPP will be able to support the joint resolution as long as it does not condemn any individual Member State and as long as it is modified to make it more balanced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

David Cameron, then Conservative leader and now Prime Minister, said 18 months ago that his party was wrong in its support for that 1988 law, which was subsequently repealed. Indeed David Cameron predicted that the first openly gay Prime Minister in the UK would be a Tory. We will see, but that is what he predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">So you could see a huge change in attitudes in the space of two decades. This development in attitudes, which my colleague, Charles Tannock, knows a lot more about, and this move by the centre right are reflected in a quite modest and moderate EPP resolution and, indeed, in Simon Busuttil’s opening remarks. I am hopeful that the EPP might be able to rally to the main resolution if most of their amendments are accepted in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The situation in the UK has been transformed to the extent that the proprietors of a small guest house were today forced to pay compensation to a gay couple whom they refused to allow to stay, in breach of the law. As the judge remarked, these proprietors were perfectly at liberty to hold or discuss their personal views on homosexuality, but what they could not do was discriminate on the basis of those views. It is talk, discussion, debate, right of assembly that would be affected by the proposed Lithuanian laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Banning the promotion or propagation of homosexuality is likely to have a chilling effect on free speech and discussions, as the Fundamental Rights Agency has pointed out. I join Sophie in ’t Veld in calling for an EU road map to combat homophobia and discrimination and I call on everyone across the political spectrum in this House to unite in support of the whole range of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their Parliament seems to be becoming ever more shameless in the way in which it is curtailing gay rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take action to stop this. The values and laws of the EU cannot be treated like an à la carte menu – we will take this dish, but not that one. Anyone who wants to become and remain a member of the EU must comply with all our legislation. That applies to Lithuania, but it equally applies to France and the Netherlands. Suppose the Netherlands, for example, starts tampering with the rights of migrants at some point in the future. We must take action. If we do not do this, it will mean that no one in the Union will actually be able to feel that they are really well protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commissioner has immediately started a legal analysis and I hope it will be followed up on very soon.

Every country that wants to become a Member State of the EU must commit to that principle and be signatory to the ECHR, not least with regard to sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">When Lithuania joined the EU seven years ago, it pledged to uphold our common values of tolerance and equality. Since then, the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights – and I believe its Articles 12 and 21 – have come into force, further guaranteeing in law citizens’ freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation at EU institutional level.</p>
<p class="contents">As a spokesman for my party and group on human rights issues outside the Union, I can say categorically that the ECR upholds and endorses principles of equality, tolerance and diversity everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">However, many Europeans do hold traditional views with regard to homosexuality, often based on religious conviction. Just as we seek to uphold the law to protect LGBT rights, so too should we seek to ensure that those who wish to express contrary, non-inflammatory views within the bounds of the law regarding free speech should be free to do so as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, Lithuanian society remains, by and large, conservative and we should understand that. People are entitled to their own private views, but at an institutional and legal level, we cannot compromise on the principle that we are all equal. Equality is a hallmark of our progressive society in Europe, and I believe in fact that the legal safeguards and individual rights guaranteed by the EU acted as a kind of magnet to countries such as Lithuania as they emerged from communist totalitarian domination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Lithuanian authorities to reflect on the fact that the EU is committed to preventing the marginalisation, vilification and persecution of minorities that was so commonplace throughout Europe for the first half of the 20th century. The Commission should indeed look at this proposed draft Lithuanian piece of legislation and pronounce whether or not, in its opinion, this piece of legislation is compatible with EU law – although, as Simon Busuttil put it, it is entirely possible that this bill will not become law, as Lithuania is a democracy and is only too well aware of all the issues we are going to raise in this debate tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How cruelly ironic that a country which threw off the shackles of Stalinist dictatorship only 20 years ago should now revert to aping one of the many crimes of that system: the suppression of the right of people to live freely and in peace according to their own sexual identity.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute the courage of the hundreds of gay people and their supporters who braved the hate campaign against them to march in the Baltic Pride parade in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, in May of last year. It is revolting to see right-wing politicians scapegoating gay people in Lithuania. The political establishment in that country has dismally failed its people, particularly the youth. Just as in Ireland, market capitalism and financial speculation have devastated the economies of the Baltic States, including Lithuania, where unemployment has rocketed to 18% and youth unemployment to a staggering 35%. In these circumstances, using minorities, including gay people, as scapegoats is a standard, cynical way to divert attention from the failures of the establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as in the hate campaign against gays in Uganda, the homophobic campaign in Lithuania tries to insinuate that gay people pose a threat to children, implying sexual abuse of children. This is a poisonous slander, designed to confuse and mislead. It is a slander that would have parents look in the wrong direction to protect their children. Coming from Ireland, I can confirm tragically that threats to children come traditionally from within institutions where they are supposed to be safe, within certain families and within certain areas of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reprehensible that young people in Lithuania coping with their emerging sexuality – which is a difficult enough time – must now do so in a climate of intolerance and fear. So, we should stand in solidarity with the right of all people in Lithuania, in Russia, throughout the European Union, and elsewhere, to live in peace and in accordance with their own identities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know this goes beyond the context of this particular case, but do not forget that in future, these conflicts of rights will become a huge problem for the European Union more and more often, and that, if we continue to expand the scope of so-called citizen’s rights and freedoms, we will reach a point where we will have to decide whose rights and freedoms have priority over others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of the European Parliament is undoubtedly, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to consider every case where there may be a violation of human rights, which may also result from membership of particular social groups. Parliament has proposed resolutions in this regard on numerous occasions. It has always opposed the violation of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is also a result of the concern that a proposed change to Lithuanian law could lead to the restriction, for example, of freedom of speech in Lithuania on the grounds of sexual orientation. This concern is well-founded in the sense that the European Parliament has repeatedly raised instances of selective treatment of human rights in Lithuania by the government of that country. I am thinking here of ethnic minority groups in particular, which are not treated equally in Lithuanian law regarding the rights due to them. This is why it is worth stressing that draft laws of a country should comply with defined standards and be in accordance with European Union law, which guarantees equal treatment for specified minorities, including ethnic minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, there have been cases where individual Members of the Lithuanian Parliament have initiated laws that violate human rights and discriminate against citizens. However, I would like to report that last Wednesday, the Lithuanian Government gave a negative conclusion on the proposal debated in the Lithuanian Parliament to introduce penalties for the public promotion of homosexual relations, because it is contrary to international and European Union legislation, as well as the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, and is regarded as discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In addition, having ratified the Treaty of Lisbon, Lithuania must respect the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which prohibits any form of discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. This bill was condemned by the President of the Republic of Lithuania, Ms Dalia Grybauskaitė. I would like to point out that the amendments proposed in the bill have not yet been adopted by the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania. Furthermore, the Lithuanian Parliament’s Committee on Human Rights has yet to present its conclusion on these proposed amendments. I hope that Lithuania will take into account EU and international criticism, the negative conclusion of the government of the Republic of Lithuania and the European Parliament resolution, and that the Lithuanian Parliament will have the political will to reject the law proposed, which would violate human rights and freedoms, and that all discrimination will be stopped, including discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think there are two facts of which we need to remind some colleagues who may have forgotten them. The first is that homosexuality has been declassified as a mental illness; and the second, which is particularly relevant here, is that there is no credible research to show that educating children about homosexuality can affect their sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">These are facts, and no legal text or proposed legislation can contradict them. So the message we want to send tomorrow is simply to remind our colleagues that these matters should not be up for discussion. That is why we need to pass this resolution and that is why we also need to support the attempts by the President of Lithuania to stop what is happening. But I insist: the message is directed not only at the Lithuanians but also at all those who still presume, on occasion, to put such matters up for discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should certainly show more confidence in the legislative process in Lithuania and more understanding for those members of the Lithuanian Parliament who are actually pointing out that children and young people in particular should be better protected against frequently aggressive exposure to material with a sexual content. This is a completely natural debate. It seems that the rights of children in this debate have been completely disregarded.

However, in some European countries, the level of tolerance for sexual minorities is still too low. There are cases of incitement of hatred towards homosexuals, prohibition of marches for equality, and even legal regulations which contravene European Union law, such as the discriminatory Lithuanian draft law. The creation of a uniform, minimal EU level of protection for people affected by discrimination due to age, sexual orientation, disability, religion or world-view would put a stop to these practices. When will this happen? The complete separation of church and state is important, as homophobia is spreading in those areas where religion plays too great a role. Even now, homosexuality is illegal in 76 countries across the world, and 8 Islamic countries impose the death penalty for homosexual relations. In Europe, at most we only have provisions or draft laws which discredit the free world. This is why our resolution and the EU Anti-Discrimination Directive are so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union. Firstly, I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009, the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied, and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day Parade failed and the parade took place. I am all the more astonished, therefore, that new legislative measures are now being proposed under which speaking publicly about or providing information on homosexual relations could effectively result in fines of up to EUR 2 900 and there will no longer be equal opportunities for homosexual people – but at least for women.</p>

<p class="contents">I hope that a nearly unanimous decision in tomorrow’s vote will underline these principles which have been freely agreed upon by 27 Member States, which are the principles behind our European directives, and which have been reinforced by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I can only subscribe to the strong position of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very disappointing that the Lithuanian Parliament has gone as far as criminalisation of the dissemination of information about sexual orientation on the pretext of protecting minors, religious feelings and political convictions. It is a clear violation of freedom of expression and it cannot be justified even by the will of the majority of the population. Inviolable rights of minorities are always an attribute of democracy, but the Lithuanian Parliament has mistaken populism for democracy. I would like to see the Lithuanian Parliament amending or repealing laws that are, in their essence, homophobic and in breach of the Lithuanian constitutional law, the European Convention on Human Rights, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I applaud the courage of the Lithuanian President, Dalia Grybauskaitė, in standing up against discrimination in public and hope that others will follow her suit. However, should the Lithuanian Parliament fail to comply with its international obligations, an intervention on behalf of the European Union is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
