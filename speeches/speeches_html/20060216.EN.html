We have had no reply from your office and I would ask you whether it is normal procedure for you, as President of Parliament, not to reply to Members of this House?</p>

This was a free vote on whether to include private healthcare within the scope of the directive, not healthcare overall.

It follows that there is no dispute about two possible options, as there is only one possible course of action. Mrs Gebhardt is right to point out that you have the right to alter one of your own amendments, and the information supplied by the services is correct in that respect. Irrespective of your own intentions – and it is not the majority that is right but the law that is right – it is open to us to take over in our own name an amendment already submitted. That is what Rule 150(5) says. That has nothing to do with your actions.</p>

I should like to pay tribute to the considerable work done by Mr Harbour, who - along with my friend, Mr Toubon - followed the matter on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. There was an increasingly urgent need to legislate so as not to leave it to the Court of Justice’s magistrates to ‘lay down the law’ on the fourth fundamental freedom of the Union as it relates to services.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise makes it possible to outline a framework supporting the competitiveness and development of service activities, which represent 70% of GDP and great potential in terms of growth and job creation, while combating the risks of social dumping. Mr Chirac, the President of the French Republic, was right to oppose the first text presented in January 2004 by the Prodi Commission, and the European Parliament did its job as co-legislator properly. This is a victory for responsible democracy and a major step towards the construction of a social market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1) This House may well have made improvements to the Commission draft, but I do not regard them as sufficient. It is wrong that it should still apply to a number of public service sectors, to what are termed services of general economic interest. This directive really should not apply to such operations as, for example, the collection of household waste and the supply of water. Moreover, framework legislation is needed to put the right to public service provision on a secure footing.</p>
<p class="contents">2) Certain points in the directive can be interpreted in more than one way. The public currently take a sceptical view of Europe and so legal uncertainty in legislation is the least we need. </p>
<p class="contents">3) What we need is a social and trustworthy Europe with the same harmonised ground rules across the whole of internal market, and this directive is no way to create one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am nevertheless pleased to see that such sensitive sectors as port services, employment agencies, care of the elderly, the health sector and childcare have been excluded from the directive’s scope and that, moreover, each country’s social achievements remain intact, thus making social dumping impossible.

<p class="contents">The great majority of the activities of craftsmen remain subject to competition at a time when, in my country, this sector employs the most people and creates the most jobs. Even though the overly explicit references to the country of origin principle have disappeared, there are still areas in which this scandalous principle will apply in full or in part. The uncertainties, the grey areas and the inconsistencies that remain will give the Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to apply its own interpretation to the directive. Well, the Court has always ruled in favour of those who considered that certain standards – particularly social ones – constituted an intolerable obstacle to competition. The Commission will have an excuse for pushing harmonisation downwards in areas lying outside its powers, such as social protection and labour law.</p>

I reject the absurd principles that underpin it; I reject social and legal dumping and the free competition that is praised to the skies but responsible for unemployment; I reject the planned relocations; and I reject this Eurocracy that refuses to take into account what the nations think, so that it can continue imposing unwanted policies on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the Services Directive and believe that, irrespective of the country they come from, services companies should not be discriminated against in any EU country.</p>
<p class="contents">The core issue in the debate on the Services Directive is that of whether the directive should be guided by the country of origin principle (Article 16). The June List values both the internal market and national self-determination. The fundamental question is thus as follows: does the country of origin principle entail such decisive advantages that we are prepared to renounce national sovereignty? Our answer to that question is no.</p>
<p class="contents">The country of origin principle relates to significant, but strictly limited, areas such as construction, installation work and consultancy services. We welcome competition within these areas, but believe that it must take place on conditions that are fair to all parties. We believe that Swedish rules must apply on Swedish territory. We thus support what is known as the host country principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also of the view that national monopolies on services should be respected. Precisely what shape is to be taken by these services should be decided following broad discussion in the respective Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows from the aforesaid position that we have chosen to support the compromise put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a result of the resounding condemnation of the worst aspects of this proposal and the workers’ campaign to have the directive rejected, the majority in Parliament has excluded some areas from its scope, putting a decision on them back to a later date and, in a feat of legal sleight of hand, has concealed the regulation applying the law on the country of origin of the service provider.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, although the ambitious plans of the large economic and financial groups have not all been realised, competition has been stepped up in a number of service sectors, including public services. This will have a damaging impact on workers’ rights and on the services provided to the people. In the same way, the sovereignty of individual countries is being cut back even further, strengthening the role of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the liberalisation of services has not yet been adopted. The Council, on which the Portuguese Government has a seat, needs to assume its responsibilities.

This whole matter is nothing other than a huge farce designed to push through what the liberals, the conservatives and the Left – all as zealously pro-European as each other – have been cleverly concocting with their respective national governments for nearly two years. Whether it is a question of the Bolkestein Directive, the Services Directive or the Gebhardt report, all of these texts that form the subject of controversies and of compromises extracted <span class="italic">in extremis </span>by the political groups of the European Parliament are the same and should be forcefully rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are resolutely opposed to this ultraliberal and anti-national vision of the internal market in services, the only aim of which is ultimately to destroy our craft industry and our small French businesses under the guise of ‘free and undistorted competition’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what the Court of Justice confirmed by recognising a COP, a country of origin principle. For the blind among us, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, signed in Marrakech in April 1994, laid down, throughout the world, a ‘fourth mode’ of service provision, in the form of a cross-border provision of services, that is to say of a temporary switch to the social dumping conditions of the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this old principle that the leaders of Europe are now pretending to discover, whereas this COP has been devastating European economies for decades. Seeking to maintain the French-influenced European social model, with its pensions, its health protection, its free schools, its post offices, its trains and its hospitals, demands that we not only oppose workers being paid the lowest possible wages, as practised in the most socially backward countries, but that we also oppose the idea of a market without customs protection, which is the real cause of social dumping. The rule of the COP is only one symptom of this social dumping. The starting point – the first rogue cell – of this social cancer is the idea of the single market, without the protection of customs duties. The country of origin rule is nothing other than a secondary cancer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With more than 53 cases before the European Court of Justice, where businesses are arguing for their right under the Treaty to provide services across Europe, it is time for us to set down rules for the operation of the service market. Parliament has listened to people's concerns and fears and ensured that the freedom to provide services is not the freedom to undermine citizens' employment terms and conditions and their rights as consumers.

The social democrats had already made enough disgraceful concessions to the conservatives, but, just before the end, they made another one, the consequence of which was that the directive would continue to apply to ‘social policy’ and ‘consumer protection’, just as the freedom to provide services already did to ‘services of general economic interest’. This is quite utterly unacceptable.</p>

The conduct of the German Social Democrats has been particularly shameful, in that they – unlike their French counterparts – were unswervingly loyal to the Bolkestein directive and sent their own natural supporters as lambs to the slaughter.</p>

The Services Directive is designed to remove the obstacles to two of the freedoms that have formed part of the EC Treaty since 1958: freedom of establishment for suppliers of services, and freedom of movement for services. The potential for the trade in services is huge, and Sweden is one of those countries that has most to gain from an efficient market for services.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the Services Directive has been wide-ranging. Swedish and European trade unions point out that the directive contributes to ‘social dumping’. That is not the case, because the directive does not deal with issues relating to labour law. The labour law aspects have, moreover, been clarified by Parliament’s decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see a constructive Services Directive that clears away administrative rules and other barriers to trade. I also want the scope of the directive to be as broad as possible. I therefore voted in favour of areas such as private health care, temporary agencies and services of general economic interest being covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's decision by Parliament is based partly on a broad compromise. Compromises are seldom perfect but are often necessary if the objective in question is to be achieved. I hope that the EU Member States are successful in taking a decision on the issue later this year so that we might make progress on this very important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the fancy name used to describe the disappearance of our agricultural production to the benefit of producers from Brazil, Australia or the South Pacific, with the consolation prize of modest jobs as landscape gardeners for the surviving members of France’s and Europe’s farming communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural development is just as hypocritical a concept as ‘multifunctional agriculture’. It is a pain reliever, a palliative remedy applied to women and men from the countryside, who are knowingly and disgracefully sacrificed to the all-important ‘global deal’. In the South Pacific, the focus is on agriculture; in Europe, the focus is on the illusory services market.</p>
<p class="contents">Having stupidly ‘sold out’ its farmers, Europe goes and invents a pharisaic ‘rural development’ policy in the human and economic desert that Brussels has created in our countryside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, it must be illegal to shout 'fire' in a cinema or to directly provoke racial hatred. I find it difficult to understand, on that basis, how Nick Griffin, the leader of the neo-fascist British Nationalist Party, was acquitted of promoting racial hatred earlier this month after his comments on both Islam and the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I am not sure I see the Danish cartoons that were published falling into that category. They were certainly offensive to many, but that does not mean they meet the same test as promoting racial hatred. Certainly, when I see opposition to their publication coming from the fundamentalist Christian right in Europe, I start to worry that the laws of blasphemy are being dusted off again across Europe. The correct position would have been not to forbid publication, but to condemn the content of many of them.</p>

All those doing their utmost for the 'freedom of the press' deliberately overlook the fact that Mohammed and Islam are identified with terrorism in the cartoons, in order to prepare public opinion to accept new wars and imperialist interventions against countries with a Muslim population.

Liberal democracy has proved unable to impose the rule of law on the Muslim communities in Europe or any respect for religious freedom on Muslim states. Instead, by making freedom of speech an absolute, it has managed to cause affront to the religious sensibilities of Muslims. Freedom without responsibility inevitably leads to conflict, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for national and religious sensibilities provides the basis for respecting the people who express them, irrespective of whether we agree with these views or not. These sensibilities must not, therefore, be offended by blasphemous representations of the cross, of Mohammed or of the victims of the Holocaust. Mr Cohn-Bendit is not right in claiming that religions become ‘de-religionised’ in the public sphere. Religion will always be different from political debate, unless, of course, it stops being a religion and becomes an ideology. A cartoon depicting Mr Cohn-Bendit is not the same as a cartoon depicting Mohammed.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply cannot compel other actors in the public arena to divest themselves of their religious sensitivity. Any attempt to do so will have the same consequences as the publication of the Mohammed cartoons.

I wish to stress that this does not, in any way, involve relations between countries but, rather, relations between people belonging to the Muslim or Catholic faiths. The Jewish community was forced to flee the country at the start of the conflict and never became involved in it. A further peculiarity is that when the country came into being, most of the orthodox community lived in rural areas, whereas most Muslims lived in the cities. We ought to bear this in mind when we draw up EU aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome Article 16 of the Resolution, calling for more attention to be paid to the special needs of rural areas. It is also high time to call on the Hague Tribunal to start pursuing those war criminals that were motivated by reasons other than religious belief. In the terminology used here, we are talking about the Serbs. We must admit that even this Parliament has sometimes failed to reach a just conclusion. For example, some passages of the Resolution before us, regarding the tenth anniversary of the events in Srebrenice hold only one side culpable of mass murder, in contrast with the established facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that dictatorial methods that have been used by the current administrators in the country are now consigned to the past. This is another positive report attempting to support economic development, not least through the agreement of the Western Balkan states on the return of refugees and on compensation for damage to property.

Bosnia was disbanded as an administrative unit in the 1920s and re-established after the Second World War as a mixed area in the centre of the federal state that was intended to help integrate the different peoples within Yugoslavia, of which it was itself a miniature version. That proved a complete washout. During the 1992-1995 war, each of those groups made unilateral attempts to impose their own wishes. Dayton was a panacea intended to provide peace and reconciliation, and, whilst it is an inefficient and costly structure, it was born from the need for conciliation between widely diverse aspirations, and so, despite all its flaws, it should not simply be discarded, but should instead be used to build a federal structure in which all can live sustainably in peace with one another.

<p class="contents">Currently, the issue of how forests and wood relate to the processes of environmentally friendly wealth creation and social progress is very inadequately covered in European public policies. It is time for the European Union significantly to support the projects based on the forest-wood sector in relevant geographical areas. The link between a forestry strategy and rural development must be established and, while we are on the subject, I regret that mountain areas should not have been singled out for attention. Equally, and this in the context of the Lisbon Strategy, the Union must take a greater interest in supporting research programmes linked to the use of wood, for example in the construction and energy sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a study, as a precursor to action, should be conducted on the transportation of wood, which is a heavy product, so as to provide some coherence between forests, areas of consumption and road, rail and maritime transport infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As someone who lives in one of the last important remaining oak forests in England, I am acutely aware of the need for sustainable forest management. Forests have a multi-functional role. In the Forest of Dean, the forest provides a beautiful environment and a natural habitat, opportunities for recreation and tourism, potential for work and industrial realities, as well as a home for people to live in. And yet, in the majority of cases, the multi-functional role, measured against the potential it offers, is not reflected in the economy of the areas concerned or in the income of their inhabitants. Rural development policy is the main instrument for implementing the forestry strategy at Community level and I support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This policy area constitutes a very important national issue. We should have liked the European Parliament to have stated that the objective was for forestry policy to remain an area for national decision-making. We met with a certain amount of sympathy for this view in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety during the discussion of this report. Unfortunately, however, the majority of the European Parliament has, in accordance with its usual obsession with doing everything on an abnormally large scale, prepared a report which, for example, will cause the sector-specific Community policy and the Lisbon Strategy to have an impact on forestry and which recommends that an ‘objective report [be] drawn up to examine the scope for creating a separate legal basis for forests’ in the EU’s Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We decisively reject such shifts in the political statements made by the European Parliament. It should be explained once and for all that forestry policy is an area in which decisions are to be taken purely and simply on a national basis.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Letta, and all of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent work they have done on the proposed Regulation on this type of statistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in particular, to emphasise the fact that, in its work, Parliament has stressed the need to make the data provided for in this Regulation available as soon as possible. There is no need for me to remind you that our most direct competitors, the United States and Japan, have had detailed information about their companies’ external investments for more than twenty years, and this puts their governments and economic actors at a considerable advantage compared to Europe when it comes to drawing up their strategies and commercial policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore considers it very desirable for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on this proposal for a Regulation at first reading, so that the collection of this type of data can begin this very year. I believe that both institutions are very close to an agreement, and we hope that it is reached as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the Regulation responds to a vacuum in the Community statistics that puts us at a disadvantage. At the moment, we only have the data that certain Member States collect on a voluntary basis, either within the context of structural economic statistics or the compilation of its balance of payments statistics. It is not possible to calculate aggregates for the European Union of twenty-five, however, given the diversity of the methods used and the type of information compiled.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to point out the importance of completing the internal market and the importance for all of us of the Lisbon Strategy and its objectives of increasing growth and employment and of making the European Union an attractive area for investments and one that favours entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, this is a year in which the importance of defending European interests in multilateral commercial negotiations is particularly obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The data that this Regulation is intended to obtain is extremely useful in all of these respects. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about a type of statistic that is essential to increasing the dynamism, vitality and competitiveness of European companies and economic actors.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Commission believes that the amendments that the honourable Members have presented and discussed and that are aimed at speeding up the implementation of the compilation of this data provide an excellent basis for reaching a compromise at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, for the same reason, the Commission does not agree that it is necessary to maintain the amendments relating to Parliament’s role in implementing the Regulation, since, given its very technical nature, this kind of amendment would provide relatively little added value, while almost certainly preventing an agreement with the Council at first reading; I am referring, of course, to Amendments 1, 2 and 9, which are aimed at extending the procedures of the so-called Lamfalussy process, in relation to the legislation on financial services, to the field of the compilation of statistical data.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members, and in particular the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which is also responsible for the negotiation of the directives on financial services, are in a privileged position to appreciate the differences between the two sectors. There is no need to remind you of the different levels of implementation of the legislation on financial services and the reasons, very different to those in relation to the case we are discussing today, why the Commission considered it appropriate, on some of these levels, for Parliament to have a greater capacity for scrutiny than that laid down in the current rules on comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, before I finish, I would like to stress two factors to the honourable Members, in the hope that you will reconsider your position on these three amendments: 1, 2 and 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, account must be taken of the existing agreement amongst the institutions to set the definitive parameters for the compilation of data, once the results of the pilot studies are known, by means of the codecision procedure. In this way, Parliament will have full capacity, together with the Council, to play its role as legislator in the essential aspects of the implementation of this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that the current Austrian Presidency has expressed its political will to reach a satisfactory agreement with Parliament on the review of the rules on comitology. As you are well aware, a compromise in this field that will reflect more fairly Parliament’s legitimate aspirations to play its role as legislator fully is within sight.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, Mr President, while repeating, of course, that the Commission is willing to keep Parliament fully informed at all times of the work of the different committees, I hope that this Parliament’s vote will facilitate an agreement on this Regulation at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive is very important, and our aim in drafting it is to regulate two types of data on foreign affiliates, namely inward statistics, which relate to all the businesses and sectors that are under foreign control, and outward statistics, which relate to foreign enterprises that are controlled by a company located in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Almunia said, the Commission proposes to establish a mandatory reference framework for the compilation of Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal includes two different modules for collecting inward and outward data. The module for inward FATS is based on the Structural Business Statistics Regulation, while the one for outward FATS is the same as that used for foreign direct investment in the Regulation for Balance of Payments Statistics. Whereas the provisions for inward FATS would be for the most part mandatory, the provisions for outward FATS include a voluntary experimental phase based on pilot studies aimed at assessing the feasibility and costs of collecting data.</p>
<p class="contents">The critical element for this directive is the fact that, as Commissioner Almunia just pointed out, the United States and Japan have already had this kind of information available to them for over 20 years, in even greater detail than what is provided for in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal includes pilot studies and comitology procedures with long transition periods. That is liable to leave European political officials without adequate data for a long time yet, while their US and Japanese counterparts can now already access better information on the economic strategies and trends of their own enterprises and transnational companies, including in the area of outward FATS.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we believe that the Commission proposal must be supported, but with a few requirements taken into consideration. Firstly, the provisions of this regulation must not represent an excessive bureaucratic and financial burden for the companies involved. Secondly, it must not take too long to implement the regulation and therefore to make the data available, so that the policy makers in Europe can be on an equal footing with their US and Japanese counterparts as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The comitology procedure, which has been widely debated within our committee as an alternative to the legislative procedure for the implementation of outward FATS, must be assessed very carefully and in the knowledge that every effort will be needed to fulfil the objective of making uniform data available in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the European Central Bank and other institutions that are particularly in need of adequate statistical information should be involved in the development of common standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Our preparatory talks before today’s debate saw a divergence open up between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We have always tried to reach a compromise that would lead as quickly as possible to the directive being approved at first reading. However, our impression that the Council did not want this text to be approved at first reading prompts us to regard the discussions held in committee on the subject of comitology as an issue that Parliament must bear in mind, particularly when the amendments on comitology are put to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we believe that it is useful and important to recommend that this Chamber vote in favour of the directive. This is an important vote because it will succeed in making our European international trade system focus more carefully on data relating to competitiveness. From the start, our aim has been to have this directive approved at first reading. Beyond its seemingly technical character, this directive has a highly important content that prompts me to suggest to this Chamber that it vote in favour of it as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group is committed to two main points. Firstly, the collection of these statistics is urgent and needs to be as complete as possible, as soon as possible. It is difficult to see how one can conduct meaningful trade negotiations without them. This means that the mandatory collection of statistics on both inward and outward FATS is the best solution. It is amazing to me that apparently some Member States are just not willing to consider providing them. The Council has introduced a derogation for Member States which have not yet tested this process to deal with just those situations in Article 6, point D. Is this not enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Both inward and outward FATS should therefore be collected on a mandatory basis and mandatory pilot studies should be set up for imports and exports. If not, just a few years on Member States that have not volunteered to do pilot studies will claim that it is still not necessary and will still refuse to collect the data.</p>
<p class="contents">My group’s second issue is comitology, which is raising its head yet again. If Parliament’s position on this means that we will have to go to a second reading, so be it. My group will stick with its position on comitology until the Council shows itself to be serious about giving the European Parliament reasonable expectations in this area.

I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for the very precise clarifications that he contributed to this debate, which will certainly help us to reach a solution in time for the vote taking place not in this part-session but in the next.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has already been said about the nature and origin of this debate. Its origins lie in the proposal for a regulation on Community statistics and the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. It has been said here – and reiterated by Mr Purvis – that these statistics provide vital help to national and Community policy-makers to formulate appropriate policy and to help businesses assess ongoing developments in a business world affected by economic globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although voluntary data collection on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates – that is, inward statistics – takes place in virtually all Member States, proving that a concerted procedure is possible, the same cannot be said of outward statistics, which only occurs in a small number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This information is only really useful if it is available promptly and consistently and if data collection is harmonised, hence the need to establish a common framework at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Almunia on the importance of reaching a solution at first reading, although I also agree with Mr Purvis that it would not be a disaster if such an agreement is not obtained at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is a great deal of common ground, as all speakers have said, arising from the pressing and timely nature of the directive itself, there are aspects that we would normally see as upholding the comitology principle rather than the codecision procedure, but which in practice form part of what ought to be Parliament’s role as regards all such procedures, in particular those of a financial nature.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what must be guaranteed. I was somewhat comforted by Mr Almunia’s remarks about the changes pending to the comitology process in order to take into account the importance of Parliament’s role in decision-making and monitoring these processes. It strikes me, however, that it is not entirely guaranteed. I would therefore reiterate that if it is not necessary to reach agreement at first reading, I do not think that is particularly serious given that the most important thing is that we find a sound, properly thought through, common platform from which to implement the regulation in question effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to introduce improvements has also been mentioned, and my group accepts this completely. In this regard, there will not be any difficulties with either the Council or the Commission, as regards the pilot studies or periods of regulation and the deadlines to be observed for obtaining this kind of information.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, anything that helps to make the pilot projects mandatory, to remove from the pilot projects mandatory conclusions and to reduce periods allowed for derogations and the deadlines for establishing definitive data is of vital importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We accordingly endorse the rapporteur’s proposals, the significance of which lies in the fact that they specifically address those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is amply prepared to make full use of the time remaining before the final vote for us to reach an agreement, in the context of bilateral contacts, enabling this report to be adopted at first reading. I repeat, however, that I do not believe that failure to do so will lead to insurmountable obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope that the Council, which at times during this process has struck us as being too insular, will begin to show some openness, along the lines of the openness that came through from the accommodating and significant words of Mr Almunia.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by once again congratulating the rapporteur. The debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was most interesting. Given that the report was adopted unanimously, I feel sure that we will find an appropriate solution to the problem, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the report being debated today in Parliament, drawn up by the rapporteur, Mr Hamon, and discussed by the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to be very timely, since the International Monetary Fund is in the midst of debating its strategic review on the basis of the document presented by its Executive Director.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission does not have any direct or formal presence in the International Monetary Fund, and nor does the European Union. It is the Member States that are represented. But we must bear in mind that the Member States represented in the European Union and this House account for more than 30% of the shareholders in the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This contribution to the debate therefore seems to me to be extremely useful, in terms of how to ensure greater economic and financial stability in the global economy, with the development of the least developed countries and the eradication of poverty included within this notion of stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these objectives, there is no doubt that the assistance of the institutions with the capacity for global action, such as the International Monetary Fund, is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing that strikes us when we analyse the role of the Monetary Fund in the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century is that the objectives set for it when it was created in 1944 are still relevant today.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, while the objectives of promoting international monetary stability — those of facilitating the expansion of international trade, promoting exchange stability and lessening the degree of disequilibrium in balances of payments — are still entirely appropriate, the economic context within which the Fund is operating today is radically different to the context of sixty years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This fact is recognised by the Fund in its strategic review, of course, in which it states that the challenge of globalisation is central to the work entrusted to that institution. The Fund’s new approach is therefore to look at its essential tasks of monitoring and lending within the context of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Fund takes account of both the risks and the opportunities. For example, in its strategic document, it acknowledges that the free movement of capital allows for a more efficient allocation of resources, but at the same time it also points out that it leads to greater volatility and greater risk of extreme reactions by the markets in the event of crisis. It also notes the impetus provided by the emerging economies, which are making a great contribution to the high levels of growth in the world economy, but also notes that the power of these emerging economies is making it more difficult for the poorest countries to jump on the bandwagon of world trade and world growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of globalisation expressed by the Fund in its strategic document; we communicate our views to the International Monetary Fund during the fluid and frequent contacts that we hold with that institution. In particular, as you know, we cooperate with the Monetary Fund in defining our policies and adopting our decisions on the macrofinancial assistance that the European Community gives to countries of the Western Balkans or some of the States that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Macrofinancial assistance, based on the resources of the Community budget, is always linked to a series of conditions that are complementary to the Fund’s interventions in those same countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of development aid and the eradication of poverty, the Monetary Fund, together with the World Bank and the European Union, are undoubtedly the main world players and, in this case, there is also close and productive cooperation between the different institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these aspects are taken up in one way or another in the report that we are debating today, and the Commission is very happy to express its agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur and supported by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also stresses the need to distribute the quotas and voting rights within the Fund’s governing institutions in a manner that reflects the relative weight of the different economies of the member countries in a more balanced manner. This will give the least-developed countries and, in particular, the African countries, a greater voice, since their current quota of representation and capital in the Fund is very low.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Monetary Fund points out in its documents, carrying out this reform of the distribution of quotas and voting rights is the responsibility of the shareholder countries and requires significant political will. It has to be appreciated that to increase some people’s quotas at the expense of others may benefit everybody in the medium and long term because it will allow the Fund to carry out its duties more effectively and fulfil the objectives set for it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, relates to the external representation of the eurozone and of the European Union in economic and monetary matters. I would like to thank the rapporteur and all of the honourable Members who have included this point in the report that we are debating today, though I would like to point out — as I believe I said in this same Chamber last year — that the Commission would prefer a clearer and more direct formulation of the objective of a more appropriate external representation of the eurozone and of the European Union as a whole, such as that proposed in Amendment 5, presented by Mr Purvis, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Presidency of the Eurogroup, the Commission has begun reflecting on how to move towards this more effective external representation of the eurozone and, eventually, of the European Union. Through will and realism, we are trying gradually to draw up a consistent approach that will enable us to make progress towards better coordination amongst the members of the eurozone when it comes to expressing a position in international financial institutions. In the short term, the intention is to identify items in the programmes of these institutions with regard to which the Member States can achieve a coordinated position, such as in the field of budgetary monitoring, for example. In the long term, the objective is still to achieve a single representation for the eurozone in the Fund, which will allow it to exert an influence equivalent to the economic weight of the Monetary Union. To this end, the strong political support of the Member States will undoubtedly be required.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that Parliament can and must make a significant contribution to giving form to this aspiration, expressing its opinion in this regard as clearly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that the Commission is prepared to study how Parliament can participate in the formulation of the positions that the representatives of the eurozone and of the European Union are required to express in international financial bodies and institutions. This issue must be examined. It is not easy to find a way, but, in any event, I can assure all of the honourable Members that the Commission and myself are fully prepared to go further into this issue whenever you see fit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benoît Hamon (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I thank Commissioner Almunia for the favourable welcome he has given my report, which is also the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise a fact that is important enough to be worth pointing out: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted unanimously in favour of this report. I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade, and in particular that of their draftsmen, Mr Wijkman and Mr Bourlanges, who have greatly contributed to improving this report that comes at a time when the International Monetary Fund is reflecting on its strategy and on how to assess the development of its mission, the impact of its policies and the way in which it works.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to the spirit in which the shadow rapporteurs and the entire committee worked to ensure that our Parliament's report makes a useful contribution to the strategic revision of the International Monetary Fund whilst taking account of the major challenges facing the fund: first the issue of its governance, then the issue of its economic doctrine and of the impact of its choices on the Millennium Goals, and finally, more generally, the way in which, through its role of monitoring and crisis prevention, it now continues to guarantee global macroeconomic and financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of governance, let me remind you that the Member States are currently divided into nine constituencies, which means that the European Union, if we can talk about the European Union in this context, has no unified representation. It is thus through these nine fragmented constituencies that the European Union expresses its opinion. It can also be seen - and this point is stressed in the report - that there is little or no coordination between the Member States within the International Monetary Fund. That is why this report advocates, firstly, strengthening coordination between the European seats and, secondly, step-by-step progress towards representation for the European Union as a whole within the International Monetary Fund with, of course, the prospect of a single seat, passing in the meantime via a single seat for the Eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the report does not exactly refer to the issue of the single seat, but sets the objective of ensuring that the European Union is represented and votes as a single block within the International Monetary Fund, which seems to me to be an absolutely vital step. Why is it vital? Because it would give the European Union the blocking minority that it does not currently have, in other words 15% of the voting rights within the International Monetary Fund. The United States are currently the only ones to have a blocking minority, and we know what impact it can have on the major political and strategic choices that the International Monetary Fund has been able to make. That is a very important key element.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that these changes in the European Union's representation may also make it possible to resolve the issue of the distribution of voting rights and thus of the influence of the emerging economies and developing countries within the governing body of the International Monetary Fund. We feel that the representation of the emerging economies should be in better proportion to their economic weight. It is also necessary for the countries with the biggest populations but the smallest economies, in other words the developing countries, to have much greater voting rights than they currently do, for the simple reason that they are the 'beneficiaries' of the International Monetary Fund's policies. That is why the report advocates increasing the number of basic votes: in any event, this is one of the possibilities to explore in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point we are emphasising relates to the issue of the legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund's interventions, particularly when the scope of those interventions is becoming ever wider. We favour improving the transparency of the International Monetary Fund and the way it works. I am thinking in particular of the recruitment of experts and of the need to diversify their profiles, so that they can more easily adapt their recommendations to the diversity of the situations they encounter.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point, which is just as tricky, relates to the way in which we can assess the structural adjustment policies and the International Monetary Fund's recommendations over a number of years. Today, the Fund is much criticised for the implementation of some of its recommendations, for its macroeconomic doctrine and for its rather too strict application of the Washington consensus. That is what led us to call on it to demonstrate greater flexibility and to find the best way of ensuring that the local authorities and countries concerned establish poverty-reduction strategies. This seems to us to be a very important step.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also suggested that some of the Fund's interventions have not been infallible if you look at the results obtained, the social costs of the structural adjustment plans, or the spread, or even reappearance, of crises. We have emphasised these points to encourage the Fund to alter some of its choices as part of its strategic review.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add, and I would like to stress this point, that we must not end up, in terms of world governance, with a kind of implicit hierarchy of standards that tries to place the Fund's recommendations at the pinnacle under the pretext that they affect not only macroeconomic stability and growth policies, but also labour market policies, the funding of social programmes, education and health. We must not end up with this hierarchy of standards placing the Fund's recommendations above all other international organisations, sometimes to the point of producing out-and-out contradictions between the Fund's recommendations and those of the international agreements of the International Labour Organisation or the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we hope that the European Parliament feels more involved, particularly with the prospect of a single representation for the European Union, in the responsibility of the EU's administrators within the International Monetary Fund.

<p class="contents">We have three main concerns. First of all, like the rapporteur, we aspire to better coordination of all development policies. We have put our finger on a contradiction: the International Monetary Fund is a part of a whole, with a specific responsibility, but at the same time it is much more than a part of a whole, because, as the lender of last resort, it has, as Mr Hamon has just mentioned, a sort of <span class="italic">de facto</span> pre-eminence that is not without its problems, resulting in a quest for better coordination with other international organisations, particularly the World Trade Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the World Health Organisation. We need to think carefully about these coordination methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to see a redistribution of powers. We do not want to succumb to an excessive demographic fever that would cut us off from the global economic reality, but we feel that, as it stands, the emerging economies are not adequately represented and that power must be redistributed to those economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we, like the rapporteur, would like Europe to speak with one voice and act as one. It really is distressing to see that Europe, which, across all the Member States, has almost twice as many votes as the United States, counts for so little within the organisation. Can we start moving towards the single seat right now? Probably not, but we do need to start moving towards informal models comparable with shareholder agreements, starting with the Eurozone and with the aim of subsequently getting the whole of the European Union to speak with one voice. Those are our concerns, and I do not think that they contradict Mr Hamon's. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been an interesting and, I hope, ultimately productive example of collaboration between our respective groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group welcomes the IMF’s review of its activities and of its future direction. The Fund has played an important role in the global economy for more than 60 years and we want it to carry on doing so, but to do this it needs to refocus on its core mandate of promoting financial stability and supporting countries with balance of payments difficulties. It has a key role in supervising the world’s monetary system and helping to prevent and deal with crises. Its surveillance role needs to be stepped up to concentrate on reducing global financial instability and advising individual countries about financial stability, economic growth, exchange rates and reserve accumulation, because these are essential preconditions if countries are to avoid and get out of difficulties and poverty traps.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund has been criticised for its conditions when lending to financially stretched countries. I share the concerns that these conditions may have been too rigid at times but, as a responsible lender and custodian of funds, the IMF must be able to impose conditions when lending money. The requirements it sets out are there to improve a country’s economic situation by opening up markets and promoting sensible economic policies, good governance and sound financial management. Often, indeed, the IMF is a useful scapegoat for governments having to force through unpopular reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Europe’s role in the IMF: as Mr Hamon said, the EU is currently spread over nine constituencies – I thought it was ten but perhaps he is right in saying nine – and has lacked any semblance of a cohesive position in setting IMF policy. A first priority, therefore, should be better coordination. There are advantages in being in different constituencies, not least that the EU has greater voting power than any other part of the world and can better influence non-EU countries within these constituencies, but this counts for little if our Member States are at sixes and sevens. A single EU seat is not a realistic goal just now, even if it is an aspiration for the long term, but much more could be achieved right away by better coordination of Member States’ positions.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will submit some amendments and some split votes in order to help improve Mr Hamon’s report which, overall, we hope to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the decision to postpone the vote on this report will provide an opportunity to assess which of the amendments tabled improve the report and which have the opposite effect. Perhaps we can find some compromises in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that this is the right moment for Parliament to have this debate and that this is the right moment for this report, given that a strategic review of the IMF is taking place and the Economic and Financial Committee has produced a paper that will be discussed in the Ecofin Council. For us, too, the role of the IMF in strengthening the stability and solidity of the international financial system is a core issue. However, we should also like to see more focus and attention on social and public policy aspects, and that is why my group retabled some previous amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the constituencies issue and the single seat, both of you have already touched upon how we could strengthen the European voice vis-à-vis other parts of the world. The rapporteur is aware of my own observations on this debate concerning the situation in the Netherlands, in particular, and Belgium, which are in a broader constituency and subject to effects of this kind, but I believe that we could try to find a good formulation on strengthening the European voice and on strengthening the voice of the less-developed countries in the structure in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The other amendment we would draw attention to is that concerning transparency and dialogue with NGOs. Here, the IMF could learn from many other international institutions, including our own European Investment Bank, on how to improve dialogue with, and consultation of, NGOs in their work. It might be important to stress this, as well as the issue of the accountability of EU representatives in the IMF. We see a role for the European Parliament in that as a follow-up to this debate, and we hope that we can agree on finding methods and structures, such as the ad hoc working party proposed in our amendments, to create a follow-up on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an international organisation at the service of capital, which uses it to impose its choices on the peoples whose countries need loans, on the sole pretext of currency stability and balanced development.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Monetary Fund is engaging in political blackmail against the countries which need its loans, by imposing despicable conditions relating to all public policies and cutting public spending, especially on education, health, social protection and every sector which affects a balanced budget. The policy of harsh austerity and the unacceptable social terms imposed on countries which take recourse to it are designed to protect lenders and safeguard their capital, privileges and profits. They are characterised by disdain for the social consequences and provoke a general outcry and mass demonstrations when it meets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not the outcry which results in its strategic review. On the contrary, the International Monetary Fund will acquire an even more aggressive character towards the interests of the workers following a review which will adapt its structure, administration and action, as well as its sectors of direct and indirect intervention in the new reality which emerged from the overturning of the socialist regimes and the new balances between the imperialist centres and the new targets of imperialism, which result in even greater exploitation of the workers and of wealth-generating resources, under the umbrella, of course, of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, in other words Euro-unifying capital, is seeking joint and coordinated participation in the International Monetary Fund, so as to increase its share of influence and profitability, not to change its policy, given that it is promoting a similar policy through capitalist restructurings and the Lisbon Strategy, by commercialising basic grass-roots needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed administrative changes are nothing more than make-up which tries to conceal the truth. Only the fights of the peoples against imperialism and its institutions, against the choices of capital, can bring about changes on the basis of equal relations and mutual benefit, in order to achieve development which will guarantee grass-roots prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom – and I am sure in many other countries – the argument that was used when we first joined and continues to be used is that we are in the EU because we have greater influence in the world if we speak together with one voice. Well, I look at the WTO; I look at trade talks, where already no individual state may speak on her own behalf. What do I see? I see a Hong Kong summit that failed in December, despite the generous offer made by the Americans, and I see a situation where certainly the globe’s third largest trading nation could have done a rather better job for herself.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a single European seat is certainly not going to suit Britain, Denmark, or Sweden. We are not even in the euro. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, 1976 – when we went cap in hand to the IMF – is a dim and distant memory. A single IMF seat is not about economic logic; it is purely about politics. It is purely about turning the European Union into an international superstate. As we heard in one or two of the previous speeches, it is about standing up and forming a bloc to oppose America. The same logic is being applied elsewhere when it comes to the United Nations Security Council. I ask myself – whether it is the United Kingdom, France, Germany or any other country – do we have more influence in the world speaking as 25, speaking with one voice? Or do we have more influence if we are able to put our own opinions forward and speak on behalf of our own people? I know the answer, but I suspect that most people in this House do not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposed European Parliament resolution on the strategy for reviewing the International Monetary Fund is therefore correct in highlighting the role of this international institution in securing financial stability. The draft resolution also correctly points out that this task has not been fully implemented, as a result of a lack of transparent global scrutiny over the standardisation process in the area of financial markets. The full implementation of this task by the International Monetary Fund would undoubtedly have a positive impact on financial market stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing pressures in the financial markets also result from the constantly increasing volume of trading in derivatives, with the United States of America playing a leading role. The volume of trading in derivatives has long since become many times greater than the volume of transfers in the real money sector. Developments in derivatives’ trading may therefore become a time bomb for the world’s financial markets and the world economy as a whole, and I believe that our report should give much more prominence to this issue. For this reason, I am going to support the resolution proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Hamon. I would also like to express my thanks for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this is a story of success. A relative success, like all successes, ladies and gentlemen, but a success nonetheless, in relation too to the functioning of the International Monetary Fund, which has now put the kind of world crises that we have experienced during the history of the developed countries and in the developing countries behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis placed by the International Monetary Fund on macroeconomic stability is fundamental in order to promote equal opportunities for economic development for everybody. Today we see it as essential for economic development to be based on a healthy balance of payments, inflation control and the balancing of budgets in the developing States. These healthy balances of public finances are fundamental to creating climates of confidence and, ultimately, to enabling a State to progress and develop higher levels of well-being and, in turn, to promote economic growth. From that point of view, our report must place clear emphasis on stability.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Union’s presence, we must not forget the problems we are currently facing within the European Union in terms of coordination and, therefore, although in the medium and long term we must move towards a single voice in the Monetary Fund and in other multilateral bodies regulating the world economy, we must be prudent and modest, as Mr Purvis pointed out, bearing in mind that, at the moment, we proceed on the basis of our various countries being represented in different categories.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important, as in the case of Spain, that we stand shoulder to shoulder with much of Central America and Latin America, so that we also take more account of the economic development of a region as essential as Latin America in order to ensure balance in world development and to ensure development and equal opportunities for Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This report therefore offers an opportunity for this Parliament to express its opinion and, in this regard, I hope that we are also working to achieve the greatest possible consensus and that this report will make a positive contribution to defining the role that needs to be played by multilateral bodies in modern economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of them have already been addressed, however, so I restrict myself to talking about two of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to remind the Chamber that on 12 April 2005, Parliament adopted an important resolution, which set out the EU’s role in implementing the Millennium Development Goals. This commitment for the EU to eliminate poverty has been repeated on countless occasions, which, quite apart from being consistent, provides real substance to policies specifically geared towards global development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from this perspective that we should be analysing the own-initiative report by Mr Hamon, which is commendable for the information it provides and for the solutions it proposes for the much needed strategic reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p class="contents">The international community’s concerns and commitments as regards the development goals should also be attributable to the IMF, at least on an instrumental level. The Fund must also undergo a thorough-going transformation of its action towards the indebted countries if it is to make full use of its capacity to meet these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever opinions may have been formed of the IMF since it was set up in 1944, what is indisputable is that it is facing a crisis of legitimacy, firstly relating to the nature and scope of its recommendations and the structural adjustment policies, and secondly relating to the allocation of voting rights and the marginal representation of the emerging countries and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second question, which is that of the European dimension. On this issue I have high hopes. Although I appreciate the difficulties mentioned here of setting up a single representation and a single place immediately, I am very much in favour of a single representation and a single place. This is a political problem mentioned to me in a critical tone by an MEP who had the floor before me. It is actually a matter of choice and a political problem that lies within the EU itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the EU that needs first to pave the way for conciliation and coordination if it is to deserve this position of single representation in the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I know without fear of contradiction: a single, coherent, audible European voice in the IMF is an essential prerequisite for a genuine cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the thrust of Mr Hamon’s message, and he has my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share most of the views expressed in it. The report contains an in itself unobtrusive, but nonetheless clear, criticism of the International Monetary Fund’s structural programme and of the conditions imposed on recipient countries. Such criticism is crucial because this policy has, in actual fact, exacerbated poverty and increased social problems in many countries. It is therefore vital that the issues highlighted by the report, namely the fight against poverty and the need to achieve the Millennium Goals, be incorporated as overarching objectives of IMF policy. In the longer term, this type of institution ought no doubt to be a part of the UN system and of a coherent development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also join in the criticism of the lack of democracy in the IMF. What is crucial in this area is that the developing countries should have more power, and what is perhaps most important in this respect is their need to be given a fairer share of the votes when decisions are taken. Democratisation must, however, also mean that a developing country can be given the Managing Directorship. This post should not go automatically to one or other of the richest countries. Democratic control within the EU should also increase, but it should be exercised by the national parliaments. I do not think it would be fair to transfer power over IMF policy to the EU institutions, and I am therefore opposed to Amendment 5. I believe that policy within the World Trade Organisation is a shocking example of a lack of democratic control over EU policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, there has been a prevailing tendency to place undue confidence in deregulation and free currency speculation. The majority of monetary movements are now downright speculative. If macroeconomic stability is to be achieved, there is a need for self-protection against these trends, at both national and international levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled an amendment of our own which is, I suppose, in keeping with the demands for increased democracy in the IMF and through which we wish to increase scrutiny, and we hope that it will be adopted. We shall vote against the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but in favour of most of the proposals by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We tend to prefer euphemisms and diplomatic niceties, but today I will venture to call a spade a spade. The report before us is basically a scathing criticism of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Parliament has the opportunity to say what critics of the Fund have been saying for years. The report rightly highlights the fact that, I quote, ‘the stabilisation policies implemented by the IMF have not always achieved the objectives hoped for and whereas stabilising economies too suddenly is likely to result in undesirable social adjustments’. We also agree that, I quote, ‘the monitoring of these programmes should be the subject of transparent democratic supervision’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund sometimes acts as if it were operating in the middle of the jungle, though it is a jungle whose rules it has itself created.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of conditions poor countries have to comply with in order to obtain assistance has been growing year on year. An example is the absurd situation that sub-Saharan African countries find themselves in, where they have to fulfil an average of 114 conditions in order to have access to funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has rightly emphasised the need to set up new financial tools. The Fund has too many priorities when it comes to reducing the debt of the poorest states. The IMF has to go back to its original role. Its main aim used to be global exchange rate stability, and this should still be the case today, as a previous speaker mentioned a short while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Hanon is right to state that the increase in the Fund’s tasks has not been accompanied by any significant reform of its management. We are therefore entitled to demand enhancement of the Fund’s legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur quite correctly points out that the Fund, and I quote, ‘has sometimes failed to prevent crises from becoming infectious and recurring’.</p>
<p class="contents">We wholeheartedly agree with the criticisms levelled at the Fund. We agree that its policy fails to take account of the fact that inflation is not the only economic problem facing developing countries, and that the Fund should focus on achieving macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Finally, we are pleased with the conclusions drawn in the report, namely that macroeconomic stability is not at odds with the fair distribution of growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would emphasise the importance of the discussion that is taking place and that, it is hoped, will end at the Fund’s Assembly in Singapore, in September, with a new distribution of quotas which, in turn, will be linked to a new distribution of voting rights and hence to the governance of the Fund, which is something that can be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important for the European voice to cooperate in establishing a clear approach to improving the governance of the Fund and the representation of the different States in the Fund’s governing institutions, in accordance with fair criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise the importance — and I believe that the huge majority of you will agree with me — of greater coordination of the countries of the European Union in terms of the positions taken by the European Member States in the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the coordination of economic policies to progress, if we want there to be greater integration amongst the different Member States in the internal market and in the Economic and Monetary Union and if we want Europe’s external influence also to have an economic dimension, it is important that the European Union’s external economic dimension is also reflected in the deliberations and discussions of the Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament’s role with regard to the Monetary Fund will progress as we move forward with the coordination of the European voice in the Fund’s institutions, until eventually — I am convinced that we will get there, though not in the short term — we have a single voice and single representation for the countries of the European single currency in the Monetary Fund. This will not happen today, or tomorrow, but it is a direction that I believe to be both inevitable and desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall add finally that reference has been made — and I share this concern — to the need for the Monetary Fund to act in coordination with the strategies also set out in other fields by multilateral organisations and, in particular, by the organisations of the United Nations system.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must be pleased that the Monetary Fund is involved in and committed to the achievement of the Millennium Goals. Achieving these is one of the international community’s fundamental objectives. I believe that the Fund’s involvement and commitment, which would perhaps have been difficult to imagine fifteen years ago, are today a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU countries are represented individually or as members of nine of these groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nordic Group consists of the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and thus includes countries such as Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The IMF’s role has changed since the organisation was founded immediately after the Second World War. Operating within a system of fixed exchange rates, its main tasks from the beginning were both to help countries with balance of payments problems temporarily to fund deficits in the balance of current payments and to check that the countries concerned were taking good care of their economies. It was also important that the countries did not devalue their currencies in order to become more competitive. Nowadays, the eurocountries, armed with their European Central Bank, have approximately the same role as the IMF. The eurocountries have fixed exchange rates. Possible concessional credits to eurocountries that end up in financial crises need to be handled within the group of eurocountries.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries outside the eurozone have fluctuating exchange rates and do not therefore end up with balance of payments problems. They also have better control of their debt ratios. It would be natural for the eurocountries to form a common group in the IMF, with one headquarters. EU countries outside the eurozone should not be part of the group. Nor is there any reason for Sweden to form part of a common EU group. If it were, we should also lose our ability actively to influence the IMF’s relations with the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title21"></a><a name="creitem21"></a>

Therefore, I support the resolution and the opinion that we must declare our position on the destruction of cultural heritage in Azerbaijan. In conflicts such as the one between Azerbaijan and Armenia, it is difficult to blame only one side. Cultural monuments there are being destroyed as a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which in 18 years has claimed the lives of 25 000 people and made a million inhabitants refugees. Neither aggression, provocation from one side or the other nor the desecration of cultural heritage will help to unravel this entrenched conflict. Only if the sides seek negotiations, find a common political language and show good will, with the aim of drawing closer to the European Union, can the flames be put out. According to recent surveys, a large proportion of the populations in both states want to bring the conflict under control as soon as possible. Those states, which want to play an active role in the European Union's Neighbourhood Policy, simply must protect the cultural heritage of minorities appropriately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Azerbaijani Government claimed the video footage documenting this is fraudulent Armenian propaganda. But I have received independent verification that the footage is genuine from a British architect, Steven Sim, an expert in the region. Furthermore, if there has been no destruction, why are on-site visits refused by the Azerbaijanis, who also, rather bizarrely, state that this could have been done by looters needing the stone for local building work?</p>
<p class="contents">Once more Mr Sim has stated that passage into the cemetery requires passing through Azerbaijani army-controlled territory, making such a thing almost impossible without official support and in clear breach of their duty of care to protect the site.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been informed by the Azerbaijani Embassy that this destruction is nothing compared to the destruction of Azerbaijani mosques. I was indeed sent photos of destroyed mosques. That mosques in the war zone were destroyed in 1991 is undeniable and to be condemned without reservation, but the photos I was sent I believe represent destruction that took place 15 years ago, not 3 months ago. Furthermore, the Julfa site in Nakhichevan was never part of the war zone. Also, it is worth pointing out that I have been informed that the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have recently agreed to a project for the reconstruction of mosques destroyed on their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at a critical juncture in the talks between the two Presidents, Kocharyan and Aliyev, in Rambouillet, France, on finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. I therefore believe that any further planned destruction of Armenian heritage will not be conducive to lasting peace in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would appreciate it if you would allow me to relate a personal anecdote. When I went to Armenia a few years ago and saw all those monuments and churches which have survived to this day since the early Middle Ages, I was reminded of my earlier visit to Spain, at the other end of the Christian world, a thousand kilometres to the west. I was impressed by how similar the monuments in these two regions were.</p>
<p class="contents">They were all monuments of early medieval culture. We are responsible for all the monuments in the world. Nonetheless those European monuments which bear witness to the cultural past and unity of Europe ought to be particularly dear to us, be they located in the remote eastern part of Armenia, the western borders of Spain or anywhere in between.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the events we are witnessing now are particularly distressing because the monuments being destroyed are more than just part of Europe’s heritage. They belong to the whole world. Azerbaijan’s responsibility is particularly clear. As Mr Tannock mentioned earlier, why does Azerbaijan not allow anyone to visit these places and assess the extent of the damage on site? Fortunately, we do know what happened as a result of barbaric decisions made by those in power in the region, and we have evidence of the damage on film.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution must be passed and then we must monitor what happens next. The steps to be taken cannot be limited to words, however noble they may be. Words must be followed by actions and we expect Azerbaijan to take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aware that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is currently on an official visit to the region, but I would particularly like to launch an appeal to parliamentarians and an appeal to responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the European Union is negotiating action plans with each of the countries to promote the stability of the region, Armenia and Azerbaijan have entered a delicate, but hopeful, phase of peace negotiations regarding the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Presidents Aliev and Kocharian met last Sunday at Rambouillet, under the aegis of the OSCE Minsk group. The success of the process is the top priority, because it could indirectly lead to a resolution to the other conflicts in the region. It is thus a vital precondition to the general stabilisation of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, ladies and gentlemen, do you really think, in your heart of hearts, that now is the time to throw oil on the fire by deleting, as the amendments propose, the sections that quite rightly allow a balanced approach to the joint resolution that we all negotiated together the day before yesterday? We have already condemned the destruction of the cemetery in Julfa, in Mr Tannock's report from January, and we continue to condemn it. However, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot leave out the global context of the frozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has been responsible for thousands of deaths and refugees; the wounds are still raw. Can we also ignore the fact that 20% of Azerbaijan's territory is considered by Armenia to be a buffer zone for Nagorno-Karabakh and that various elements of the cultural and religious heritage of these occupied territories have also been destroyed? It is high time to stop this dangerous escalation. It would be irresponsible to deny the shared responsibility of the parties to a conflict and to refer only to the destruction caused by one side, and it would also be contrary to our commitment to support our Armenian and Azerbaijani friends in the desire to resolve their differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this resolution comes at a time of increased tensions between the Muslim world and the western world. A weak text could reduce these events to a simple clash between the Christian and Muslim worlds. I therefore ask you not to give arguments to the extremists of all sides by voting for a resolution which, if it were amended in line with certain proposals, would be unfairly partisan. It is a question of personal conscience, but it is also the credibility of the European Parliament and, more broadly, the activities of the European Union in the region that are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was not until the 1920s that the three peoples were separated from one another administratively, each with their own territory. While this was necessary to secure peace, development and stability, it did mean that mixed areas had to be allocated to one of the groups that were involved in the conflicts. We can now see the effects this has had in minority areas South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and, above all, in Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan, which are subject to both Armenian and Azerbaijani influences.</p>
<p class="contents">The temptation is considerable not only to drive out from those areas the people who belong to the neighbouring peoples, but also to destroy their historical buildings, places of prayer and burial and wipe out their memories for ever. Now that there is no longer an overarching Soviet Union that could deal with such excrescences, it has become even more critical that the rest of Europe should help to ensure that the neighbouring peoples coexist in peace and mutual respect in what are now independent states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cemetery bears witness to the history of a region where, until the first quarter of the 20th century, more than 80% of the inhabitants were Armenian. This site was abandoned in the Soviet era and, in 1998, the local authorities started to destroy it. At that time, UNESCO was very disturbed by this, which resulted in a temporary halt to the work of the bulldozers. UNESCO also contacted the competent authorities to protect this heritage, because the damage caused to this memorial site was very serious.</p>

Armenia, which has a population of 4 million, has been Christian since 301 AD, making it the first Christian country in the world. This fact is supported not only by historical documents but also by the thousands of crosses carved onto stone tablets, called <span class="italic">khatchkars,</span> which have been destroyed, just as other Armenian cultural treasures have been destroyed in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">khatchkars</span>, which are literally stone crosses between 0.5 and 3.5 metres high, were made of basalt. They were placed on a cuboidal base and the front of the stone, which bore the image of the cross, was positioned to point west. The Armenians saw the <span class="italic">khatchkars</span> as a protective power that would shield them from natural disasters. These structures were erected to commemorate important events they featured as compositional elements in sacred buildings and were also used as tombstones, always placed at the feet of the deceased.</p>
<p class="contents">A cemetery in Djulfa was destroyed recently. The cemetery dated back to the Middle Ages and was located in the region controlled by Azerbaijan. The scandalous process of devastation and destruction of Armenian cultural monuments began in 1998, when 800 of the stone crosses I described were destroyed. Although this process of destruction was temporarily halted following protests by UNESCO, it resumed in 2002. It is probable that the reprehensible destruction of Armenian cultural heritage is being carried out with the consent of the government of Azerbaijan, which sent special army units to destroy the stones bearing Armenian crosses.</p>
<p class="contents">Armenians have been persecuted for centuries. They have suffered as a result of war, aggression and occupation. They are a nation with a wealth of experience, both as a nation and as a Christian people. The Azeris have experienced destruction and suffering too, but it must be emphasised that no conflict can justify the destruction of cultural heritage, which is a common legacy for the whole of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture is an expression of communication between people, of shared thoughts and actions. It is a confirmation of humanity and a fundamental common legacy for communities. We therefore call for respect for our global common legacy, irrespective of religion and origin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the destruction caused to the cemetery at Djulfa casts a shadow on the country’s commitments as a member of the Council of Europe. Twelve years after the main conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, the position of the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan is still very unstable, especially as far as respect for its cultural heritage is concerned. The destruction of the cemetery at Djulfa can be compared, for example, to the Taleban’s destruction of the pillars depicting the Buddha in Afghanistan. It is a matter of respect for the past and for the history of the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">What can condemnation of the events lead to? We still hope that an impartial agency can inspect the destruction at the cemetery in Djulfa and that the gravestones that remain can be repaired. We also hope that protest will help prevent the future destruction of cultural heritage. The devastation caused to the cemetery at Djulfa is a crime against people’s heritage and, as such, is to be condemned. The destruction of these unique Christian artefacts constitutes an irreplaceable loss for mankind.</p>

The Commission has been informed about the alleged destruction of artefacts in the Julfa Cemetery, in the Azerbaijani Autonomous Republic of Nakhichevan. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan delivered a statement at the 586th Meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council of 22 December 2005 and the issue was also discussed in the Council of Europe on 1 February 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of World Cultural Heritage sites in third countries is not within the Commission’s competences. We understand, however, that Armenia appealed to UNESCO, asking for a mission to be sent to Nakhichevan as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the fact that episodes like the destruction in the Julfa Cemetery, if confirmed by independent sources, have a direct link with and are symptomatic of the long-standing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which has caused mistrust and destruction and claimed victims on both the Armenian and the Azerbaijani sides since the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to persuade the parties to find a quick settlement to the conflict and, once a peace deal is hopefully reached, assist in the reconstruction and the rehabilitation of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh particularly unacceptable today in that both Armenia and Azerbaijan are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which aims, as a priority, to build confidence in the South Caucasus region, encouraging regional cooperation in as many sectors as possible and contributing to peace, stability and prosperity at the borders of an enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an ambitious objective that we will try to achieve, including through the implementation of the action plans that the Commission is currently discussing with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. In these documents we ask the three South Caucasus countries to undertake a number of steps in order to come closer to Europe. The documents cover a very wide range of subjects, including cooperation on education and culture and the protection of cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of the ENP action plans will be monitored closely by the Commission and the benefits which flow from these will of course be conditional on their achievements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The deaths of many leading figures and ordinary people have gone without investigation. The tragedy and misery have been compounded by last year’s tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a real chance to restart. I hope that all those involved in the peace talks will appreciate how important these are, recognise their responsibilities and be prepared to compromise and not look for recriminations. Nobody in Sri Lanka would benefit from a return to conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally I regret the absence of representatives of the Muslims, Buddhists and Colonel Karuna’s forces there, which I believe will make things more difficult. The ban on the LTTE people travelling to the European Union makes it rather anomalous that we have to have these talks in either Geneva or Norway. Nevertheless, we in the European Parliament should do everything we can, with the Commission and the Council, to assist, not hinder, the negotiations.</p>

<p class="contents">It is for that reason that the country has been in the grip of war for many years, with parts of it not under government control; plans for self-government from the North-East ended up not being implemented, and foreign mediation does not lead anywhere. Norway, in particular, has invested much energy in this, and its former mediator is now Norway’s Foreign Minister. It looks like the outside world is resigning itself to this problem never being resolved, to the endless continuation of the violence, which will leave much devastation and casualties in its wake, so that some of the country’s inhabitants will leave and seek refuge elsewhere.</p>

<p class="contents">When we discussed Azerbaijan, we spoke about human rights in a very specific context – a cultural context. Culture is an important element of human rights. The situation is far more dramatic in the case of Sri Lanka. We really cannot wait for peace to be established there. On the one hand, we could remind ourselves of the old saying according to which nations pay for the madness of their leaders, and simply state that the blame lies with those who are behind the conflict rather than with the people of Sri Lanka, who are longing for peace. On the other hand, however, we are faced with a situation that is not uncommon across the world. There are the indigenous inhabitants and the later arrivals. The conflict between the indigenous Singhalese and the later arrivals, the Tamils, has significantly deeper historical roots. We may think today that we can forget about history and speak only of the future, but this is simply not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to understand the feelings of humiliation experienced by the indigenous inhabitants who believe that they have more rights than those who arrived later and uninvited. These newcomers did not arrive as a result of any decisions made by the Singhalese. They appeared because of decisions taken elsewhere. That is what happened in Sri Lanka. Let us, therefore, try to ensure that peace is established as soon as possible and that the people of Sri Lanka cease to pay for the madness of those in power. However, we must take into consideration the fact that a historical right to power is the same right as the right to property of someone who has been deprived of that property.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the European Union will do all in its power to ensure that peace is achieved in Sri Lanka. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know the reason we wanted to postpone it was because of the scheduled meeting between the Sri Lankan Government and LTTE in Geneva on 22-23 February.</p>
<p class="contents">I, along with everybody else, sincerely hope the talks will be successful. It will be a small step in the right direction if they are. That should improve the implementation of the ceasefire, which, as we all know, is not observed fully by either the Tamil Tigers or the government. We still see a lot of recruitment of child soldiers, which is an absolute scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to achieve a permanent political solution, it is important that we do not just look at the security issues. However, any talks that take place on a political solution must involve the Muslims and other Tamil organisations, as well as the government and the Tamil Tigers. Only by doing that can we have a clear way forward to a permanent solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three years have passed since the last talks and, for the sake of all the people of Sri Lanka, it is vitally important that violence should cease and that there should be real progress in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that it would be helpful for this Parliament to express its views formally at this sensitive moment, so we have agreed with other political groups that there should be no resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Sri Lanka has suffered from an upsurge of violence since December 2005, which has claimed over 200 lives. Not surprisingly, there has been a breakdown in trust between the Government and the LTTE, which is impeding political progress and economic recovery. We note with concern that even the unarmed observers comprising the Sri Lankan monitoring mission have come under attack on many occasions during this period. Although the Sri Lankan Government has shown restraint in its response so far, both sides must refrain from acts of violence and dedicate themselves to the impending negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">For peace and stability to return to Sri Lanka, the Government and the LTTE must be prepared to make compromises. A useful confidence-building measure would be for both sides to cease the use of anti-personnel landmines and to assist in their removal. To this end, the Sri Lankan Government should set an example by signing the Ottawa Convention, and the LTTE should sign the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment. Such a gesture of good will would verify their commitment to peace and could lay the foundations for further mutually beneficial initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and individual Member States can take action to facilitate the peace process. European countries should monitor the financial support provided by their Tamil communities to ensure that it is not being used by persons or for activities that undermine the already fragile ceasefire agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 2002 ceasefire has been broken many times, hundreds of people have been killed over the last two years and there are thousands of internally displaced people. Kidnaps, torture and other kinds of abuse are still taking place, and the expectations created following the tsunami of December 2004 that that tragedy might help in tackling the internal conflict constructively have been dashed repeatedly. Furthermore, none of the mechanisms for investigating human rights appears to have been implemented satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, we should be glad about the Norwegian authorities’ determination to promote a peace process in such difficult circumstances. This peace process can teach us a new lesson in how important it is to invest in building peace, rather than stirring up war.</p>
<p class="contents">If we analyse Europe’s investments in recent times, not just in Sri Lanka but in the region in general, we shall see that we have invested a lot in stirring up war and much less — very little in fact — in building and promoting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that these talks next week – and I certainly hope that they will lead not just to a peace process, but to a process of creating a fair and lasting peace – will offer a genuine opportunity that can be copied in other models and that can be assimilated into other peace processes, above all putting into practice what Mrs Lynne has said: all of the actors involved in the conflict must be included; nobody can be excluded, not even those who are considered to be the greatest enemies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The local community, mainly made up of women and children, is the victim of uncontrolled and brutal violence. Murders, and the involvement of military forces in these killings are becoming part of the reality of everyday life in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">The cease fire agreement reached in 2002 is currently under serious threat, and a new conflict may well erupt. Sri Lanka needs significant international support to guarantee a stable cease fire, which is essential in order for any progress to be made in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should support Sri Lanka in all its efforts to achieve stability, peace and democracy. Combating any kind of racial or ethnic discrimination should be made a priority. Discrimination affects the local community on a daily basis and is an obstacle to obtaining just compensation, especially for the victims of the tsunami.</p>

I am very glad to see that the Norwegian Government has taken the initiative in setting these negotiations in motion; it is very interesting that it should be Norway that does this and not the European Union. The fact is that there is a quite fundamental problem, in that these conversations cannot take place in a European Union context because of the EU’s so-called list of terrorist bodies, which includes the LTTE, so those in charge of the negotiations cannot even enter the EU. That goes to show just how absurd this list of terrorist bodies is, which I believe is very often used as a means of taking action against political undesirables.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, let me state that the Commission is continuing to follow the situation in Sri Lanka very closely and we welcome the interest shown by European Parliament political groups in the resolutions calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict for the people of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to hold talks in Geneva on 22 and 23 February, with a view to reinforcing and improving the implementation of the ceasefire agreement concluded in February 2002. We congratulate the Norwegian Minister, Erik Solheim, for his tireless efforts and reiterate our full support for him and for Norway’s role as facilitator in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the situation in Sri Lanka, although violence appears to have declined since the announcement of the Geneva talks on 25 January, we are extremely concerned by the escalation of violence in the past few months. Over 200 people were killed between the election of the new president in November 2005 and the end of January 2006. The European Union has expressed its grave concern about the continuing violence in Sri Lanka and urged all those engaged in violence and those with influence on them to put an end to it and stop the descent into conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2005 and the early part of 2006 were bad periods for the peace process, with the failure of the P-TOMS, the assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar and the electoral boycott imposed in parts of the north and east. We therefore welcome the Geneva talks as an important step, which we hope will help stabilise the situation in Sri Lanka and lead to the long hoped for peaceful resolution of the bitter conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the comments made about the tsunami funds, we have started delivering tsunami reconstruction, despite the failure of the P-TOMS. The Commission allocated tsunami victims in Sri Lanka EUR 5.5 million of assistance to revitalise livelihoods in the north and east and provide affected communities there with basic economic opportunities. That comes on top of a large EC assistance programme already running in the north and the east.</p>
<p class="contents">What we expected from P-TOMS was to move to a full reconstruction process where the government, the LTTE and the Muslim community would agree on priorities and projects. We had put all our weight behind P-TOMS and had earmarked EUR 50 million to go through the mechanism. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner made that public in March 2005 in Colombo, where we pressed very hard for a quick agreement. We still consider that that was the right thing to do. If P-TOMS had come to life, we would have reversed the negative trend in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, we should not forget that the Commission, through its Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid, has provided more than EUR 23 million to victims of the conflict in the north and east since the peace process began, and over EUR 40 million of aid to tsunami victims. A large part of that aid has been directed at linking humanitarian aid to the reconstruction effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is it not time that we spelled it out that this military base must be closed down, and Guantanamo Bay handed back to Cuba? The reports that reach us from the American prisoner of war camp there are horrific. Over 500 prisoners are still being held there without trial and without due process, and they are on the receiving end of gross mistreatment and torture. Guantanamo is a lawless place. The torture that goes on there must be brought to an end, with those responsible for it and those who carry it out ending up in the dock of a court of law. Let us be quite clear about the fact that the closure of Guantanamo is being called for by a wide range of people, one of them being the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel. At the same time, though, her Minister of the Interior can say that ‘If I am rightly informed, one person has been interviewed in Guantanamo by the German authorities.’ It is evident that Germany or other EU Member States are benefiting from what goes on there. Now really is the time for the European Union to abandon its double standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mrs Merkel for addressing that issue very forthrightly when she met President Bush. The simple fact is that the war on terror, which is vital and which we support, can be waged only on the basis of law. If certain parties were to get the message across to the world that, ultimately, the strongest get their way, the effect would be catastrophic, for everyone would aspire only to be the strongest, and the law of the jungle would again hold sway.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that war, even against the greatest of evils, can be waged only on the basis of law, on the basis of human rights and of international law, with all the determination and single-mindedness that it demands, and these are dependent on strict adherence to the common values and shared convictions of the Western alliance and of the European Union, of which there is certainly no evidence in Guantanamo. All I can do, then, is to urge President Bush to close Guantanamo down as quickly as possible and hand the prisoners over to a proper legal authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But they could equally be the words of all right-thinking citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Guantánamo Bay has become a byword for all that is wrong with the US response to terrorism today. Four years after the first prisoners arrived, not one has received a proper trial and 500 remain in confinement, the vast majority without charge or due legal process. Just today, the United Nations has published a report which suggests that the treatment of detainees meets the definition of torture under the UN Convention against Torture. The authors conclude that the US Government should either expeditiously bring the detainees to trial, or release them without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">We would go further. We agree with the Amnesty International Director in the UK that there is no middle ground regarding Guantánamo: it must be closed. That is why my group will support this resolution to call on the US authorities to close Guantánamo Bay and to release the prisoners or try them in accordance with international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the list of issues to be discussed would be extremely long, I am at least pleased to have the opportunity to analyse one of the most shameful blights on humanity and, in particular, on our times: Guantánamo.</p>
<p class="contents">After four years, the approximately five hundred people currently detained in Guantánamo do not enjoy the minimum legal guarantees required in a democracy that respects the rule of law and the international rules on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot continue to be an accomplice, through its silence, in the maintenance of what in reality is quite simply a torture centre, and one in which the death penalty is applied in an arbitrary manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of Guantánamo represents an enormous stain on the history not just of the United States but of all those on the outside who keep quiet and tolerate the base. And it increases even further the image of an imperialist and war-mongering nation that has absolutely no respect for the very rights and freedoms that the current US Administration claims to defend throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no justification for Guantánamo’s existence, therefore, and less still on the grounds of the fight against terrorism. I am therefore delighted that this Parliament has finally had the courage to call for the closure of Guantánamo in such a unanimous fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">It now only remains for me to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that we must take a further step, that our work must be complete and that we must call soon for a thorough investigation of what is happening in relation to the occupation of Iraq. In particular, we must condemn the events in Abu Ghraib. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the European Union is to demand of states that they adhere to human rights, then it must do so globally and credibly. Neither human rights nor international humanitarian law are negotiable, and that is something we have to spell out to our American allies, with whom, after all, we share democratic values. I really do find it disturbing that this has to become a cause of dispute with the United States, for it is our ally, but that is the difference between them and the other parts of the world in which we call for respect for human rights. It is fortunate, and encouraging, that the USA is a democratic and open society, and that the same debate is going on there. I think that the majority of Americans would agree with us that one cannot, in these matters, simply suspend the rule of law. It is vitally important that we hold on to the moral high ground if we are to be credible in combating terrorism in other parts of the world and take up the cause of democracy. It is not acceptable that we should turn and look in the other direction, especially in our dealings with this great ally of ours, alongside which, in other parts of the world – in Afghanistan, for example – we are promoting democracy and human rights. It is worth considering the political and moral predicament in which we would find ourselves if we were to keep silent about Guantanamo, when we would no longer be able to maintain any credibility in our dealings with those states where we are trying to promote human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is right to call for this camp to be closed down and for those who are held there to be brought before a regular court. We may well not have put it in such explicit terms, but the conclusion must be drawn that, in the absence of proof against them, these people must be set at liberty, dangerous though that may be in individual cases. Here, too, the rule applies that the accused is given the benefit of the doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment are gross breaches of the Geneva Conventions. It surely must, at long last, dawn on the Bush administration just how cynical and wrong this behaviour in the fight against terrorism actually is. The effective combating of terrorism demands that one works to persuade the world at large and stresses the importance of international law, by which the arbitrary killing of civilians is prohibited. It is that law that the Bush administration is disregarding, not only in Guantanamo, but also elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any form of human rights in Guantánamo is conspicuous by its absence, and the whole set-up is, from beginning to end, redolent not of human rights, but of human errors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of a single Presidency, the United States has gone from being a country that most people want to visit, trade with and otherwise engage with to being a country that many avoid. Guantánamo may be situated on a military base in Cuba, but it is a cowardly attempt by the United States to avoid its own laws. We desire nothing more than that the United States observe its own Constitution and that the UN conventions be complied with. In both respects, Guantánamo is an absurdity. The Bush regime is acting like a bunch of old-fashioned, high-handed colonial masters when it comes to the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, Abu Graib, the war against the Iraqi people and a list of conventions concerning everything from the fight against tobacco to the right to food.</p>
<p class="contents">These departures from international cooperation and international law damage the American people and the world in general. The Guantánamo prisoners are not alone in suffering oppression by the Bush regime, even if they are the ones who are suffering the most. We also have sympathy for the majority of Americans who have never supported the Bush regime and who are victims of its arbitrary procedures. These ordinary people are badly affected by the hatred and threats emanating from the world around them. The Bush regime could make a start on doing penance by closing Guantánamo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be acknowledged that a similar resolution is required to commemorate 27th January. You are surely aware that this is the International Day for Prevention of Crimes Against Humanity. Naturally, we shall agree that a country which tortures prisoners in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo on the say-so of its President has no right to ask for cooperation from the EU on military actions launched unilaterally. The time has come to announce sanctions against the United States for its failure to respect human rights. This is a position that we broadly accepted this week when we adopted the report on the human rights and democracy clause in European agreements. Perhaps you do not remember this, or perhaps the argument of the military power in question is too strong. This is of course a matter of double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that once the Resolution, which has my full backing, has been adopted, it should be followed up by a proposal to indict those who, in Guantanámo and Abú Ghrajb, have taken part in acts that contravene the laws of the United States, and are in breach of human rights and international agreements. I should therefore like to suggest that the Commission set up an international criminal court to try these criminals. I also feel it important to recommend that the country holding the Presidency should call on the UN Security Council to table a resolution demanding sanctions against the United States. And incidentally, we are all certainly aware that the US base at Guantánamo Bay has for a number of years been occupied against the wishes of the legitimate government of the Republic of Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the Second World War, we developed these humanitarian principles. In Europe, we have a European, Strasbourg system for protecting human rights and finally we, in the European Union, have a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will be, and indeed already is, part of the European Constitution. All of these documents state clearly and unequivocally that human dignity must be respected, that no human being should be humiliated, threatened or persecuted, that no one should be held without trial, and that everyone has the right to defence.</p>

The global fight against terrorism on an unprecedented scale has created new challenges for the protection of human rights. The Commission constantly underlines that the fight against terrorism must be conditional on maintaining respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the situation of some 500 individuals who are being detained in Guantanámo Bay, although the Commission does not have competence to intervene on behalf of these detainees, we are following all developments closely. The Member States have also voiced concern bilaterally to the US regarding the treatment of their nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to emphasise that all anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with international humanitarian law and international human rights law. It is our firm belief that the Geneva Conventions apply to all persons captured on the field of battle. So far as continued detention in Guantanámo Bay is concerned, according to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, there are absolute rights which are to be respected in all circumstances, such as the right not to be tortured or to be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we welcome the recent amendment to the Defence Appropriations Bill introduced by Senator McCain, which puts beyond doubt the fact that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment applies to persons held in US custody worldwide. Moreover, in our view, every person who has been detained must have some status under international law and is entitled not to be detained arbitrarily and to receive due process and a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also made clear its support for the request by United Nations Special Rapporteurs to visit Guantanámo Bay and to be able to interview detainees in private. The European Union has raised this issue repeatedly with the United States and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some of the interventions, the Commission has repeatedly made clear to the United States that the European Union is firmly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. I would also like to say that the report by the UN Special Rapporteurs which was published yesterday is being studied by the Commission with a view to taking this issue up again with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the international community seeks to reassert full adherence to international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards, in relation to the alleged Taliban and al-Qa’ida members in Guantanámo and elsewhere. It is only by ensuring respect for those values by all parties that real progress will be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The coordination of social security systems and the transferability of pensions entitlements are the subject of a recently amended regulation, as well as of a proposal for a directive which is currently being examined by the departments of the Council that deal with the preparation of legislation.</p>
<p>As regards social security benefits, the honourable Member will no doubt be aware that the new regulation on the coordination of social security systems (Regulation No 883/2004/EC), which will enter into effect simultaneously with the appendant Implementing Regulation, will replace Regulation No 1408/71/EC, which is currently applicable. The intention is that the new regulation should, as a legal instrument in the field of mobility between Member States, be more uniform in its application, easier to transpose and more contemporary in its approach, thereby helping not only to improve the insured persons’ entitlements to social security, but also to simplify the procedures involved.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will no doubt also be aware that the proposal recently presented by the Commission for a directive improving the portability of supplementary pension rights is aimed at making employees more mobile and improving job mobility overall, by enabling mobile workers, right up to the end of their working lives, to acquire sufficient supplementary pension rights. This proposal resulted from consultations at European level, lasting over a period of years, on the need for improvements in the functioning of additional pension systems and the means whereby these may best be achieved.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has rightly observed, one of the major hindrances to people who want to work or study in another EU Member State, or, indeed, to transfer from one part of the labour market to another, is that their qualifications and skills may well not be recognised. The explicit goal of Community policy is that these obstacles be removed, and recent years have seen various Community instruments introduced and initiatives taken with a view to making the transfer of academic and professional qualifications easier. It should however be borne in mind that this is a step-by-step process, and one moreover subject to Article 149 of the Treaty, which states that the goals of Community action in the field of education include ‘encouraging the academic recognition of diplomas and periods of study’. This process is, inevitably, a matter of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>As regards academic qualifications, the national academic recognition information centres (NARIC) provide relevant information on the recognition of diplomas and study periods abroad, and positive contributions are also being made by the European Credit Transfer System and the recently introduced Diploma Supplement.</p>
<p>As regards professional qualifications, a network of national contact points was set up in the Member States to be the first port of call for questions concerning them. In parallel with the Diploma Supplement, which relates to university education, the certificate supplement was devised to meet the needs of professional qualifications, and, at the same time, a common European model for curricula vitae was proposed with the aim of making it possible to set out an individual’s qualifications and skills in a simple and effective way. Since then, another instrument has been adopted in the shape of what is termed the Europass, which helps to promote mobility in work-linked training and apprenticeship by facilitating a voluntary and Europe-wide system for accounting for periods of education and training outside the ‘home’ Member State.</p>
<p>There is increasing acknowledgment of the benefits of informal education, to which the honourable Member referred, and initiatives in the fields of education and youth are being used to encourage Member States to develop the machinery for this type of learning to be recognised. It was in 2004, under the Irish Presidency, that the Council adopted final conclusions on common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning processes, and the Council working party on youth issues is currently examining a draft resolution on that subject.</p>
<p>Turning to the subject of the acquisition of basic qualifications, it should be noted that the Commission recently – as part of the Lisbon Strategy’s ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme – made a recommendation on core competences, with specific reference to the IT field, and the Council and Parliament are currently examining it. The recommendation is principally intended to identify and define the core skills needed in a knowledge-based society in terms of that society’s cohesion and individuals’ self-development and employability; it is also about ensuring that, firstly, all young people, by the end of their basic education, possess the core skills needed in order to embark on adult life, and, secondly, that adults too can develop and update these skills throughout their lives.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Member States are currently being consulted on the possible creation of a European qualifications framework, the main purpose of which would be to ensure the inter-relation of national and sectoral qualification systems and thereby make it easier for individual citizens’ qualifications to be transferred and recognised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0037"></a>

<p>The United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have all opened up their labour markets to nationals of the countries of Eastern Europe. In welcoming workers from Lithuania, Poland and other new EU Member States, the former countries have managed to integrate workers from the latter countries in their labour markets and have increased their own GDP. However, the key problem of illegal labour involving the citizens of the new Member States arises in other EU Member States, in particular Germany and Austria, where restrictions on the migration of workers are being maintained. In view of this situation, does Austria still intend to maintain immigration restrictions for workers from the new EU Member States for three or five more years? What kind of example would the country currently holding the Presidency of the EU be setting for the other Member States which have not yet opened up access to their labour markets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)It should be borne in mind at the outset that an increase in the illegal employment of citizens from the new EU Member States is not a problem in Austria. As confirmed by the recent study by Biffl, Huber, and Walterskirchen: ‘Übergangsregelung zur Freizügigkeit’ [transitional arrangements for freedom of movement], Österreichisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, [Austrian Institute for Economic Research – WIFO], February 2006, illegal employment has not become noticeably more widespread in Austria.</p>
<p>Austria intends to maintain the transitional arrangements relating to the free movement of workers for another three years. Extension of the transitional measures is not about any one country setting an example, but rather – as is clear from the accession documents – it is for each country to take a well-considered decision on the basis of its specific situation and of the state of development of its labour market.</p>
<p>The individual and autonomous decisions by each Member State must take into account the states of their respective economies and their position in the growth cycle. One essential element in this is the potential for each labour market to absorb new workers, since responsibility towards migrants requires that they be able to meet the conditions for integration and be able to maintain themselves through their own labours. The geographical location also has to be taken into consideration, since the distance between the country of origin and the place of work will determine the extent of migration. Austria, which shares borders with the new Member States of the EU, is a good example of a country whose requirements for controlling the migration of workers differ in every respect from those of such distant countries as Ireland and the United Kingdom. It is in these outcomes and in the ways in which they develop that the Member States differ from one another, so that, for the purpose of the decision on the extension of the transitional arrangements, it is of only limited usefulness to cite any one country as an example for another to follow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0043"></a>

<p>The Austrian Presidency takes the view that the Member States should come to their decisions on the basis of the Commission’s report on the application of transitional measures relating to freedom of movement, and that such decisions should be balanced, taking into account all the various outcomes in each case and all significant factors connected with labour migration – primarily, that is, the state of the economy and of the labour market in the Member States in question, which will be crucial in determining whether it is certain, at least for an appropriate and predictable period of time, that the migratory workers’ income from work will be sufficient to cover their living expenses.

<p>2006 has been declared European Year for Workers' Mobility in order to make workers aware of the advantages of working in another country or in a new sector of employment. It is asserted that this policy, which means moving from one region to another within the same country or from one country to another within the European Union with the purpose of finding work, broadening work experience or improving the skills/knowledge of workers, will contribute to the implementation of the revised Lisbon strategy. However, unemployment is still high (over 8% in the EU of 15 and over 9% in the EU of 25 at the beginning of 2005). The slight reduction is due either to State subsidisation of jobs (France) or to a reduction in the workforce actually in employment (United Kingdom 1991-2003).</p>
<p>If there are not enough jobs in one country or region, what is the sense in workers from other Member States seeking work there? Is there not a risk that they will move in search of jobs which are precarious and of limited duration, with all the attendant consequences for social, personal and family life?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The Council agrees with the honourable Member that mobility for workers can involve them facing difficulties and having costs to bear.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Commission is endeavouring, through the EURES (European Employment Services) international cooperation network, to coordinate the European labour market as best it may. EURES has members and partners in the 25 EU Member States, as well as in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, and fosters the international mobility of workers by offering such services as information, advice and job placement to workers and employers wishing to avail themselves of the right to free movement. The portal is currently used by 500 000 enquirers a month and it carries at present 1.5 million job vacancies.</p>
<p>The network’s advice service also, however, provides jobseekers with information on living and working conditions (accommodation, education, the cost of living, health services, social security legislation, etc) in the individual Member States.</p>
<p>The year of mobility in 2006 aims to guarantee the free movement of persons as a fundamental right, and to promote both the professional and geographical mobility of workers and their efficient allocation in line with sectors’ need for labour and its productive and profitable use in the Member States. The labour market is subject to pronounced dynamics right across Europe, with jobs being extensively shifted around in the course of a year in consequence of the growth and shrinkage of industries in response to constantly changing demand, along with redundancies and recruitments. Furthermore, the European central statistical office works on the assumption that an assumed increase in new jobs of 1-2% per annum in some regions of the EU will result in a sectoral labour shortage in 2010 if there is too small an influx of labour.</p>
<p>It is, in any case, improbable that a worker seeking a quite specific job will want to move to a country or a region where such jobs are available only in small numbers. Although the total jobless figure in the European Union continues to be regrettably high, unemployment rates do vary very considerably from one sector or region to another.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1115"></a>

<p>(DE)The honourable Member asks for details of the Austrian Presidency's priorities in the sphere of employment and social policy. Austria will hold the Presidency for the first half of 2006 and during that period employment issues will be one of the focal points of the Council's work. Last year, the Council laid down the employment policy guidelines for the period from 2005 to 2008, guidelines which in principle remain valid in 2006. This year, the Council will concentrate on examining how those guidelines are implemented by the Member States. Measures in the employment sphere are of course chiefly taken using the so-called open method of coordination, i.e. without legislation being enacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the Austrian Presidency, the focus will not only be on employment issues, but also on issues relating to social inclusion and welfare protection, since the Council, drawing on work carried out by the Commission, will submit a report on these matters to the European Council at its Spring Summit in March. Further key priorities for the Austrian Presidency are: the amendment of the working time directive, continuation of the work on the coordination of laws in the sphere of social security, and consideration of the recent Commission proposal on the viability of old-age pension systems.</p>
<p>The honourable Member asks in particular whether the Presidency agrees that any new health and safety strategy should focus more closely on the implementation of existing legislation than on the enactment of new legislation. In that connection, the honourable Member is no doubt referring to the fact that, in its annual policy strategy for 2006, the Commission has announced that one of its key initiatives in 2006 will be a proposal for a new Community strategy on health and safety at work. However, that proposal will not be submitted until late 2006, when the Austrian Presidency is already over. For that reason, the Austrian Presidency will not be able to initiate discussion of that initiative itself in the Council. However, Austria intends to continue the preliminary discussions on the new Community strategy on health and safety begun under the UK Presidency. Accordingly, the Thematic Day of the Senior Labour Inspectors' Committee (SLIC), to be held in Vienna on 27 March 2006, will be devoted to a discussion of that issue.</p>
<p>I can assure the honourable Member that the Austrian Presidency will actively seek to achieve progress on the reform of the regulatory framework, as stated, for example, in the Joint Declaration on that subject. The Presidency will attach particular priority to implementing measures designed to bring about better lawmaking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0079"></a>

<p>(DE)Simply talking about "Better Regulation" is not enough: businesses and citizens demand visible results that have a direct effect on them. The important groundwork that makes these possible has already been done at Community level and in many of the Member States. They now have to become reality, and without delay. The following are particularly important:</p>
<p>Simplification of EU rules and regulations, which have tangible effects on businesses and members of the public. Taken together with the other ongoing efforts at (horizontal) simplification, Commissioner Verheugen’s screening initiative and the current plans for sectoral simplification get us on the right track.</p>
<p>The measurement and reduction of administrative burdens has direct effects on the persons involved. The instruments required are available to us at the European level, and now we have to make use of them.</p>
<p>The effects of EU law must be known in advance if it is to be possible to reach deliberate and well-informed decisions. Such decisions are facilitated by impact assessments, which must be produced to the highest possible quality and then made use of in the negotiating process. In this area, what is particularly crucial to the economy is the competitiveness test.</p>
<p>There is nevertheless the risk that the public and the business world will be but little aware of these activities and that these will have no real influence on their basically negative attitudes. One way of counteracting that would be to provide better information on the actual measures currently being taken to reform regulation – measures that affect the individuals concerned; a wide variety of measures are currently being taken in this area, and it is often difficult even for specialists in this field to get and keep an overview of what is going on.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, our activities must, as already mentioned, result in manifest benefits for all concerned, in the shape of cost reductions or work being made easier, for it only thus that we will reach our goal. I believe that the measures I have mentioned take us in the right direction in this respect.</p>
<p>Another important way of involving the public and businesses is certainly to consult them on regulations that will affect them. There are many initiatives to this end, but it must still be the case that the interested parties must be fully informed about the options available to them as regards consultation, with their opinions listened to at the policy-making stage, and they must also be given effective feedback about those opinions.</p>
<p>Both members of the public and businesses often tell us that important decisions and regulations tend more and more to emanate from ‘Brussels’, with the nation state’s role receding more and more into the background, so that they end up feeling powerless in relation to the EU.</p>
<p>It is surely too simple to blame ‘Brussels’ alone for this development. After all, the reason why we joined together in this Community was that we would all derive clearly measurable benefits from it. To take an example: after ten years of the single market, the EU’s GDP was 1.8%, or EUR 165 billion, greater than it had been before the advent of the single market, with 2.5 million jobs having been created and the standard of living rising by EUR 877 billion (equivalent to EUR 5 700 for each household).<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The question nevertheless arises as to whether maximising centralisation of regulation in Brussels is entirely beneficial. It is for that reason that the topic of ‘subsidiarity’ and the allocation of competences is also an important aspect of regulatory reform, raising the question as to which matters should be regulated at which level in the interests of maximum effectiveness. It is to consider this subject area that a conference on subsidiarity will be held on 18 and 19 April this year in St. Pölten.<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 24 March 2006, a conference of trade ministers will be held in Marrakesh. The annual European and Mediterranean conference on economic change will be held in Brussels on 19 and 20 June 2006, and, on 25 and 26 June 2006, the finance ministers will meet together in Tunis to discuss the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), to put in place arrangements for peer review and mutual support in the reform process and to raise specific matters of common interest.</p>
<p>As regards the economic side, the Presidency has set itself the task of transposing the relevant parts of the work programme, which means:</p>
<p>further liberalisation of the trade in agricultural produce, on which the Council has accepted a negotiating mandate;</p>
<p>further liberalisation of the provision of services. It is intended that negotiations should be officially opened at the meeting of Euro-Mediterranean trade ministers on 24 March 2006 in Marrakesh.</p>
<p>The Presidency will also, jointly with the Euro-Mediterranean partners, work towards the following:</p>
<p>Incorporation of the original Pan-European-Mediterranean Protocol into the remaining Euro-Mediterranean agreements;</p>
<p>convergence on standards, technical regulations and conformity assessments;</p>
<p>closer analysis of the effects of economic reforms and cooperation in the region;</p>

<p>(DE)The general direction taken by the Austrian Presidency with regard to the Lisbon Strategy</p>
<p>The Lisbon Process and its focus on growth and employment, which was decided in March 2005, are the basis for the direction taken by the Austrian Presidency in the fields to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>As Chancellor Schüssel said when presenting the Presidency's programme<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, during the first three months of its term of office - i.e. until the Spring Summit in March - the Austrian Presidency will concentrate on employment. Such subjects as job creation, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs, and education are of are the greatest interest to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p>The direction taken by the Austrian Presidency with regard to employment issues (including the adoption of new technologies and obstacles to the employment of certain groups)</p>
<p>The main theme of the Austrian Presidency in the field of employment policy is 'Flexicurity - flexibility through security'. This entails striking a balance between flexibility and social security in Europe. These two principles are not to be regarded as alternatives but rather as complementary elements: only on the basis of properly functioning social security and insurance systems can the flexibility be achieved on the labour market which is required in the interests of international competitiveness. At the same time, preserving competitiveness is the most important precondition for the sustainability of social security systems.<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>Only qualified workers can adopt new technologies. The Austrian Presidency therefore believes that the focus should be on knowledge, innovation and optimisation of human capital.<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>During its Presidency, Austria undertakes to continue the work which was begun during previous Presidencies. In the field of employment we continue to subscribe to the objective of getting more people into employment and keeping them there. The Council adopted this objective last year in the Employment Policy Guidelines for the three-year period 2005-2008<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Guideline 18, in particular, calls on all Member States to:</p>
<p>–	reduce youth unemployment,</p>
<p>–	take measures to increase female participation and reduce gender gaps in employment and pay,</p>
<p>–	work towards better reconciliation of work and private life,</p>
<p>–	support active ageing, including appropriate working conditions for older workers, and discourage early retirement.</p>
<p>On 25 January 2006, the Commission submitted the progress report on the Lisbon Strategy, which also incorporated a draft of the Joint Employment Report. This report shows that the individual Member States, like the European Union as a whole, have adopted the right approach: for example, all the national reform programmes emphasise efforts to get more people into employment and keep them there. Special efforts are being made to improve the employment situation of women, older workers, young people and the disabled.</p>
<p>The Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) and the Commission will finalise the Joint Employment Report. The Austrian Presidency will try to ensure that the key messages of the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) to the European Council in March 2006 also take up the principal theme of 'Flexicurity - flexibility through security' and - in the context of the demographic challenges which face us - devote special attention to improving the entry of young people into the labour market. On the basis of the report submitted to it, the European Council will draw its conclusion concerning the first year of the renewed Lisbon Strategy in the field of employment.</p>
<p>Combating social exclusion</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is undoubtedly aware, the Social Protection Committee is currently drafting the second joint report by the Commission and the Council on social protection and social inclusion, so that it can be adopted at the March meeting of the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) and submitted to the European Council at its Spring Summit. In this connection it will be for the Social Policy Committee and the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Protection) to make a political assessment of the national action plans to combat social exclusion.</p>
<p>This second joint report should assign due weight to the tasks which were defined at the informal summit at Hampton Court and which are derived from the review of the Lisbon Strategy in the spring of 2005. The report will therefore be based on the thesis that the interaction between the open method of coordination and the revised Lisbon Process should be reciprocal: social protection and social inclusion should promote the attainment of the growth and employment objectives, and the policy for growth and employment should yield social benefits. The joint report will be based on the plans and political declarations submitted by the Member States during 2005 concerning the three fields of policy 'social inclusion', 'pensions' and 'health and long-term care'.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency, for its part, will ensure that the most important results of the Joint Employment Report and of the Second Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion are duly taken into account in the key political recommendations on employment and social policy to be submitted to the European Council at its Spring Summit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)On 25 January 2006 the Commission presented the first annual progress report in accordance with the revamped Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment. The contents, particularly the draft report on employment, will be discussed in the Council (employment, social policy, health and consumer protection) on 10 March and subsequently at the European Council's spring meeting on 23 to 24 March.</p>
<p>The national reform programmes attach particular importance to combating youth unemployment and integrating young people in the labour market. Most Member States give special emphasis to this target group in their national reform programmes.</p>
<p>In the national reform programmes, Member States focus particularly on increasing employment opportunities by combining training and work and thus increasing the employment rate. Greater coordination between education, training, mobility, employment and integration policy will facilitate the transition from school to working life. Training systems are to be modernized and better adapted to the requirements of the economy, and entrepreneurship is to be promoted. Since youth unemployment is closely linked to failure at school, the proportion of young people who complete their secondary education or complete a university education (more rapidly) is to be increased. Subsequently efforts will be concentrated on pursuing an active labour market policy and improving the quality of vocational further training.</p>
<p>A number of Member States have specifically set national targets for 2010 for reducing the school dropout rate and increasing the proportion of young people who complete their secondary education. A large proportion of the additional targets in the employment sector are specifically concerned with reducing youth unemployment.</p>
<p>In areas in which some Member States have already implemented interesting and successful policies, it is intended to exploit the potential that exists there, to learn from one another and to adapt and/or adopt measures.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Strategy's 'European Pact for Youth' is intended to improve general education and vocational training, mobility and professional and social integration of young people and, at the same time, to make it easier to meet the conflicting requirements of professional and family life. This Pact is intended to ensure the proper coordination of all initiatives by involving youth organisations at all levels.</p>
<p>The Pact sets targets in the fields of employment, integration and upward social mobility; general education and vocational training, mobility and the compatibility of professional and family life (see annex). The reactions of most Member States in their national reform programmes are reassuring, according to the Commission.</p>
<p>An important new target in the progress report is to ensure that all young job seekers are given a job, or an apprenticeship, or a place in a training or similar employment measure.:</p>
<p>-	within six months/by 2007;</p>
<p>-	within 100 days of completing school or university/by 2010.</p>
<p>Enterprises are to be given financial and other incentives to offer for students and unemployed young people work experience.</p>
<p>From 28 to 31 May 2006 a 'Youth Event' is being organised in Vienna and Bad Ischl at the invitation of the BMSG as part of the Austrian Presidency of the EU. There will be a special workshop on 'Youth and Jobs'. The following employment policy issues, inter alia, will be discussed there: youth unemployment and measures to combat it, labour market policy vs. employment policy and work life balance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0091"></a>

<p>(DE)From the beginning to the end of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, the Council presided over in-depth discussions of the most important issues, which were the focus of the deliberations with a view to composing a draft ministerial statement.</p>
<p>The Council observed and evaluated the progress of the negotiations on the basis of reports from Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel. At various stages of the negotiations, the Council expressed its unreserved support for the Commission’s approach and actions.</p>
<p>At its last meeting, on 18 December 2005, the Council examined the final wording of the draft WTO Ministerial Statement that had emerged from the negotiating process. The Council informed Commissioners Mandelson and Fischer Boel that, in its estimation, despite certain defects and the lack of sufficient real progress on certain points, the outcome was generally acceptable. It accordingly approved the wording of the statement and noted the Commission’s intention to inform the final session of the conference that the European Community and its Member States approved the statement.</p>
<p>The Council underlined the EU’s determination to further pursue all its objectives in order that, in the next stages of the negotiations in the coming year, it might be possible to achieve far-reaching results that would be satisfactory to all parties.</p>
<p>The Council noted the Commission’s intention to state, at the meeting of the heads of delegations,</p>
<p>how important it would be for the EU to ensure, in the remaining stages of the negotiations, that non-agricultural products would be treated, for the purposes of market access, in the same way as agriculture;</p>
<p>that, in the Commission’s view, the text did not run counter to the EU’s desire that the abolition of agricultural subsidies should be given a monetary value;</p>
<p>how important it would be to the EU that an acceptable result be achieved on non-trade issues, including geographical indications.</p>
<p>The Council furthermore took note of the Commission’s statement to the effect that the progressive abolition of export subsidies should be fully consonant with the agreed reforms to the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p>The Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s debate of 16 January 2006 on the WTO Ministerial Conference and of the statements made by Commissioner Mandelson on that occasion. The Council looks forward with great interest to the evaluation of the results of Hong Kong that Parliament is to present before the end of April 2006.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 23 January 2006, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the agricultural aspects of the Hong Kong Conference, which were then examined in more general terms at the 30/31 January meeting of the General and Foreign Affairs Council, which had been preceded by an exchange of views between trade ministers on Sunday 29 January.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely monitor the further progress of the negotiations following the Hong Kong Ministerial Statement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0094"></a>

<p>What practical measures in the sphere of employment law is the Austrian Presidency supporting with a view to implementing the 'flexicurity' strategy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)The flexicurity approach is founded on the idea that the creation and maintenance of adequate social security apparatus is an indispensable requirement in terms of the development of flexibility and competitiveness, and the concern is not only with supporting the unemployed until they find another job. It is rather more about making available the facilities and programmes to ensure that, when people’s employment circumstances change, and in such ‘transitional stages’ as training and parental leave, they suffer no disadvantages and are offered pro-active support.</p>
<p>One example drawn from the European level is the Commission’s current proposal for portable supplementary pension entitlements, which operates on the ‘rucksack principle’. The object of this is to reduce obstacles to freedom of movement between and within the Member States in so far as they affect occupational pensions credits. When a worker moves from one job to another within one Member State, or where that new job involves him or her moving to another Member State, it is intended that he or she should, as a matter of principle, have the choice as to whether to leave their entitlements in the previous system – putting them on ice, so to speak – or to transfer the entitlements into the new one.</p>
<p>An example at Member State level is the introduction of modern, market-oriented forms of labour law in the formerly Communist new Member States. The establishment of unemployment support and of statutory pension schemes played an important part in creating the conditions for the market economy in that they enabled workers to move out of the big state concerns that had hitherto provided most social security benefits.</p>
<p>Another example is the Austrian creation, in 2002, of occupational severance pay and pensions funds (2002), which made employment much more flexible but no less secure. Before the reform, workers were responsible for their own severance payments, a requirement founded on the presupposition that employment would be for many years or indeed lifelong. This obligation was transferred to independent employee welfare funds, to which employers make monthly contributions. The consequence of this was that employees would be entitled to severance pay irrespective of any change of employer, while, at the same time, employers would be able to divide up their severance benefits regularly over a period of time and thereby have a better idea of their financial position.</p>
<p>The Employment Committee (EMCO), too, considered the topic of “Flexicurity – Flexibility through Security" when it met in Bad Ischl on 9 February. At this meeting, various case studies were presented from Austria, Poland and Norway, and it was agreed that the specific situation in each country was crucial in determining not only the practical aspects of the introduction of flexicurity-oriented measures but also the costs involved.</p>
<p>The committee also welcomed what the Commission had to say about flexicurity in its country-by-country progress report. As well as including flexicurity in the draft Key Issues Paper for the forthcoming Employment and Social Affairs Council, the Committee will be setting up a smaller group of experts under Danish chairmanship. This group will produce a working paper, on whose conclusions the Employment and Social Affairs Council in June will draw.</p>
<p>We expect the Green Paper on developments in labour law, which the Commission has announced and which is due to appear before the end of the Austrian Presidency, to trigger general discussion of current trends in the development of new work structures and the demands these will make of labour law at both the national and European level. It is intended that not only the European institutions and the Member States should engage in this discussion, but also and in particular the social partners at national and European level.</p>
<p>It follows that it is, at this stage, still premature to think in terms of specific legislative action, which can in any case be embarked on only as and when the Commission has presented the relevant proposals. The Commission will no doubt wish, in the first instance, to await the outcome of consultations on the subject of the forthcoming Green Paper before deciding whether actual legislation should form part of any future initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-1121"></a>

<p>The Treaty requires that the ultimate goal of all health-related activities should be the improvement of the health of the European public.

<p>Issues relating to women’s health, notably cardiovascular diseases and the increased incidence of lung cancer consequent upon a rise in the numbers of women who smoke will therefore be key points in the discussions at the informal meeting of EU health ministers in April, which will also give particular attention to such diseases as endometriosis and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency intends to present the Council’s June meeting with draft conclusions on women’s health, in which the Commission will be asked to produce a report on the situation as regards women’s health in the EU of 25 and to attach greater importance to the gender dimension in health policy.</p>

<p>The human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran dates back to 2002; the last meeting was held in the summer of 2004, since when, despite repeated attempts, the EU has not been able to arrange another meeting. The EU has called on Iran to demonstrate its respect for human rights and its commitment to dialogue with the EU. Despite the lack of any visible positive commitment on Iran’s part, the EU is still willing to engage in discussions with it on human rights, not least as part of the process of dialogue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)Following the introduction of the revived Lisbon strategy and of a new system of administration, in 2005, the Member States were urged to include in their national reform programmes (NRPs) quantitative targets for expenditure on research.</p>
<p>In the first NRP, which was submitted to the Commission at the end of 2005, 18 Member States set themselves quantifiable targets. None of these have achieved the expenditure target set for 2010, namely 3% of GDP, two-thirds of which, it should be noted, is meant to be funded by the private business sector, although it must be stressed that the targets set by the Member States correspond to an increase in (public and private) research expenditure to 2.6% of GDP by 2010 – a marked improvement over the present state of affairs, which the honourable Member rightly described as amounting to virtual stagnation (with current research spending amounting on average to 1.9% of GDP, 55% of it coming from business and industry). <a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Encouraging though the political will expressed in these quantified targets certainly is, the target aimed for is still rather less than the 3% set by the European Council at its meeting in Barcelona in 2002.</p>
<p>The Presidency will therefore constantly reiterate the importance of the shared Barcelona target, which will be crucial in enabling us to achieve the necessary edge over our competitors, although it is of course left to the individual Member States to take the necessary action to get more funding made available for research and development.</p>
<p>We are working continually towards this goal by means of the open coordination procedure, which is the only means available at Community level for encouraging the Member States to redouble their efforts in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Presidency has included among its priorities the continuation of talks to adopt common rules on the coexistence of GMOs with other forms of agricultural production. The Presidency is also aware of the demands of consumers, environmental organisations and producers, which have tended towards national preferences for organic and certified products. The present directive on GMOs and the Commission's approach to its administration is impeding the implementation of such policies, which has economic - and other - repercussions for the Member States, such as evidence of the effects of the coexistence of GMOs with conventional or organic crops and compensation for producers in the event of contamination. Furthermore, it has also been pointed out that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) bases its assessments solely on laboratory criteria, which are often far removed from reality.</p>
<p>Will the Presidency take the above considerations into account in order to improve the method of taking decisions at Community level and avoid implementing the current system across the board?</p>

<p>(DE)I am very glad that the honourable Member has put this question, which perfectly reflects the concerns of the Austrian Presidency. Parliament’s support will be of great value to the Presidency in its efforts to introduce a Community-wide policy on GMOs that will be guided by the public’s expectations and concerns while also taking full account of the need for health and the environment to be protected.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has emphasised, GMOs raise a whole range of issues around their long-term effects on health and the environment, and it is also to be borne in mind that (following a highly favourable assessment by the EFSA), the Commission is set to approve a number of GMOs despite the frequent votes by simple majority of the Member States in the Council against such approval.</p>
<p>The Environment Council will be having an in-depth discussion of this problem on 9 March 2006, in which issues of how to improve the assessment of GMOs’ safety, and also greater transparency in the approval procedure, will be considered.</p>
<p>The other important problem thrown up by GMOs is that of how they are to coexist with conventional and organic crops, that is to say, how to put in place more effective protection of conventional and organic crops against unintentional contamination by GMOs.</p>
<p>I can confirm to you that a conference prepared by the Commission will be held in the Austrian capital at the beginning of April and that what emerges from it will be taken as the basis for in-depth discussion at Council level in May, when the Council will – or so I hope – produce conclusions or recommendations concerning the introduction of common mandatory rules for coexistence with GMOs. This would be a way of avoiding the adverse effects of which the honourable Member was so rightly critical.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to point out that the Austrian Presidency is planning to hold a scientific conference on the precautionary principle in GMO policy, to be held in Vienna on 18 and 19 April.</p>
<p>I can therefore assure the honourable Member that the Presidency will do its utmost to address the issues relating to GMOs that she has raised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0096"></a>

<p>(EN)In 2003, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was the object of a major reform. The new single payment scheme has since been extended to include the majority of the CAP market sectors, with the notable exception of the wine, bananas and fruit and vegetables sectors, which are up for their own review in 2006/2007.</p>
<p>Though the reform included review clauses for the new instruments, and certain market sectors, in the period 2007-2010, the 2003 Reform was agreed in accordance with the conclusions of the Berlin, Göteborg and Brussels Summits, within an agriculture budgetary framework for the enlarged EU, set at the time until 2013.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is correct in stating that, in December 2005, the European Council reached a political agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspectives, which requests the Commission to make "a full wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the United Kingdom rebate, to report in 2008/2009”.</p>
<p>However, the 2007-2013 financial perspectives are currently the object of trialogue discussions between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p>Consequently, until the wording of the final decision is known, the Commission is not yet in a position to comment on what implications the agreement may have for the method and level of funding of the CAP.

<p>(EN)Reply to oral question</p>
<p><a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0033_EN.html">H-0033/06</a></p>
<p>by Ms McGuinness</p>
<p>February II 2006</p>
<p>The agreement reached by the Heads of Government in December 2005 offers clarity on the financial resources available for farmers and rural communities. It respects the agreement made in Brussels in 2002 concerning expenditure for direct payments and expenditure. However, all market and direct aid expenditure related to the enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania will have to be financed within the ceiling for EU-25. This increases the probability that financial discipline will have to be applied and lead to a limited reduction of direct incomes support payments for farmers in the old Member States.</p>
<p>As regards rural development, the amount agreed by the Heads of Government is less than the amount proposed by the Commission and also smaller than the amount available in the current period. This can of course affect our ability to meet the challenges facing rural areas, particularly in the context of ongoing Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the Lisbon agenda or Natura 2000.</p>
<p>However, what is important now is to start the programming of rural development for the new period. The Parliament opinion on the Rural Development Strategic Guidelines to be adopted during this session will therefore be a very important step forward.</p>
<p>Voluntary modulation, shifting funds from direct payments to rural development, was introduced for the first time in Agenda 2000, which allowed Member States to transfer up to 20% of their direct payments on a voluntary basis. Very few Member States made use of this possibility and it was replaced by an EU wide compulsory modulation system during the 2003 CAP reform based on a franchise of € 5000. It is the Commission’s view that this system is a fairer, more coherent and more effective way of achieving this shift.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view the proposed system of voluntary modulation, presents a number of technical difficulties. The application of modulation on market related expenditure seems technically impossible. The lack of a cofinancing obligation will reduce the overall financial effort devoted to rural areas, while the derogation from the rule that expenditure should be balanced between objectives may undermine the contribution to certain EU priorities. In all cases, the system should be established in a manner which does not cause delays in the agreement of programmes, particularly for those Member States which do not wish to make use of the system.</p>
<p>If the system were adopted in its current form, it would be appropriate to review its functioning within the general review of the Community Budget foreseen for 2008/2009. In particular because it would be very difficult to go ahead with further compulsory modulation, as previously suggested by the Commission, if voluntary modulation will be applied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0047"></a>

<p>(EN)Feta, a Greek Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for a cheese, was finally registered by the Commission in 2002. Several Member States applied for annulment of the registration under Article 230 of the Treaty. In its judgment on 25 October 2005 the Court of Justice upheld the name “Feta” as a protected designation of origin for Greece. This subject is now resolved and the result is legal certainty for producers and consumers concerning the protection of Feta as a PDO.</p>
<p>The Commission understands the honourable Member’s concerns about a lengthy legal procedure and the inconvenience and cost that can result. However, the right to bring a case before the Community Courts is enshrined in the Treaty. The Commission has no intention of compensating operators for costs resulting from this type of legal action.</p>

In this context, since there will be no quota restriction on sugar beet grown for bioethanol, the growing of non-food crops for biofuels represents a real possibility for sugar beet farmers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, before the end of 2006, the Commission will come forward with a report on the implementation of the energy crops scheme and if appropriate concrete measures to encourage the cultivation of energy crops. The Commission intends to amend the relevant regulation to allow sugar beet to qualify for set-aside payments, when cultivated as a non-food crop, and to make sugar beet eligible for the energy crop aid of €<span class="sup"> </span>45/ha provided under the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy reform.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0062"></a>

<p>Within this timetable the Commission will associate all the stakeholders of the sector with the impact assessment and analysis. One initiative will be to organise a stakeholders’ forum on 16 February 2006.</p>
<p>A Commission Communication to the Council and the Parliament will be presented by mid-2006. Following further consultation with stakeholders including the Parliament on the basis on the Communication, an appropriate legislative proposal would follow later in 2006.</p>

This regulation will specifically address the issues of illegal shipments and gaps in enforcement. It will enhance cooperation between Member States to facilitate the prevention and detection of illegal shipments as well as rules on inspections and spot checks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Since the end of the 1980s, Northern Ireland has benefited from EU financial support in favour of peace and reconciliation. This is a concrete expression of EU solidarity towards the peace process established by the 1998 Belfast Agreement.</p>
<p>In 1989, the European Community became one of the main sources of funding for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI), an international organisation established by a treaty between the United Kingdom and Irish Governments "to promote economic and social development, and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland". The European Community currently contributes € 15 million per year to the IFI.</p>
<p>In addition, in 1995, the European Community set up a special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation (the "PEACE Programme"), which operates in Northern Ireland and in the Border Region of Ireland. This programme aims "to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation in the region". From 2000 to date the PEACE II programme has continued work towards this objective and the European Council allocated a further € 200 million for the period 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p>The EU’s commitment to peace and reconciliation has therefore been amply demonstrated.</p>
<p>The appointment of a judge to examine past events in Northern Ireland is a decision on a sensitive matter to be taken by the Member States involved, with the benefit of their specialised knowledge of the region and of the historical background.

<p>(EN)This issue is of obvious concern to all of Europe’s citizens, particularly in light of the forthcoming World Cup tournament in Germany this year.</p>
<p>Begging is an obvious social problem, with undesirable consequences for both the people who practice it as well as the people who are subject to it.</p>
<p>In the process of building an area of Justice, Freedom and Security, the Commission is involved in increasing coordination, cooperation and information sharing amongst Member State police forces focusing especially on organised crime. Insomuch as organised, begging constitutes criminal activity, for instance when linked with trafficking in human beings and the corresponding measures can be used. On the other hand, due to the cross-border nature of problems related to major sporting competitions such as the World Cup, there are specific measures in place where Member States’ services are collaborating to minimise crime, public disorder and violence often associated with such events.</p>
<p>Under the Hague Programme of 2004<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission has been tasked with taking forward several initiatives which are likely to be relevant to this particular issue. The specific actions to develop in this context have been detailed in the joint Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme.<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> A key demand of the Hague Programme is that information exchange between Member State law enforcement authorities by subject to the Principle of Availability by 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2008. This means, in effect, that information should move between law enforcement agencies, without the fact that it crosses national borders presenting any sort of impediment. Work is already underway on this issue, with the Commission having recently put a proposal for a Framework Decision before the Council.</p>
<p>General police cooperation has likewise been made a priority. On 18<span class="sup">th</span> July 2005 the Commission adopted a proposal on improvement of law enforcement cooperation at the internal borders between Member States, and this has been followed up by monthly meetings of the police cooperation working group.<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Furthermore, the European Police College has now been given the status of a body of the Union following adoption of a Commission proposal on 20<span class="sup">th</span> September 2005,<a href="#defann_37_4" name="refann_37_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> which should be an important move forward in strengthening police cooperation and mutual understanding. Likewise, an exchange programme for police officers has been included as a priority in the AGIS<a href="#defann_37_5" name="refann_37_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> programme for 2006. All of these measures will enhance the ability of national police forces to tackle cross-border crime more effectively.</p>
<p>Insomuch as these gangs of beggars appear to be organised, the Commission is developing a specific strategy on organised crime at an EU level, and indeed a Communication on this subject was recently presented.<a href="#defann_37_6" name="refann_37_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Key objectives are to improve knowledge of the phenomenon and to strengthen prevention, investigation and cooperation on organised crime in the EU. The strategy is also to involve the intensification of cooperation with third countries and international organisations such as Interpol and Europol.</p>
<p>The honourable Member understandably voices particular concern in relation to the forthcoming World Cup being held in Germany later in the year. In addition to the initiatives outlined above, the Commission actively supports the development of improved crime prevention and control initiatives for international sporting events, and football events in particular. A key area of concentration has been on the exchange of experience between EU Member States in order to establish common standards of safety and public order. In particular, there is Council Resolution of 6<span class="sup">th</span> December 2001<a href="#defann_37_7" name="refann_37_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, concerning a handbook with recommendations for international police cooperation, and measures to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with football matches with an international dimension, in which at least one Member State is involved. In addition, a Council Working Group deals with aspects of violence occurring at sporting events and at football matches in particular.</p>
<p>The Commission has developed, and is indeed in the process of developing initiatives that should do much to enhance the ability of national police forces to tackle cross border activities with a criminal element.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)It is not possible at this stage to predict when accession negotiations with Turkey on the specific chapter concerning free movement of goods will begin. The screening of this chapter is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2006; subsequently, the Commission will report on the results of this exercise to Member States.</p>
<p>As for all chapters, the screening report will include a recommendation as to whether the chapter is ready to be opened for negotiation. If the Commission considers that negotiations should not begin on a given chapter, it may propose benchmarks to be met in order to allow the opening of that chapter. According to the procedures set out in the framework for accession negotiations, benchmarks will include inter alia, depending on the chapter, “the fulfilment of commitments under the Association Agreement, in particular those pertaining to the EC-Turkey customs union and those that mirror requirements under the acquis”. In this respect, the Council Decision on the Accession Partnership with Turkey, which is monitored in the bodies established by the Association Agreement, lays down, among the short term priorities, the need to “remove all restrictions to free circulation of goods due to discrimination against carriers of Member States, on the ground of their nationality or previous dockings”.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission refers the honourable Member to the declaration of the EU of 21 September 2005, which stresses that “the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey’s implementation of its contractual obligations to all Member States”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0002"></a>

<p>(EN)As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, the 2004 enlargement was an unprecedented challenge for the translation services of the EU, in particular that of the Commission.

<p>On 29 November 2005 the Commission announced a plan to reduce its numbers of translators. This plan particularly affects its Spanish-language translators, whose number would be cut by 33%. This is an especially severe cut in the case of Spanish, a language spoken by over 45 m EU citizens and more than 400 m people worldwide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Spanish is the language with the fifth highest number of speakers in the EU, the fourth most widely taught as a foreign language, and the fastest-growing EU language in terms of numbers of speakers both within and outside the Union. The cut in the number of translators would, paradoxically, place Spanish in sixth place in terms of translation.</p>
<p>Can the Commission provide the exact details of this plan to reduce the numbers of translators, of which so far we are aware only from media reports?

<p>(EN)The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission remains as committed as ever to the principle of multilingualism. According to Article 1 of Regulation No 1/1958 of the Council<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, all official EU languages are to be treated on an equal basis as far as the publication of legislation and other documents of general application is concerned.</p>
<p>This means that Spanish has the same status as any other official language. Moreover, no translator will lose his or her job. There will be no disadvantages for the translators concerned with respect to grade, salary, career development or any other similar aspects.</p>
<p>The principle of multilingualism is not linked to the number of speakers of a language, but is a democratic necessity: citizens of the EU must be able to read documents that directly apply to them in the official language of their country, whether they have 40 million or 400 000 native speakers. It is therefore logical that Spanish, Slovak, Dutch, Swedish and all the other official languages are treated equally, so that all EU citizens are granted the same democratic rights.</p>
<p>However, the Commission may, under Article 6 of Regulation No 1/1958 of the Council, decide which of the official and working languages are to be used for its internal communication. This should not be confused with the obligation to fully respect the principle of multilingualism in the translation of documents of a legislative or regulatory nature.</p>
<p>The human resources strategy of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation is an internal management tool which aims to make the most efficient use of existing resources. In general, the English, French and German language departments require more staff needed for the editing of originals, translating incoming documents from the Member States, etc.</p>
<p>Translating staff will be used appropriately to respond to new and growing demand, also in other linguistic areas such as web translation, editing, and in general reinforcing multilingualism in all aspects of the Commission’s activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2005, the Commission agreed on an ‘action plan to improve communicating Europe’. At the end of 2004, the Spanish Government submitted a proposal to the Council of the European Union seeking authorisation for Spain’s co-official languages (Catalan, Galician and Basque) to be used in certain circumstances, including in written correspondence between Spanish citizens and EU institutions. This would be financed by the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>While other institutions have already agreed to this, I am aware of the political difficulties surrounding the proposal that may arise at Parliament. However, as there are no problems with funding, I think that the Community’s political representatives should realise how important the request is. Not only is it a way of safeguarding a rich linguistic and cultural pluralism: it is also a way of bringing speakers of Catalan, Galician and Basque – without prejudice to Castilian – closer to EU institutions and policies.</p>

<p>(EN)The strategy of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation is an internal management tool which aims to make the most efficient use of existing resources, following the Demand Management Strategy put in place after the 2004 enlargement to cope with the severe lack of translation capacity in the new languages<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This strategy has lead to a reduction of the number of documents to be translated, which in turn has reduced the need for translators in the languages of the old Member States. In this context, it has proven necessary to allocate part of the existing translation capacity to tasks linked with multilingualism such as web translation, terminology, etc., which are in increasing demand as they constitute a means of communicating directly with the citizens.</p>
<p>This strategy involves all linguistic departments and does not by any means affect the status of any of the official EU languages.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the overall number of linguistic staff will not be reduced; no translator will lose his or her job. Translating staff will be used appropriately to respond to new and growing demand, also in other linguistic areas such as web translation, editing, and in general reinforcing multilingualism in all aspects of the Commission’s activities.</p>
<p>There will be no disadvantages for the translators concerned with respect to grade, salary, career development or any other similar aspects.</p>
<p>The principle of multilingualism is not linked to the number of speakers of a language in the world, but is a democratic necessity: citizens of the EU must be able to read documents that directly apply to them in the official language of their country, whether they have 40 million or 400 000 native speakers. It is therefore logical that for example Spanish, Slovak, Dutch, Swedish and all the other official languages are treated equally, so that all EU citizens are granted the same democratic rights.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that it remains as committed as ever to the principle of multilingualism and the application of Council Regulation 1/1958<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This designation is not acceptable: plastic surgery consists of far more than cosmetic surgery, no recognised qualification in cosmetic surgery exists in Europe, and this attitude will effectively legalise the practice of cosmetic surgery by unqualified persons calling themselves 'specialists in cosmetic surgery', thus endangering those who resort to their services believing them to be properly trained and qualified.</p>

<p>(EN)The Market Abuse Directive (Directive 2003/6/CE and its implementing measures: Directives 2003/124/EC, 2003/125/EC, 2004/72/EC and Regulation 2273/2003) has only recently been implemented in the Member States. It introduces more comprehensive and consistent rules of handling inside information throughout the financial markets in Europe. As a rule, issuers are now required to inform the public as soon as possible of inside information which directly concerns them. When they disclose inside information to any third party in the normal exercise of their duties, they must make effective public disclosure of the same information either simultaneously (in the case of intentional disclosure) or promptly (non-intentional disclosure). This obligatory disclosure does not apply if the third party owes a duty of confidentiality to the issuer.</p>
<p>The Market Abuse Directive has indeed made the issuers (and other persons concerned) more watchful of the proper handling of inside information disclosure. They now take greater responsibility for the access of third parties to inside information. The Commission thinks this is a good development. The Commission is also confident that existing and prospective shareholders will recognise the efforts of companies to comply with disclosure rules from the Market Abuse Directive while ensuring a steady and meaningful flow of information on their activities to the public.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that in this early period of application of the Market Abuse Directive issuers will receive guidance from the national securities regulators responsible for supervision and enforcement of market abuse rules. The Commission will of course closely monitor and evaluate the impact of the Market Abuse Directive and its implementing measures on the functioning of EU securities markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0019"></a>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member refers to a specific case of a company which has been the subject of an EU financial audit. This is difficult for the Commission to comment on, in the absence of more precise information. As a general rule however, it is a condition of Commission funding that projects financed from the EU budget may be subject to such an ex-post control, as foreseen in Article 60.4 of the Financial Regulations. The Commission reviews the Financial Regulation regularly, as foreseen within Article 184 thereof. The last review took place in 2005 and led to a proposal for the amendment of the Financial Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which is currently being negotiated with Council and Parliament and which the Commission proposes will come into force on 1 January 2007. As Article 184 provides for a revision of the Financial Regulation every three years or whenever it proves necessary, a further revision can be expected to start in 2007/2008, for entry into force in 2010.</p>
<p>When carrying out such audits, the Commission applies the relevant international standards. They include the possibility to comment on the auditor's findings and recommendations: a company or any other body that has been audited therefore has the possibility, during what is known as the "contradictory procedure", to bring further information to the Commission’s attention that may cause a revision with regard to the initial position. This should be done in writing (letter or e-mail), a means which is affordable for a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME).</p>
<p>On the more general point raised, the Commission means to assist SMEs and wishes to highlight the following:</p>
<p>-	The Commission adopted a Communication on Modern SME Policy for Growth and Jobs, aiming at creating a comprehensive policy framework for SME actions, in November 2005. It foresees actions to be taken to ensure that SMEs are taken into account when assessing or preparing EU legislation, and to simplify the rules and reduce the procedures for SMEs to participate in Community programmes. The Commission would welcome parliamentary support to further reduce the administrative burden for SMEs and strengthen their participation in Community programmes.</p>
<p>-	The Commission has upgraded the role of SME Envoy, which is now carried out by the Deputy Director General of DG ENTR<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The SME Envoy and her team are in charge of mainstreaming the SME dimension in EU policies, listening to SMEs and their representatives and highlighting their concerns to the different Commission services. The SME Envoy can be contacted directly at ENTR-SME-ENVOY@cec.eu.int</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>-	The Euro Info Centre (EIC) network provides detailed, appropriate and expert advice to SMEs on EU matters - including Community programmes. There are nearly 270 EICs and over 300 local EIC relay points across Europe. Indeed the Commission has developed two new mechanisms in order to improve the feedback from SMEs into community policy-making via the EIC network: “SME feedback” and the “SME panel”. “SME feedback” will identify difficulties encountered by SMEs in the implementation of European legislation or policies while the “SME panel” will test a piece of legislation or a policy in preparation among a panel of local SMEs. Therefore the nearest EIC may be able to look at the issue with the SME in question.</p>
<p>-	In addition specific tools and actions have been developed or are under consideration to improve information available to SMEs on ongoing and forthcoming programmes and to support their participation in EU programmes, including SME help-desks, local contact points or dedicated calls for proposals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)As laid down in Directive 95/46/EC, personal data concerning the health status of a person is considered to be “sensitive data” which requires special protection. Article 8 of the Directive subjects the processing of personal data relating to the health status of a person to special conditions. In substance their processing requires the consent of the data subject, or a national law allowing their processing and laying down appropriate safeguards, for instance in the framework of the provision of medical care of the management of health care services, or when it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject. The Directive allows Member States the processing of these sensitive data for other reasons of substantial public interest provided that they set up suitable safeguards.</p>

<p>(EN)The character of the EU, its institutional complexity and the absence of a unified and homogenous “European” public opinion are important challenges when defining Communication priorities.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that the European public has a relatively weak perception of the EU’s external assistance and its role in the world. While European public opinion surveys have revealed that Europeans are extremely positive towards the idea of providing development aid, only few associate the European Union with Development Policy. The Commission is very much aware of this and, together with Member States, other EU institutions and International organisations, is taking up this challenge. The communication action plan of Directorate General (DG) Development foresees a large variety of activities, both in all EU Member States and in our partner countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP), to promote European development policy. To reach best the various target groups, the Commission has put a special emphasis on information support to press and media. Special training seminars for journalists from the new Member States and from partner countries are organised in Brussels and weekly and monthly newsletters are sent electronically. The Commission has also developed various audiovisual products during 2005 to support the visibility of development policy and in particular Europe’s support to the MDGs (Millennium Development Goals). Some of these products were also part of an information campaign targeted at the public at large at the occasion of the United Nations World Summit in September 2005. The Commission has produced and marketed various TV spots, it has also produced and distributed various VideoNewsReleases as a service to the audiovisual media. Not to forget our publications. A special website on the main European initiatives in development policy during 2005 and, in particular on Europe’s support to the MDGs was put online in September 2005 and will be further developed this year. To connect with people in Europe, the Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid is also happy to the response to his web page and he has been happy to organise an Internet Chat with European citizens. The Commission will continue to strengthen its efforts in this area during 2006. It considers these communication activities important for the visibility of its foreign actions. It is important that with the different policy and communication initiative taken we communicate that European engagement is a value added for Africa and African development is a value added to Europe. The Commission shall do its part but success is dependent on other positive engagements. The EU as such provides more than half of the Worlds Official Development Aid. Clearly the EU deserves more visibility for its huge contribution to combat and eradicate poverty, also for the part that goes directly from Member States or via International organisations.</p>
<p>Heads of States and Governments declared at the end of the June 2005 European Council, a “period of reflection”, following the negative votes in France and the Netherlands on the European Constitution. Already in July 2005 the Commission agreed an action plan to improve communicating Europe. The action plan was followed by a Plan D agreed by the Commission, in October 2005. The Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate sets out a structured process to stimulate a public debate on the future of the European Union. As part of the ambition of informing people on EU’s role through concrete achievements and projects and listening to people’s expectations about what should be done in the future, there is a clear reference to Europe’s borders and its role in the world. The Group of RELEX (External Relations) Commissioners is taking this task seriously and is jointly approaching the challenge.</p>
<p>The challenges of today’s world are big, but the Commission has a good story to tell. Together with Member States, other EU institutions, other international organisations and the civil society, the Commission shall tell that story and shall hear what the citizens have to say.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid is personally engaged together with the Vice President for Institutional Relations and Communication Strategy and other colleagues to respond to this challenge.</p>
<p>Communicating the achievements of the EU development policy and the external assistance to the citizens was, is and it will be one of the Commission’s priorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0031"></a>

<p>The Commission has sent a reasoned opinion to Greece for failing to implement Community legislation, calling on that country to take arbitrary measures which will further exacerbate the problems of seafarers and workers in general living on the islands and, at the same time, will increase the risks posed to the safety of shipping and protection of the environment, thereby provoking an outcry.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that abolishing the objective criteria of tonnage and engine power to determine the composition of the crew, the age-limit for withdrawing superannuated vessels from service and the total liberalisation of economy-class tickets are in the interests of the users of these services, and of employment and development on the Greek islands or do they exclusively serve the interests and the profitability of the shipping companies and should the Commission, therefore, reconsider its position?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)In its reasoned opinion addressed to Greece on 19/12/2005, the Commission pointed out the need to comply with Regulation (EC) 3577/1992<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which applies the fundamental principle of the free provision of coastal shipping services.</p>
<p>Opening these services up to competition allows them to be provided at a lower cost for passengers and the community in general. In the event that private initiative is insufficient, public service obligations may be imposed. Although the EC Treaty takes account of the special nature of island regions, island coastal shipping services cannot, however, all be automatically classed as public services. Greece must justify the need for the public service obligations imposed for each of the lines in question.</p>
<p>In its reasoned opinion, the Commission has not expressed any grievance relating to the age-limit established by Greek legislation for the withdrawal of superannuated vessels.</p>
<p>The Commission’s reasoned opinion does not imply the total liberalisation of economy-class tickets. The Commission has only noted that almost all of the island lines are subject to price cap measures without any proof being reported, and even researched, to show that, on the lines in question as a whole, market forces alone will not be sufficient to ensure satisfactory price levels in terms of public service requirements. There are several lines with a significant amount of traffic throughout the year and on which there are several operators, for which such a framework has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>With regard to the determination of crews, the Commission has stated that for each category of seafarers, Greek legislation stipulates the number of them that must be employed on a vessel, solely on the basis of its tonnage, the number of passengers authorised to be carried and the time of year. By prohibiting operators from being able to take account of the type of vessel in question and of its specific needs, this legislation hinders the freedom of operators to chose the manner in which they provide their services to users, without the usefulness of the legislation in question in terms of safety and environmental protection concerns having been demonstrated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The course is not intended to test the participant’s linguistic abilities or to develop his/her language skills. The decision to offer this specific course in French and English only was determined by taking into account the languages in which, as a matter of fact, managers mostly operate in their day-to-day work (as opposed to those they can use) and by ensuring a balance between considerations of multilingualism and the sound and efficient management of the financial resources of the central training budget.</p>
<p>Language skills are developed in separate specific courses, covering 28 languages. All staff are able to develop their language competence in any of these languages, in line with both the multilingualism policy of the Commission and specific work-based needs.

<p>The statement by Mr Rehn of 25 January 2006 raises serious questions regarding the institutional and political role of the Commission as a guardian of the Treaties, the Community acquis and the European legal order. Does the Commissioner really believe that the attempt by the Turkish Government to conflate the issue of the obligations it has incurred, through its signature of the Customs Union and the decision of the Council of Ministers of 3.10.2005 initiating accession negotiations, and the strengthening of ties with, and the upgrading of, the Turkish Cypriot regime is worthy of serious consideration and constitutes an attempt to move forward on the Cyprus issue? Will the Commission say why, instead of insisting, as it should, on the timely ratification and smooth implementation of the Customs Union Protocol, it has rushed out a statement that it agrees essentially to changes in the agenda of the obligations of Turkey, a candidate country, thereby contributing to the 'deculpabilisation' of Turkey in respect of its contractual obligations? What purposes does this Commission move actually serve, since it allows Turkey to engage in haggling with the European Union, thus ultimately undermining and invalidating the decisions taken by the European Council and the Council of Ministers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Following the Parliament resolution on the difficulties faced by the European beekeeping sector in 2003, the Commission has taken into consideration economic losses caused by bee mortality in its support policy on beekeeping.</p>
<p>When Council Regulation concerning national beekeeping programmes has been modified in 2004, eligible actions within those programmes have been explicitly extended to the restocking of hives to consider bee mortality (which is a reality in some regions of the EU).</p>
<p>Under this new action, purchase of colonies and breeding queens can be financed by the Commission and Member States within the national beekeeping programmes in order to limit the economic impact of bee mortality on European beekeepers.</p>
<p>Among the € 23 million available in the EU budget for 2005 for beekeeping programmes, national beekeeping programmes sent by the Member States to the Commission showed that around € 1.5 million had been allocated to this specific action.</p>
<p>The placing on the market and authorisation of plant protection products is regulated by Council Directive 91/414/EEC. This Directive provides that pesticides may only be used if it has been demonstrated that their use bears no unacceptable effects on human and animal health, and the environment. This assessment covers the risks to honeybees and their larvae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by intergovernmental organisations such as the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, in which 47 governments collaborate. Its standards are periodically reviewed. The part on honeybees has been revised in 2002/2003 and the Commission is therefore not convinced of their obsolete nature.</p>
<p>Currently, the Community is running a wide programme of re-evaluation of old pesticides which started in 1993 and must be concluded in 2008.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is surprised that some of the substances continue to be on certain markets. However, it must be underlined that pending a Commission act national rules remain applicable.</p>
<p>This is also the case for the two insecticides that French beekeepers hold responsible for the increased mortality of their bees, namely fipronil (commercial name Regent®) and imidacloprid (commercial name Gaucho®) and to which the honourable Member is most probably referring.</p>
<p>These substances have been suspended by the French authorities since several years and their safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is ongoing.</p>
<p>The Commission is awaiting the results from this assessment. For fipronil, the conclusions of EFSA are expected by March 2006 and for imidacloprid after the summer. After submission of this scientific assessment, the Commission will have six months to take a decision on whether the use of these substances is acceptable.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission is treating the legislative elections in Angola as a particular priority, since they are a significant test of the government’s and the country’s commitment to moving towards democracy. The general situation in Angola four years after the end of the war, as described in the oral question, leads to enormous practical and logistical challenges in terms of organising the elections. President dos Santos has not yet officially announced the date of the elections, but the latest information suggests that it is less and less likely that they will be held in 2006.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures supported by the Commission in Angola, the ‘emergency mine action program for sustainable return and resettlement’, with a contribution of € 26 million, is directly aimed at the challenges identified and contributes to creating the conditions for holding elections.</p>
<p>A significant effort is also being made with a view to contributing to national reconciliation, both at central and at local level, with direct support for projects in the field of human rights and support for the democratic process, with organisations from Angolan local society, with appropriations from the Democracy and Human Rights budget line.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and as pointed out recently in the reply to written question 2512/05 by Mr Ribeiro-Castro, the Commission has informed the Angolan Government on several occasions of its willingness to contribute actively and more directly to the preparations for the elections, but the government has not yet responded officially to this offer of support. However, the Commission believes that the Angolan Government may take up the offer of support for the preparations for the elections, when the date of the elections is announced officially.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0057"></a>

<p>Since 1999, nine of the 25 Member States have been allowed to apply a lower rate of VAT to 'labour-intensive services': home renovations, domestic care, window cleaning, small repairs to bicycles and clothes and hairdressing. Lately, Austria had proposed that they should continue to be allowed to do so until 2010. Poland and the Czech Republic were granted a derogation period until the end of 2007, allowing them to charge a reduced level of VAT on new housing. However, the proposal to extend this period after 2007 was not approved. On Monday, 30 January 2006, Poland rejected a deal agreed by all 24 other members of the European Union. The Polish refusal means that other EU countries are breaking the law when continuing to levy a lower rate of VAT on the above services, and legal action can be taken against them.</p>

<p>On 19 January 2006, 'Coca Cola 3E' announced the closure of its factory in Athens and its warehouses on Rhodes, Corfu and at Messolonghi, with the loss of hundreds of jobs and immediate redundancy for 150 workers. In view of the fact that the company's profits rose during the first six months of 2005 alone to € 205 million, from € 156 million for the same period in 2004 - an increase of 17% - it appears that what the company calls 'restructuring' is no more than an expression of its intent to increase its enormous profits even further. This situation confirms that it is not only loss-making companies which carry out redundancies but even the most profitable and 'sound' because, in the name of 'competitiveness', they treat workers as expendable commodities.</p>

<p>In this regard, it should be pointed out that Community legislation contains various provisions aimed at ensuring the appropriate management and justification of restructurings, particularly in the event of the closure of a company. These include, in particular, Directive 98/59/EC relating to collective redundancies<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Directive 2001/23/EC on transfers of undertakings<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Directive 94/45/EC on the European works council<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, Directive 2002/74/EC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer<a href="#defann_65_4" name="refann_65_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees<a href="#defann_65_5" name="refann_65_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The Commission’s industrial policy, the employment strategy, actions in the field of equal opportunities as well as the use of Structural Funds, are of particular importance in the situation raised by the honourable Member.

<p>The Lisbon Agenda cites the information and communications sector as a key area for promoting growth in the EU. However, it is in the telecommunications sector in particular that Europe is in danger of lagging behind the United States.

Major European network operators, on the other hand, are still subject to double supervision by the competition authorities and regulatory authorities. The current legal framework was created more than 10 years ago as a purely transitional measure to bring monopolies within a competitive environment. It has since proved to be a curb on investment in new networks and markets.</p>
<p>Will the European Commission take the opportunity of the forthcoming review of the telecommunications framework legislation to opt out of sector-specific price and access regulation or, in the interests of investment certainty, at least set a clear deadline for ending such regulation?</p>

<p>(EN)It is somewhat misleading to suggest that the telecoms sector in the EU lags behind the United States (US); in broadband communications, for example, several Member States have higher penetrations than the US. Competition between US cable companies and incumbents is driving investment in fibre. Competition between infrastructures has allowed regulatory authorities in the US to relax the access rules on the fibre networks of incumbents. Nevertheless, US incumbents are still subject to supervision by state and national authorities<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Many European incumbents have decided to exploit fully their existing copper access networks rather than invest in fibre at present. To some extent this is due to significant differences in network architectures in the US and EU, and particularly to technical limitations in US networks, where the length of the local loop makes xDSL deployment impossible for up to 60% of US households.</p>
<p>Recent data from the European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA) indicates that investment in Europe has grown at a faster rate than in North America or the Asia Pacific since the introduction of the current regulatory Framework, which was in 2002<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and not ten years ago, albeit with significant differences between Member States. For example, telecoms investment in Germany was € 57 per capita compared with € 154 per capita for the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member urges the Commission to consider introducing an opt-out of sector-specific regulation or the inclusion of a sunset clause in the interests of investment certainty during its forthcoming review of the EU legislation. Withdrawal of price and access regulation is already foreseen in the current framework whenever markets are effectively competitive, as is the principle that emerging markets should not be regulated inappropriately. While investment certainty is important, experience with the growth of broadband in the EU since 1995 demonstrates that competition and not relief from regulation is the major factor driving investment. A study by SPC<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Network found in 2005 that broadband penetration in Europe increased by 3% for every 1% increase in competitiveness between different delivery routes (including cable, local loop unbundling/shared access and bitstream)<a href="#defann_66_5" name="refann_66_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also raises an important question of how can we best achieve competition and investment in next generation networks. In Europe today, the decision on finding the right balance between competition and investment can no longer be solely a national decision. This is a European process, and the review of the regulatory framework should not encourage fragmented national approaches which may favour only the former national incumbents and could thereby block the development of a true Europe-wide communications market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The issue of Chinese textiles, which occurred in 2005, has been solved through a “once for all” Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China (MoU) of 10 June 2005 as amended by the Agreed Minutes of 5 September 2005. It foresees quantitative limits. The sharp entry into force of the MoU led to transitional difficulties during the summer. In order to apply the quantitative limits as agreed in the MoU in a fair way, a fine-tuning of the MoU has been negotiated with the Chinese on 5 September 2005. On the EU side, the Council endorsed it on 7 September 2005. The Commission recalls that renegotiating this overall agreement is not an option.

<p>(EN)On 30 September 2005 the Commission adopted the Communication ‘i2010: Digital Libraries’ (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0465">COM(2005)465</a>), outlining a strategy based on three main pillars: (1) digitisation of content stored in traditional formats; (2) online accessibility of this content; and (3) digital preservation – making sure that our cultural heritage in digital format will also be available for future generations.</p>
<p>The digital libraries strategy is part of the wider efforts of the Commission to foster a better use of the Information and Communication technologies for economic growth, employment and quality of life, as defined in the i2010 initiative. The digital libraries initiative demonstrates the potential of these new technologies in projects for the benefit of citizens.</p>
<p>In the four months following this Communication, discussion and work on digital libraries has gained momentum, both at national and EU level. Progress is being made in various directions, indicating that the Commission’s strategy is well supported by the different actors concerned, including Member States, and cultural institutions such as libraries.</p>
<p>The Communication was discussed in the Culture Council of Ministers of 14 November 2005, where Member States showed strong support for the initiative and endorsed the idea of a European Digital Library based on the networking of national resources and building on existing initiatives.</p>
<p>The Conference of European National Libraries (CENL), an organisation comprised of 45 major European libraries, has committed to contributing to a European digital library based on an incremental and decentralised model, with a preferred multilingual central access point for users. The Commission is contributing to these collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>A High Level Expert Group (HLG) will advise the Commission on how to deal with the challenges for realising digital libraries. It will bring together stakeholders from the cultural institutions (libraries, archives, museums), publishers, rightholders organisations and IT-firms. The HLG will be composed soon; its first meeting is foreseen for the end of March 2006.</p>
<p>An online consultation on digital libraries was launched on 30 September 2005 and closed on 20 January 2006. It has triggered more than 200 contributions, which can be found at the following site: http://europa.eu.int/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/index_en.htm</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The input of stakeholders, which is currently being analysed, will be considered in drafting a Commission proposal for a Recommendation on digitisation and digital preservation, planned to be adopted by the Commission during the current year. The Commission has also started preparatory work for the announced Communication on digital libraries of scientific information. This is an area with its own specificities and dynamics in view of the need to handle and store huge quantities of digital data, and the rapid growth of publications only available in digital form.</p>
<p>Enhanced co-funding possibilities are being made available for initiatives on digital libraries with a real European scope and added-value. € 60 million are earmarked for projects related to digital libraries through the eContentplus programme (2005-2008). A first batch of projects received under the 2005 eContentplus call for proposals is currently being selected. Finally, the Commission intends to step up its research funding in this area under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programme for Research and Technological Development. The detailed work programme, including the proposals relevant for the digital libraries initiative, is at present being elaborated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0078"></a>

<p>(EN)An efficient investment fund business is crucial for mobilising savings for investment in the real economy and for helping households to accumulate savings for retirement. EU law in this area is restricted to allowing investment funds to be marketed in other Member States on the basis of their home country authorisation (the 'product/UCITS<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> passport'). While the UCITS passport has encountered some problems in its practical implementation, it has paved the way for cross-border sale of investment funds. However, it has not been enough to facilitate industry consolidation and greater efficiency. The European fund market is still populated by relatively small and inefficient funds.</p>
<p>The question whether the Commission should do more to enable the fund industry to better serve the European investor was at the heart of the July 2005 Green Paper. The Commission invited reactions on a range of new single market freedoms for the fund industry. These included the right of fund managers to manage a fund in another jurisdiction (management company passport); measures to allow more efficient pooling and merger of funds; and the possibility for funds to use custody and depositary services from partner country banks.</p>
<p>Responses received show a high level of interest in expanding the single market framework to include some of these possibilities. These issues are also to the forefront in preparatory discussions on the Parliament 'own initiative' report in response to the Commission Green Paper. However, feedback from industry, investors and national authorities pinpoints a number of commercial and supervisory issues that warrant further exploration. To help identify viable responses that meet these concerns in a cost-effective way, the Commission is taking a number of steps. It has asked an expert group to report on these issues in June: any recommendations will be tested with other stakeholders. The Commission has also launched two studies aiming to analyse the main challenges emerging in the asset management area.</p>
<p>All of this work will feed into reflections on any further steps that might be taken to enhance the single market for investment funds. The Commission will present its definitive conclusions on these issues in the form of a White Paper, which is expected to be adopted in autumn 2006. This could then be quickly followed by any relevant measures to enhance the functioning of the European single market for investment funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Directly after the flooding the Polish Government set about repairing the damage. We rebuilt more than 1 000 km of dikes and increased flood water retention capacity by more than 150 million cubic metres. In implementing the programme we are working closely with our German and Czech neighbours.

<p>(EN)On 24 November 2005 the Directorate-General for Regional Policy of the European Commission received a request from the Managing Authority of the Cohesion Fund in Poland for co-financing for the project “Raciborz Dolny Flood Reservoir on the River Odra”. After verification, this project application was considered admissible. A letter was sent to the Managing Authority in which the admissibility was confirmed and a project number was attributed to the project (2005 PL 16 C PE 020). The co-financing envisaged from the Cohesion Fund is € 130 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Commission services are studying the application and it is foreseen that, on the basis of the project description, questions will be submitted to the Polish authorities. If these questions are answered in a satisfactory way and if sufficient financial resources are available to make the approval of this project possible during the year 2006, a Commission Decision can be expected before the end of 2006.</p>
<p>However for the environment sector, financial resources for the period until the end of 2006 are already fully committed through 88 approved projects. Therefore the availability of financial resources depends on the submission by the Managing Authority, before the end of 2006, to the Commission of a sufficient number of applications to decommit savings generated in these 88 projects. Only on the basis of these savings could the Commission approve before the end of 2006 the above mentioned project as well as 11 other projects in the environment sector for which the Commission has received admissible applications from the Managing Authority, for a total value of € 335 million.</p>

<p>Energy policy should also be part of regional policy. This is made clear in the 'convergence' and 'competitiveness and employment' criteria of the European Fund for Regional Development which is now coming up for its second reading in the European Parliament. What is therefore involved is support for energy investments on environmental grounds, improving energy efficiency, the principle of promoting energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy and the development of effective energy management systems. At a recent conference arranged by the European Parliament with delegations from the national parliaments, it came to light that there is a lack of clarity as to the priorities that the Commission is setting in this area.</p>
<p>How does the Commission see this principle operating in practice and how, more specifically, can scientific research into and the regional development of renewable and sustainable energy production be integrated in practice into European Union policy and the policy of Member States and their regions?</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission recognises the importance of energy policy action in the framework of the forthcoming period 2007-2013 for European Union regional policy. In addition to the relevant provisions set out in the draft regulation for the European Regional Development Fund, to which the honourable Member is referring to in his question, the Commission had suggested specific priorities for future European Union energy policy action through Community regional development programs in its Communication ‘Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs: Community Strategic Guidelines, 2007-2013’<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, notably support projects on energy efficiency, promotion of low energy intensity development models and renewable and alternative technologies (wind, solar, biomass).</p>
<p>The role of the Community funding instruments are further specified in thematic Communications of the Commission, notably such on overriding political challenges for the energy policy of the European Union. Recent examples are the green paper on energy efficiency, the biomass action plan and the EU strategy for biofuels. For the forthcoming Spring European Council the Commission intends to table a green paper on a secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy for Europe, which will open the debate towards an integrated European energy policy. Then, the Commission intends developing a final Communication on energy policy later this year. Taken together, this should give further guidance for the Member States and their regions.</p>
<p>Concerning the integration of scientific research into the European Union policy, it should be highlighted that one of the objectives of the EU research policy is to contribute to the achievement of EU energy policy aims and targets as well as to help to successfully implement EU Directives at national, regional and local levels by supporting research and demonstration projects. Thus, they encompass both the development of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency addressing as well the mitigation of the environmental impact of energy production and use. Main priorities in the energy field proposed by the Commission for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Program (2007-2013) are: electricity, fuels and heat production from renewable sources, energy efficiency and savings, hydrogen and fuel cells, clean coal technologies, zero emission power generation and smart energy networks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The organisation of the national merger control system is a competence of the Member States. In this respect, it is also for the Member States to determine the degree of independence of the National Competition Authorities. Having said that, over the last 10 years, a clear evolution towards greater independence can be observed in the status of National Competition Authorities. This is something which the Commission welcomes.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also mentions the impact of mergers in strategic sectors for the internal market and the growth of the European economy, and cites as a particular example the energy sector. The honourable Member will be aware that the Commission has recently expressed some concerns about the allocation of cases between the Commission and National Competition Authorities in this context. In particular, experiences with mergers in the energy sector in recent years have shown that similar cases are sometimes dealt by the Commission and others by National Competition Authorities. It is therefore important to ensure that similar cases, in terms of their impact on the functioning of the common market, are dealt with in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the Commission has started a re-examination of the 2/3rds rule which has a direct impact on the division of competences between the Commission and Member States. According to this rule, concentrations in which each of the undertakings concerned achieve more than two-thirds of their Community-wide turnover within the same Member State do not fall into the Commission’s competence. The Commission has started to collect relevant data concerning those mergers which would have been looked at in Brussels, in the absence of the rule. It will then be possible to assess how the two-thirds rule has functioned in practice both (a) in terms of the number of cases affected, and (b) in terms of the nature of those cases. Once this fact finding exercise is concluded it will be examined whether there are improvements to the present system that the Commission could propose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
