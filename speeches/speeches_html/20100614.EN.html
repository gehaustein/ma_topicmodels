<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – I would like to inform you that during this part-session additional camera operators with special equipment will be present in the Chamber. Just as during the Brussels part-session, they are going to film our debates and votes to produce a widescreen film about Parliament’s work for the new visitor centre in Brussels. There is going to be an exhibition on this subject in Brussels. I have obtained an emphatic assurance that the technicians will be very discreet and will not interfere in any way with the progress of the sitting. Thank you for your understanding. We would like as many Europeans as possible to be familiar with the way Parliament works.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventy years ago, on 17 June 1940, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were attacked by the Red Army and illegally annexed to the Soviet Union. This was a direct consequence of a pact made between Hitler and Stalin in September 1939, which also gave the USSR control of Finland and part of the territory of Poland and Romania. The European Parliament – our Parliament – was the first international organisation to condemn the fact that the Baltic countries had been occupied. This was in a resolution made 27 years ago in January 1983, which also recalled that the occupation had not been recognised by most of the countries of Europe or the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember, too, the first anniversary of the elections in Iran, particularly in view of the intense repression which is being widely used there. Last year, the authorities carried out 488 executions and imprisoned thousands of people. Many political prisoners are awaiting execution because they are said to have played a role in last year’s demonstrations. The European Parliament expresses its greatest alarm at the situation, especially in view of the lack of free speech and the right of assembly. The European Union, and Parliament in particular, is permanently opposed to capital punishment, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in Milan, the funeral was held of the President of the Turkish Episcopal Conference, Bishop Luigi Padovese, who was murdered in Turkey. Unfortunately, this was another murder of a Christian clergyman in the region of the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Last weekend in Lisbon and Madrid, I represented the European Parliament during celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the accession of Portugal and Spain to the European Union. Both these countries have achieved great success in the Union, and we must not forget this, despite the fact that, today, they both stand before difficult economic reforms. We talked about this during the celebrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I was also in Luxembourg, where we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Schengen Accords. It can be said that this is one of the most citizen-friendly accords. Our citizens understand this very well. The Schengen Accords provided a great stimulus towards building a European Union of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last two weeks, I have made official visits to Greece and Romania. I expressed support for the people of these countries, and assured them that they can count on European solidarity. We also spoke about the fact that solidarity should always be accompanied by responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last item of information. Recently, free parliamentary elections have been held in three countries of the European Union: Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia. To our fellow Members from these three countries we wish the rapid formation of governments, and we also hope for fruitful cooperation with the newly returned Members of the national parliaments with us – with the European Parliament. This is very important for the achievement of our common ideal – the ideal of a united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title3"></a><a name="creitem3"></a>

<p class="contents">Before I come to the presentation of the mandate which has been adopted by the Committee on Budgets, and which I hope will be adopted at our vote in plenary tomorrow, I would like to say a few words about the budgetary year 2011 in view of its special character. It will be a ground-breaking year, because the European Union budget for 2011 will, for the first time, be adopted under the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon enhances the powers of the European Parliament and extends our ability to make codecisions about the European Union budget, including in areas about which previously we could not fully participate in the codecision procedure, such as agriculture, for example. This is a huge qualitative change. The Treaty of Lisbon also introduces far-reaching procedural changes, and in particular it lifts the requirement for first and second readings. The European Parliament is going to have one single reading of the budget, and in the same way the Council will only read the budget once. What does this mean in practice? It means the conciliation meeting will probably take place in November, but above all it means the new budget procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon will require greater discipline and self-control from all interested parties. We are not going to have a second chance, and we are not going to be able to come back to negotiations. We, the European Parliament, must think carefully beforehand about what we really want to achieve, because we cannot do as we have done in previous years, when we built up our expectations and reduced them at second reading. Now we have to think carefully at first reading about what we really want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the opinions of other committees for their contribution. The Committee on Budgets received several very interesting and important opinions from different committees which will certainly be taken into account at subsequent stages of the budgetary procedure. These words of appreciation are first and foremost of a personal nature. I must thank the authors and acknowledge that I have learned a great deal about the priorities of their committees, and that knowledge, I hope, will be of great help to me as your rapporteur in the autumn during negotiations with the Commission and the Council. In addition, many of the detailed expectations of particular committees could not be included in my report, which has been issued by the Committee on Budgets, because the mandate for trilogue in June cannot be extended. We must concentrate on several of the most important matters, and we can elaborate on the details in September during the process of tabling individual amendments. We cannot get down to such a level of detail during the first negotiations. Therefore, I would ask for your understanding concerning the fact that I was against many of the detailed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, now, to say a few words about key priorities for our negotiations at the end of June, and about the most important matters which I would like you to support at tomorrow’s vote as matters to be submitted by the European Parliament. Above all, during our first talks with the Commission and the Council I would like to draw attention to the most important thing – the fact that the current Multiannual Financial Framework is coming to an end. What was agreed in 2006 is now slowly becoming insufficient for the new priorities. We have two parallel processes which are at the same time slightly opposed to each other. On the one hand we have the growing ambitions of the European Union in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon and our expectations of the European Union, for example the creation of EU diplomacy and support for ambitious research projects, and on the other hand we have the progress of the economic and financial crisis in particular Member States, which is forcing savings to be made. These two opposing processes are also being affected by the restrictions of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Margins are being reduced, and the European Parliament has less and less leeway to finance its priorities. It is essential that we talk about this with the Commission and the Council in June. If we have great ambitions – and not only Parliament, but also if the Council has great ambitions – we have to talk, too, about how to finance these plans. Otherwise, they will just stay on paper and be empty words.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like the year 2011 to emphasise the significance of programmes for youth, programmes which are tried and tested, reach a wide range of young people and are efficient and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The next matter: the European External Action Service has already been referred to, and we have to talk about it. We also have to talk about the budgetary consequences of the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has already been agreed and accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly encourage you to endorse the report of the Committee on Budgets. It is summarised in paragraph 91. I would like to thank everyone again for all their contributions. Many of these matters will come back in September as amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Connie Hedegaard, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>− Mr President, let me first, on behalf of Mr Lewandowski, ask you to please accept his apologies for not being present. He is unfortunately constrained by the annual meeting of the Commission with the Court of Auditors where he takes an active part in presenting the recently adopted triennial revision of the financial regulation; so he simply had to be there today.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore replace him and I will of course transmit to him the comments which you express in this first debate on the Commission’s presented draft budget and the forthcoming trilogue which precedes Council’s reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Our dialogue this year will go well beyond the 2011 budget, as important political initiatives with far-reaching budgetary consequences are being discussed. But let us not forget that one of the major components for this year is the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty in budgetary matters. We need to keep our commitment to ensure good collaboration between the institutions – as good as it has been in the past – within this new institutional framework. This is vital to achieving a successful and timely outcome to the 2011 budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me then stress that I do take thorough note of your concerns and can assure you that the Commission shares the view that there is a need for a targeted quota of spending which is becoming even more important in a restrained context. The Commission has presented a draft budget which respects the financial framework and is based on sound estimates. It is important to recall that the draft budget for 2011 has been drawn up in a context of tight expenditure ceilings and national finances under severe pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Against such a difficult background, the Commission has proposed a draft budget which responds to the political requirements with a justified and reasoned increase. Yes, in the current difficult economic situation the recovery effort will have to be pursued, and the rapporteur is right also in placing this, as we have just heard and as I can see from the document, at the heart of social inclusion strategies. Its innovative abilities are a key resource for the development and growth of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a call on this House to support our proposal and particularly the increase in payment appropriations, since it constitutes a tangible contribution to delivering implementation on the ground and to supporting European economies. As spending programmes reach cruising speed, increased payment levels for activities under the heading Competitiveness for Growth and Employment, that is +6.8%, and Cohesion for Growth and Employment, which is +16.9%, prove that these policies are implemented vigorously to accelerate the recovery process. Good budgetary implementation remains also essential and in particular the implementation of the structural and cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that the Commission remains committed to maintaining administrative efficiency and, in line with previous commitments, the Commission will not request any new posts. It wants to underline that such commitment goes beyond the establishment plan and also applies to external personnel, for which the Commission is even proposing a reduction. Every year the Commission provides full information on administrative expenditure; it is ready to discuss with the budgetary authority any alternative presentation to ensure transparency on this expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by thanking the rapporteur for making available at such an early stage an indicative list of new pilot projects and preparatory actions ahead of Parliament’s reading. This will help our dialogue and ultimately allow for the best implementation of projects which will be adopted at the final stage. I am confident that at the forthcoming trilogue we will have the opportunity to advance in a constructive way, as in previous years. The Commission will continue to do its utmost to help to pave the way for a successful outcome to this budget procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union’s competences have been significantly expanded with the Treaty of Lisbon, and we should finance policies in the areas of industry and research and development such as space policy and innovation policy, and strengthen existing policies such as those in the areas of research and development, energy and industrial development. My fellow members will no doubt recognise that these are the areas in which the most jobs can be created within the European Union, and therefore support for these policies is of strategic importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Our most important objective for 2011 is to ensure that the 7th Framework Programme will not be burdened by such policies, but that we find other sources of funding for these policies, since the extension of the Seventh Framework Programme in itself carries great risks. In addition, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy all take the view that budgetary flexibility is necessary, so that, for instance, the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) can be realised more effectively than it is at present. It should come as no surprise that I wish to close with the observation that one result of the past five years has been the priority given to small and medium-sized enterprises, and therefore the promises we have made to small and medium-sized enterprises cannot remain unfulfilled. For the moment, we regret that these are lacking from the plan submitted by the Commissioner, and we hope that the Council and Commission will come forward with innovative ideas that we will be able to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was delayed coming to Strasbourg, as many can be, but I did see much of the countryside on the way. As you know, there is much pressure on farmers and the rural community.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the budget rapporteur for her work and for her commitment to keeping her colleagues informed at every stage of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some concerns around agriculture. I hope that the Commission’s optimism over market developments comes to fruition and is accurate, because if it is not I would be worried about the budgetary pressures in 2011 should the markets not evolve in the favourable way that the Commission anticipates. There have been problems in the past and we fear that these might happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to mention in this budget debate the difficult situation around agriculture payments as we look beyond 2011. It is good that there will be no financial discipline required next year, and indeed I hope that position prevails, although it will be tight in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this House needs to know that in 2013 we will be facing a situation where there will be reductions in payments to farmers where modulation applies, and that is before we have reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A simple message to the Commission is that agriculture is vulnerable and it is important for food security, for environmental protection and because it is the very heart of the European Union. It needs an adequate budget and that must be reflected in the resources that are made available to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Market support measures are vital when we have a crisis, and that is why I stress my concerns that you need to be cautious about how the markets emerge in terms of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking today at the countryside looking at its best, I would say there is a price to be paid for a countryside and a rural fabric that will survive and thrive, and this needs to be reflected in the budgetary resources we make available to agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 16 years in Parliament I do not remember when there was so much pressure from the national treasuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is clearly going to be seeking a reduction in payment appropriations, even to below 1%, in particular based on the under-implementation – which is now beginning to emerge – of the Structural Funds, due to cash-flow problems in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will also want to establish reductions in commitment appropriations in the category of administrative expenditure in order to bring this category 5 in line with the general trend of cuts emerging in the national administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Council will want to create large margins in the expenditure categories in order to safeguard some of the priorities that the rapporteur mentioned, such as Kozloduy, the international thermonuclear experimental reactor and Galileo, which, although they are very important, were not provided for in the current financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The circumstances are obviously extraordinary, and were not foreseen when we adopted the multiannual financial framework in December 2006. If there is any flexibility in the EU budget mechanism, this is clearly the time to demonstrate it, but it will require a great deal of flexibility in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The crises in the national treasuries are a fact, but the European Union’s political priorities, expressed for example in this budgetary mandate, are also a fact.</p>
<p class="contents">We will of course all act responsibly during this financial year; of course we will find areas of the budget where savings can be made, but let us not forget that a European Union strategy for economic growth requires an adequate EU budget. Parliament will fight to secure that budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This budget is going ahead, developing and taking shape at a difficult time. The margins available for commitment appropriations amount to EUR 1 200 000 000 – and so are very narrow – but the matter is made even more sensitive by the fact that 70% of the appropriations come under Heading 2, the heading that covers policies for agriculture, conservation and natural resource management, and hence the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget is also difficult because of the many open procedures that will largely determine the quantities of resources that will actually be available. Such procedures include the budget review, financial regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement, implementation of the External Action Service, but above all the meltdown and the instability of financial markets. The very meltdown that endangered the euro also demonstrated that the budget and resources are crucial to any European response, thus illustrating their importance, but also their limitations.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the European Parliament must draw a line, and establish which of the priorities should have the highest profile in its main accounting document. As a group, we have chosen to tread a fine line between the need to uphold the purpose of this mandate, and the need not to debase its political meaning. Our central priority is therefore not to repeat our past mistakes, and this means we must guarantee appropriate resources for achieving the objectives of the 2020 strategy, but also keep enough resources for actions under Heading 2, particularly actions that help tackle unemployment. It is also important, however, to ensure that the fight against climate change remains central.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore many challenges to be faced. We also recognised one challenge as central at the beginning of the mandate: the need to make a real effort to coordinate and restore consistency between our European budget and the budgets of individual Member States, because the consistency and coordination of the economic policies of the Union and its States are fundamental values for the future of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much and my humble apologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The current economic crisis has hit the developing countries hard – and harder than the countries in the developed world – even though they are not responsible for the causes of this crisis. The same applies to climate change: developing countries have little to do with the causes of climate change, but they are suffering the most from its effects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of great importance that the EU makes sure that money meant for development goals actually serves this purpose and this purpose alone. First of all, it means that the budget aimed at supporting developing countries in their fight against the effects of climate change should be additional money. The ‘fast-start’ climate finance package should not come at the expense of existing development cooperation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I support the principle of financial assistance to the main ACP banana-producing countries. However, this should not be financed via the margins, and I strongly oppose the draft proposal by the Commission in which funds from the development cooperation instruments are redeployed for this assistance. Funds used under the DCI must target poverty alleviation, and although I support the creation of an instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries – ICI+ – that instrument should not be financed by the DCI either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is right in saying that the multiannual financial framework for the EU’s budget is now so tight that a lot of promises will be very difficult to fulfil. We can say that in previous years we have been able to find unused funds from the agriculture budget, but there is not that much in unused funds any more. We need to be able to follow up on the 2020 growth strategy and to invest in joint energy projects and in joint transport projects, we need to be able to invest in young people and in research and we need to be able to finance a strong and joint External Action Service. I am also very much in agreement with Commissioner Hedegaard that we need to ensure that there is sufficient payment into the Structural Funds to enable us to fulfil our promises to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We desperately need the promised mid-term review of the budget so that we can be clear about how we can finance new needs. Strangely enough, we are now seeing more and more examples of Member States wanting to pay. They just do not want to pay via the EU budget. We see this, for example, in the establishment of the three new financial supervision agencies that are intended to protect us from future financial crises in the EU. They are to be paid for both by the Member States directly and out of the EU budget. If the whole of the expenditure were to be taken from the EU budget, the multiannual financial framework would burst! However, it is, of course, a lot more bureaucratic and cumbersome to collect money directly from the Member States and it gives us a poorer overview, less control and a poorer ability to monitor the situation. This is a very negative development.</p>
<p class="contents">So, should we not make savings in the EU budget? Yes, of course we also need to be thrifty during times of crisis, but I simply want to say that if all Member States had pursued their budget policies like the EU budget there would not have been any deficits and there would not have been any problems with debt, because the EU budget has ceilings and a rigid framework. There is no possibility of creating problems. Thus, perhaps the national authorities should learn from the EU and consider whether this is something they could use at national level too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The global perspective she adopts, which avoids getting lost in too much detail, is entirely suitable. When negotiating a mandate, it would be inappropriate to get lost in too many details. My group will therefore support this mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the substance, I note that the report refers repeatedly to the need for Europe to take action to combat the economic and financial crisis, and of course I welcome that. However, it is regrettable that there is no mention of the environmental crisis that may yet have far more important long-term implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Responding to the environmental crisis and climate change should provide a much greater incentive to Europe to take action. Obviously, such a response should be reflected in the EU budget and, while I welcome the increased budget for LIFE+, this is obviously not enough and will not do.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a new European green deal: one with a green approach to agricultural policy, with less emphasis on arable land and more on the quality of our food and the sustainability of farms; a research policy that does not cause taxpayers’ money to disappear into a bottomless pit, as the ITER project has done, but which focuses on renewable energy, sustainable transport, and innovation in green technologies; the Structural Funds, which should be allocated according to criteria for the fight against climate change – and the concentration in road infrastructure is not really an innovative policy in that area; and finally, a fisheries policy that does not exacerbate the problem of overfishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am not going to get lost in examples of what I would like. I will, however, support the report because I believe it is a good mandate for the trilogue; as for the rest, we will return to the draft budget later, but I do think that the resources are insufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European United Left is openly opposed to the frightful and frightening rehabilitation of a new wave of stability programmes to reduce government deficits, which will end up plunging Europe into a new recession. The draft European budget, which is the basis for the mandate we are now debating, is constrained not only by the Treaties in force or a multiannual financial framework that should have been reviewed a long time ago: it is also fettered by this model that I have just criticised in very brief terms.</p>

Quite the opposite, in fact. Complaints are still being made that the increase in the budget is too small. The report thus seeks to preserve the status quo and does not make real progress in any particular direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very easy – particularly in the area of administration – to make large savings on supposedly trivial things. I am thinking, for example, of the area of EU agencies. By closing down or merging EU agencies, we could save half a billion euro in a year without actually reducing the quality of the administration, or perhaps we could also wind up the Committee of the Regions or the European Economic and Social Committee. We could surely easily save EUR 200 million in a year by doing that, and if we sell the buildings we can save as much again. Perhaps we should look at ourselves. We could also start to make savings in the European Parliament. For example, we could all stop travelling business class within Europe. That could also enable us to make a very reasonable contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">What I like about this report – and I wanted to mention this – is the priority given to lifelong learning. In this regard, we should, in particular, be setting the priorities for the Leonardo da Vinci programme. Trainee exchange is very important. Perhaps we should also create a financial instrument that would enable at least part of the costs to be paid for all of those citizens who want to make use of this citizens’ initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can we adopt a 2011 budget without knowing how we will assume the new responsibilities conferred on the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon? Since February, the Committee on Budgets has been asking the Commission to present the draft revision of the financial perspective that we need. Having received no reply, the day after tomorrow we will debate the oral question that we submitted on this subject. That is the first cloud of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second cloud is the new financial crisis, the crisis of public debt. On 9 May 2010, the European Council decided on a financial stabilisation plan to the tune of EUR 750 billion. This plan includes EUR 60 billion that the EU can borrow and lend with the guarantee given by the EU budget. This is a radical new opportunity that accounts for half of the EU budget, but Parliament has not been consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Thursday will probably bring a new cloud to the horizon: the 2020 agenda, which the European Council should adopt. It includes half a dozen flagship priority actions. With no source of funding, this strategy has no credibility. Yet it is presented as the European Union’s road map for the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sea of uncertainty, the Committee on Budgets, rallying behind its rapporteur, is urging the Council to take some political decisions. Should we spend more or should we spend less? Moreover, if we want to spend better, the time is ripe to do something that has never been done before: share responsibilities between the EU budget and national budgets and, in order to do so, make the national parliaments part of the Union’s new mode of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">All our Member States are ruined, and the Union itself is funded by them. The time has come to show imagination and daring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has established excellent cooperation both with the political groups and, in particular, with the sectoral committees. I think that is extremely important in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have broad consensus on what we need to do when the Member States are in such an incredibly difficult economic situation. What is particularly necessary, of course, is to reach agreement in those cases where we will be fighting for a revision of the budget ceiling in order to get more money. We need to do that in a few areas, despite this difficult situation. I am thinking of two areas in particular. In category 1, in other words the policy for growth and jobs, it will be absolutely necessary if we are to be able to affirm Parliament’s role with regard to economic recovery, and also in category 4, the EU’s role in the world, although we really need to concentrate on the absolutely key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on a few points our opinion seems to differ from that of the rapporteur, and we will be tabling amendments in a couple of important areas. I will just mention three of these quite briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns youth policy. We are in agreement about the order of priority, but we feel that the rapporteur’s focus on mobility is much too one-sided. The situation of young people, particularly youth unemployment, involves much more than this. It is about education, it is about labour market policy and it is about social measures.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the question of Gaza. It should be an obvious course of action, even for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to support the demand for Israel to lift its blockade, just as the Council did earlier today. Some are saying that this does not belong in a budget item. I think that is wrong. This has everything to do with the budget, because the blockade is hampering the EU’s efforts with regard to reconstruction and we are not getting the necessary materials through, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to mention concerns aid. With regard to the climate, the so-called ‘banana company measures’ and cooperation with industrialised countries we need to be clear about the fact that this must not encroach on aid to the poorest countries or on the Millennium Development Goals. I therefore appeal to the rapporteur and the political groups to support these highly reasonable amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to EU 2020, research and development is one of the flagships, and it is already planned in this budget that there should be 15.8% more commitments, which is plus EUR 727 million. This year, only 1.6% more commitments were planned, and it looks as though we are making 10 times more commitments for research, but the only problem is, if we look at the payments, we will see that we cannot pay, because this year we are planning to make 13% fewer payments than in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">So the only thing I have to say at this moment is that we need to do our best – the Commission and everybody together – to ensure that deliverance of the scientific research projects will be of the necessary high quality to fulfil the commitments to be paid out. Until now, starting from 2007-11, this has not been the case, unfortunately. We could believe and work...</p>

However, they are also suffering as a result of the fact that, for years, high budget deficits – some of which are excessive – have been accepted and tolerated in a large number of countries. When we start to tackle the new 2011 budget it is not enough merely to reduce the budgets of the Member States. We also need to undertake a thorough review of the expenditure from our budget and also carefully review new expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention the European External Action Service, the structure and also the financing of which is still extremely unclear. There is no transparent structure. I would also call for cost-efficiency by using the synergies with national external action services. There must be clear rules regarding responsibilities and a transparent rendering of accounts to the European Parliament, and attempts should not be made to void the European Parliament’s codecision and supervision roles in more and more decisions. The European Parliament is cooperative and will also be supportive in difficult situations. For this reason, we must also involve the European Parliament in these matters as co-decision-maker.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think it is necessary for us at last to make the reduction in bureaucracy a reality, for example in agriculture and also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which urgently need to grow and to implement and cope with innovations. If we want to reduce budgetary deficits, as well as taxes, and increase tax revenues, we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium-sized enterprises and enable innovation, and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large-scale industry on unpopular small and medium-sized enterprises, and not encourage it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the view of the Chair of our Committee on Budgets that we first need precise data regarding this budget before we can finally adopt it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, as I listen to the comments, it seems to me that they reflect two opposite styles, two opposite mentalities. Some of us mention ever newer tasks and come up with ever newer ideas, urging a more effective and quicker implementation of our existing programmes. This is laudable, since these are good and important programmes. Others cite the difficulties faced by Member States and want to cut back the European Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s budget is not the cause of the problem but the solution. The tools we have at our disposal, if used successfully, can help improve the situation of every Member State of the European Union. I am thinking of support for small and medium-sized enterprises, of help for regions that have fallen behind so that they can catch up, and of support for agriculture in general. At the same time, we should not forget that we are now preparing for a trilogue and want to give a clear mandate to the rapporteur and Parliament’s delegation so that they may meet with success in these discussions. If we now go into minor details we will lose our most important messages.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree entirely with the socialists that the problem of Gaza is a very serious one, but I do not think that the trilogue this June is the right place to address it. If we are bringing in daily politics here, then why do we not speak of the floods in Central Europe? My own electoral district is also suffering enormously. The lives of families have been destroyed in the rains of the past few weeks. Of course we need to speak up, but Parliament has other tools at its disposal, just as there are also tools to resolve the Gaza problem. I therefore recommend that we support the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, under the Lisbon Treaty, we have competence for sport and tourism in particular: two areas that are very important to me.

Secondly, the budget for 2011, also under the mandate, leads us to the following conclusion – the proportion of fixed expenses is rising. In this area, as indeed others have said here, we must look at the effectiveness of these expenditures, by which I mean what results they bring. We still have a very important moment for reflection before us. What resources will be left for us to take new initiatives? The degree of freedom of resources for new initiatives is getting smaller.

As regards immigration: instead of stemming the flow of migrants into Europe and securing our external borders, Frontex’s budget for 2011 is to be cut. On the other hand, more money is to be put into the European Refugee Fund, the aim of which is the resettlement of refugees in the EU. Such a budgetary policy defies logic and will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the EU, financial aid for Palestine is to be cut. Instead, a significant increase in resources is being provided for enlargement, for example for the candidate country Turkey. I demand an explanation as to why Turkey, which has moved backwards rather than forwards, is now to be rewarded with more money. Eight million a year is still a significant amount.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of administration, Parliament must finally put a stop to the establishment of umpteen new agencies. It is unacceptable during times of economic crisis for the EU to indulge itself with an agency for every problem. In addition, the added value, in specific terms, provided by every existing agency needs to be examined and monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I mentioned at the beginning, I will ensure that all your comments and considerations are transmitted immediately to Mr Lewandowski.</p>
<p class="contents">As always, the Commission will try to act as an honest broker. We heard in the discussion today how many different wishes there are and how many political priorities you would like to have, so there is no question that this is a difficult exercise. I think it was Mr Garriga Polledo who said that, on the basis of his 16 years of experience, we have probably never had such a difficult situation. The same is true for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It was mentioned that the money will have to be spent wisely. I think it was Mr Lamassoure who said that it must be better spent. I can assure you that the Commission would like to work very closely with the European Parliament to ensure that the money that we get is spent as well as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for all your input. Just a few factual points: Mr Berman, on behalf of the Committee on Development, mentioned that development money – and particularly the fast-start money for climate change – should be additional. I am very glad to be able to say that the Commission’s fast-start money will be 100% new and additional. That is very important. Also, in response to what Mr Färm was hinting at – the necessity to ensure that this money will be aimed at the most vulnerable and least developed countries – that is also the case with the Commission money.</p>
<p class="contents">I think those were the only factual matters. I will bring the whole wish list and all the priorities, as they have been expressed here, to Mr Lewandowski. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, too, for your criticism, because that criticism and your comments on my work up till now and on the report will certainly help me in the autumn to formulate Parliament’s position as best as possible, so that we can obtain the best possible result from the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In summarising what you have said, I would like to mention several matters. We have to look on what is happening in connection with the 2011 budget as the cumulative effect of financial pressure resulting from priorities which we, as Parliament, have created, but which have also been adopted by the Member States. Priorities such as the fact that the European Union, according to the Treaty of Lisbon, is to be an important actor on the international stage, or that we have ambitious and very large projects relating to Galileo and nuclear fusion. These are all huge, expensive projects, which have not come from nowhere, and the fact that things are as they are for the European Union budget comes precisely from these new ambitions which have been adopted and now have to be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, as rapporteur for this House, it is unacceptable that ambitions which come with the Treaty of Lisbon, and which are also being promoted by the Council, should be financed at the cost of Parliament’s priorities. This must not happen. We, as the European Parliament, must have room for manoeuvre and the financial capabilities to put into effect the priorities which result from our work. This explains the list for our negotiations at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one important matter: I am pleased by the support of the House for my priority for youth, which I initiated in the Committee on Budgets. I also draw this to the attention of those of you who want the priority for youth to go further. Subsidiarity is a fundamental principle, and I would not like us to transfer Member States’ responsibilities to European Union level where this is not necessary. This is why we also need self-control.</p>

However, I feel obliged to comment on the attitude of the Commission and Council in respect of their responsibility in the budget procedure. It is June 2010 and the 2011 draft budget still fails to take into account the EEAS and a large part of the EU’s new powers following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. It also fails to give sufficient consideration to the Europe 2020 agenda objectives. Commissioner Lewandowski promised us a budget focusing on young people and education. However, if we look at the draft budget being proposed, the line for Lifelong Learning, the most important programme in this area, has been increased by only 2%, which is equivalent to the current annual inflation rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is reflected in the very, very tight margins in the EU 2011 budget, which could have a negative impact on the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. On the positive side, I would like to highlight the fact that youth is one of the key priorities in the draft budget. Unfortunately, the actual financial support proposed does not meet the expectations of the European Parliament. A great deal can be achieved with relatively little funding in the areas relating to youth policy in particular.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michael Cashman, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− Madam President, can I say, as I begin, I think we should really call these not ‘Millennium Development Goals’, but ‘millennium development challenges’. So often the word runs off our tongue – ‘the MDGs’ – but do we ever actually revisit what they are?</p>
<p class="contents">Back in the year 2000 when we were going through economic boom times, we made promises and we made commitments. Sadly, colleagues, those commitments have not yet been achieved. We are five years away from the date that we set, 2015, when we would tackle these major challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me restate them: the major challenges are extreme poverty and hunger, access to universal primary education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, AIDS, malaria and TB, environmental sustainability and global partnership for development: eight millennium development challenges which still remain challenges. And now, during this week, the EU will come together to hopefully forge a united position ahead of the September plenary at the United Nations in New York.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have to say the signs are worrying. There is a lack of commitment to that 0.7% of our gross national income that we said we would commit to taking on these challenges. In some of the least developed countries we are slipping way, way away from the targets that we need to be reaching mid-way through.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been some progress and, yes, the investment that we have made – and I use that term wisely – the investment that we have made so far has paid off. The maternal health improvements are there. Child mortality rates are low, low, low and, yes, the numbers of children dying are gradually decreasing.</p>
<p class="contents">But our problem is that, not only do we need more money to tackle these commitments, we now need additional finances to tackle the problems associated with climate change which are bedevilling the positions that we are taking in the developing countries and the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is why in my report I have looked at not only what we have done so far, but how much more we need to do. And that means looking at the big problem we have in the European institutions of policies, on the one hand, that want to deliver positive change and policies, on the other, which contradict and undermine that.</p>
<p class="contents">Think of trade, think of the common agricultural policy, think of the common fisheries policy. Without policy coherence our investment in these countries will never pay off. And it is investment. It is in our long-term economic interest to get rid of these MDGs, to achieve them and get rid of these problems that curse individual lives across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">So what I want to see is leadership from the EU. Not the minimum set that they can agree on, but a commitment to that 0.7% of gross national income, a commitment to additional financing; and we do not want a redefinition of overseas development assistance. There must be no tinkering at the edges.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have an interesting debate tonight. I want to thank the NGOs across Europe for supporting my report. I wish us tonight and especially in the vote tomorrow to put aside our political differences. It will not be a perfect report; nothing produced by this House ever is, but let me say this: let us not now use party political differences to take away from ourselves the opportunity to go for a united position at the United Nations and achieve the MDGs by 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They stand as a common framework to coordinate and check international development activities. They help galvanise development efforts and help deliver opportunity to millions of people around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite impressive gains, however, overall progress has been uneven among the different goals, across regions and within developing countries. 2010 really is a milestone. It is necessary to consider what we got right and what went wrong, and what have been the key successes and failures since the signing of the Millennium Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to reflect on how best to approach the next phase and how to accelerate progress in areas that are lagging behind. It is also critical that progress towards meeting the MDGs is robust and sustained. Strengthening country-owned institutions, policies and service-delivery systems will be essential, as will avoidance or mitigation of shocks and the promotion of broad-based economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cashman’s excellent report responds to the issues mentioned and gives powerful guidance for the European Union in preparation for the United Nations high-level meeting in September and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see a strong convergence between Mr Cashman’s report and the Commission’s communication, a 12-point EU action plan in support of the Millennium Development Goals. We need to respect our aid commitments of 0.7% of GNI by 2015 at the latest. We need to turn aid effectiveness from a good concept into tangible reality. We need to ensure that policy coherence for development becomes a strong tool to guide EU decision-making. We need to pay special attention to countries most off-track, including those in situations of conflict and fragility. We need to pay particular attention to the MDGs that are most off-track, at the same time maintaining an integrated comprehensive approach to the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agree that governance is central to the successful achievement and sustainability of the MDGs. The commitment to govern effectively is a basic condition of any pursuit of public development strategies and policy. With the delivery on other commitments we need improved predictability and effectiveness to support country-led developments that foster inclusive economic growth and increase public investments in education, health and infrastructure, enhance success to clean energy and promote low-carbon development. Our aid should act as a catalyst to accelerate domestic resource mobilisation to finance MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also say a brief word on the discussions we had in the Foreign Affairs Council today. I am broadly satisfied with the conclusions we have reached. There is a clear commitment to meet the 0.7% ODA commitment by 2015. Council adopted gender equality and women’s empowerment in the development plan of EU action for the years 2010 to 2015. Also, the 12-point EU action plan on MDGs proposed by the Commission is reflected rightly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has agreed to make a real step forward in terms of aid effectiveness, inviting concrete proposals from the Commission. I believe that, whilst we should not be complacent, it represents a package that will enable us to lead by example in New York. It is by no means perfect, but provides a basis for progress. Once again my congratulations on Parliament’s MDGs report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to say that it was interesting for me as an old Swedish parliamentarian to be here in the European Parliament and witness the attempts to reach consensus. We did not expect our groups to manage to reach complete agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Mr Cashman is saying – and I entirely agree with him – that we need more resources. However, I do not believe that it should always be a question of more taxes. I would say this: give the entrepreneurs free rein and give them a chance in the poor countries so that jobs are created. I do not believe that the moratorium proposed by Mr Cashman is a wise move either. However, I would very much like to underline what is stated in paragraph 47, which strongly urges us to get to grips with the discrimination against certain groups that is found in the many poor countries. This is something that I, and surely many other people, think is an issue that we need to spend a lot of time on in our discussion of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is talk about 0.7%. I would very much like us to talk about 1% of GNI, because I believe that the rich countries actually have a responsibility to ensure that they at least achieve this amount. Then there is another matter. I do not believe that it is particularly wise to take the decision that the countries must attain 0.7% even if we want to, because I believe that in many respects this would be a waste of time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these issues are urgent and, from a moral point of view, are the most pressing issues that this Chamber could be concerned with. The fact that people are dying of hunger and thirst should be something that all Members of the European Parliament find intolerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I greatly appreciate the realistic, logical approach adopted by the report’s author, Mr Cashman.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to note, 10 years after setting the Millennium Development Goals, that a range of progress has been made in combating extreme poverty, hunger and HIV, even though this progress does not go far enough. While identifying critical points in the process of achieving the MDGs, the Cashman report also presents options for halting the waste of funds earmarked for development aid, using a complex, but balanced combination of legislative and financial measures, as well as market mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress, first and foremost, how pleased I was to read within the report the recommendation being made to the European Union to allocate at least half of the aid granted to the least developed countries and to identify the groups in the direst situation in these countries, with a particular focus on the situation of women, children and people with disabilities, as well as to incorporate more effectively the interests of these vulnerable groups into its development strategies. These groups are in a critical situation in many regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In September this year, as has already been mentioned, we will be given, I hope, at the UN high-level meeting a more detailed overview of the situation regarding development aid. In fact, the Cashman report expresses a very well-structured point of view, which is based on a philosophy inspired by sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The MDGs allow us a unique point of entry into the human condition at the beginning of the 21st century. Therefore, it is critically important to come up with a new and fresh perspective, instead of offering that of the 20th century. It is a fact of our time that no development is possible without security, and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>. This is why we have tried to offer a more balanced approach to the MDGs, paying more attention to such regions as Central Asia, where poverty goes hand in hand with a lack of safety, insecurity, instability, forced child labour and even slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the autocratic regimes in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, ethnic violence recently broke out in Kyrgyzstan. Dire straits, combined with instability and violence, may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the region. If we need proof that no durable and sustainable development exists without security, we have it here.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, we cannot forget about extreme forms of poverty in such European countries as Moldova and Albania. Let us take, for example, some grave problems relating to health care. In Ukraine and Moldova 300 out of 10 000 people suffer from tuberculosis. The aforementioned countries do not fall into the category of least developed countries but they certainly fall into that of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If the MDGs do not embrace the least stable and least secure countries, we will never achieve a viable, social and moral order there. Therefore, the time has come to expand our horizons. Although sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to us, we cannot confine the MDGs to this sole, familiar context. We are facing new challenges and we have to react to them. Last but not least, the MDGs are inseparable from the necessity to empower the least developed, developing and least secure countries so that they can shape their future themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should have liked to see Mr De Gucht, the Commissioner for Trade, at your side, as we in this House are now endeavouring to catch up within the next five years. The Millennium Development Goals are by no means on schedule, and yet we all put our signatures to them; we made promises. We promised – and I still remember the slogan, as I was working for development organisations at the time – to ‘make poverty history’. History has yet to be written.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this can be done. We can talk about 0.7% of our gross national product in aid, and even more. We can talk about new kinds of financial assistance, though this becomes more and more complicated in these times of economic crisis. Yet what we should really be talking about is a different means of coexistence, through fair trade. We are now patting ourselves on the back for being the world’s largest providers of development aid, but in actual fact we should be patting ourselves on the back for being the largest consumer market.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to engage in fair trade, a great deal of the assistance would probably be rendered unnecessary. Somehow it still seems simpler to provide assistance than to undertake to stop undercutting African small farmers. If we limit the opportunities for multinationals to evade taxes, very many coffers in Africa will be healthier. Also, when I see our approach to the voting lists for this resolution, with all the additions and deletions, I ask myself what has happened to the grand gesture; what has happened to our signal that we shall really attain the Millennium Development Goals within five years? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is quite happy to give 99.9% support, with a few differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We keep talking about MDGs. What are these MDGs? Well actually there are eight Millennium Development Goals, and I think we should have had more. Had we had more, we would have achieved some of the targets that we have been trying to achieve faster. One of the things that is most important in eradicating poverty is to have stakeholderships, to be able to own something, to have property or to own a small business.</p>
<p class="contents">Members have travelled abroad and have seen millions and millions of slums in developing countries and hundreds and thousands of small businesses – garages, shops, repair shops, various people doing various things – at the side of the road as they travel in air-conditioned cars. The trouble is that none of those slums and none of those businesses are registered. They do not have a capital value. Should we be able to recapitalise those properties and those businesses, we would put nine trillion dollars’ worth of capital assets into the hands of the leaders of the developing countries. Yes, nine trillion. That is larger than the entire debt that we have been worrying about in Europe and more than value of the stock markets in New York, London and Tokyo.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have not found a way to capitalise on those properties and those businesses. They are outside the legal system. Had we been able to do that, we would have been able to eliminate poverty faster. This is what has happened in other parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also expect the Member States to be aware of their obligation to implement the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the obligations to which they have committed themselves, namely to pay the relevant share of the development aid. Mr Cashman quite rightly said that, as the European Union, we have a deficit of EUR 20 billion. What needs to be brought to the forefront is a very clear statement that we are fighting for these Millennium Development Goals to be implemented by 2015 and we will not allow this to simply be postponed to a later date, always with the justification that, at the end of the day, as Member States we would not be able to do this on account of the effects of the crises and we would be fully justified in postponing it. However, the fact that more than a billion people are living in poverty and hunger – there are even 1.5 billion just living in poverty – proof that in recent years poverty has even increased in certain regions of the world, in the sub-Saharan region for example, leaves us no other option than to insist very clearly on what we want in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I would also ask my fellow Members, particularly those from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), not to water down the report any further with your amendments. This report represents a balanced mix of real demands, requirements and the necessary pressure that we need to exert, and we should not retract anything from any part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would even have gone further in a few places. I would also have made very specific demands for us not to sign or bring into effect any other treaty that does not serve to implement the Millennium Development Goals. In my view, we have come full circle. We not only need a coherent policy within development policy, but it has to be important for EU policy as a whole to engage in a tangible way in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe has a great opportunity: that of presenting itself as a world partner for development. The information we have is still alarming: in 2009, a billion people suffered chronic hunger, and this figure has risen today with the economic crisis. We must add to this the damage caused by climate change, a factor that continues to magnify the problems that we have been trying to keep under control.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that the targets we set ourselves in 2000 were certainly ambitious and could only have been met by donor countries. In the light of these commitments toward developing countries, it is sad to see that some European countries are falling so far short of their agreed commitments. It is disappointing, for example, that my country – Italy – is now contributing a distressingly low 0.16% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We must introduce a binding commitment for all countries to reach 0.7 % of GDP by 2015, as established by the European Commission.

For example, we can use the reform of the fisheries policy to support fisherwomen and fishermen in developing countries rather than industrialised fishing companies. We can use the CAP reform to focus on sustainable agriculture and eliminate all direct and indirect export subsidies – and we can stop ACTA, for which the Commission still has not delivered the proof that it will not hinder access to medicine and technology transfer.

It must also adopt, as a matter of urgency, specific new measures enabling us to honour all our promises of solidarity with the most disadvantaged groups on the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions adopted by the Council just today mark, from this perspective, a step in the right direction because I would say that Europe needs to remain in the forefront of combating poverty and a credible partner in the global pact for development, entered into by accepting the Millennium Development Goals. In order to achieve these objectives we need, as you are all aware, not only to find new development aid resources, but also the political will to turn these objectives into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think it is the right time for us to consider integrating automatically an approach based on human rights into all the measures adopted with the aim of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Respect for human rights and the promotion of mechanisms fostering accountability are extremely important in terms of improving the conditions of those living in poverty and, ultimately, of achieving the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight some problem areas in the Cashman report. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) cannot accept the unilateral introduction of a Tobin-type tax, as specified in paragraph 8, because it is hard to reconcile this with the idea of funding global public goods.

Prior to the financial crisis, we in Europe, as rich industrialised nations, had promised the poorest countries USD 50 billion for this year, 2010.

Even the agreed twelve-point action plan, according to which the wealthy countries want to give 0.7% of their gross national income in development aid, will not be fulfilled. Some countries are setting a good example, but my country, Germany, does not look good.

<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful about his paragraphs 48, 49 and 50 on food security. I actually think his explanatory note is much stronger than the paragraphs in the report, because we have a real problem in the European Union. We are spending less and less of our development aid budget where it is needed most – that is, in subsistence agriculture and among peasant farmers. The figures – and they were in our resolution on food security in January 2009 – are as follows: we have reduced the amount of development aid devoted to agriculture and rural development from 17% in 1980 down to just 3% in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the Commission will tell us what actions they are taking to address that – and I see a nodding head, so I am hopeful – and also to get governments in African countries to recognise that hunger exists in the rural areas where people could actually farm if they had the tools.</p>

Even though the intermediate goal was to increase aid to developing countries to 0.56% of global GDP, today we have only reached 0.3% at global level, in other words half the planned goal, and we have only reached 0.4% at European level. To this is added the ethical dilemma as to whether the resources at our disposal are being channelled where they are needed, to those who really need them, and are not being squandered through corrupt practices and governments.</p>

I would just take a couple of points that I think require some clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">The Millennium Development Goals should and can be achieved, and I say this with full responsibility. It is not only my view; it is also the United Nations’ view. It is the view of the developed and the developing world and we need to make an effort.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that this House calls very strongly for commitment of 0.7% of GNI. I know that it is part of sovereignty that every country decides on its budget, but, if Parliament will not call for it, who else will do it with such a strong voice? It is true that we need to be accountable, but Parliament has a lot of power in this issue. You should not underestimate your strength on this issue, and I believe that it is very important that it should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important also to strengthen our relations with sub-Saharan Africa. I know that there have been a lot of disappointments, but being new in this job and really looking for all the complex of issues with the colonial past, Cold War years, and development, I believe sub-Saharan Africa deserves particular care and particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The trade issue is important to address and it should be fair trade, but we know that until now these unilateral trade preferences have not helped the countries evolve. They have not been substantial in regional trade either, and our approach now is really to create fair trade conditions, investment for trade and in particular looking for regional trade. I believe that is the right approach and we need to strengthen it. I will work together with my Trade Commissioner. He was, for a short while, also Development Commissioner and he takes these things very close to his heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax evasion and illicit flows are an important issue but I believe that part of the responsibility lies with the G20 and us to make a very strong global system so that tax evasion and illicit flows are impossible. We also pay particular attention in our projects to support a property register, because, definitely, growth is not possible without a strong property register and legal systems that support it.</p>
<p class="contents">On rural and food security issues, it is true that it is a focus of our policy, but part of the money for food security comes through our budget support and that way statistics do not always correctly reflect them. We need to think how to better reflect them, but a clear commitment is demonstrated by our food facility and the money put towards its construction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finish with a call which Michael Cashman made: that this report really deserves cross-party support. I know that some issues are divisive but they should not divide Parliament in strong support for this report. We need this support because society needs it and if Parliament will give overwhelming support for the report, it will be easier for the Communities that care for development cooperation policy really to push forward this agenda and be more successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I absolutely agree with you.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been an interesting debate. I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs, who I have really enjoyed working with – Mr Svensson, Mr Donskis, Mrs Sargentini, Mrs Zimmer and all of the others. My memory sadly escapes me – it is something to do with age. Let me say about age – I do not want to live more years and witness more suffering, more hunger, more poverty, and increasing mortality rates amongst women giving birth and amongst children under five. I want us to see these MDGs achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to those who have spoken with some reservation about elements of this report: let us not turn around to our citizens and say that we failed to agree and we failed to vote in favour of that report because it had elements within it that I could not vote for. What kind of signal does it send to people living in poverty and deprivation – without water, without access to health care, without access to education, without access to an equal life – that somehow in a debate in Brussels there were elements within a report that prevented us from doing the right thing for the majority of this planet?</p>
<p class="contents">I urge all the colleagues here today to please vote in favour of this report tomorrow – not for me, because Michael Cashman will go back to a home with running water, with health care, will be loved and hopefully be nursed into amnesia and old age. But think of that child or that woman dying in childbirth, think of that child dying through malaria or diarrhoea or TB or AIDS or HIV, and of the young woman denied access to education so that she cannot empower herself for the rest of her life. Think not of us here but think of those outside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eradicating poverty and hunger, providing access to education and improving health, among other things by combating disease, must be given the highest priority in the Millennium Development Goals. The European Union must make an urgent contribution to development cooperation as part of its trade policy and international cooperation. Its main objective must be to promote the autonomy, independence and initiative of the relevant countries. It is also important to ensure that the financial measures in this area have the desired impact and achieve their clearly defined objectives. In my opinion, one of the key models for a sustainable circular economy based on fair rules is the eco-social market economy, which is based around small-scale, multifunctional agriculture. The aim of the Millennium Development Goals should therefore be to promote a small-scale agricultural model which is independent and resistant to crises, has the farming family at its heart and encourages the development of expertise that has grown up out of the local culture and is designed to meet regional needs. This sustainable form of agriculture is a means of developing regional independence and guaranteeing the supply of food, while taking environmental and social factors into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title20"></a><a name="creitem20"></a>

I believe that the compromise we are debating today meets these conditions. This compromise has been reached after countless discussions, which, unfortunately, were brought about occasionally by pressure being exerted by parties involved in this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has made a positive contribution by introducing the annex containing the first new corridors. This initiative speeds up the implementation of the Regulation, even though I feel that the timeframes requested by Member States of three and five years are, in some cases, excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">The corridors are established on the basis of certain criteria, the most important of these being economic efficiency. Every corridor will be managed by an executive board and a management board. They will coordinate the implementation of investments, the drafting of the timetable, development of the terminals and standardisation of regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable will still be drafted in accordance with Directive 2001/14/EC. A single point of contact will be established for allocating capacity within the timetable already approved. This is a great step forward in terms of both transparency and efficiency for the transport company business.</p>
<p class="contents">Freight does not have any priority. Passenger traffic will not be disrupted. On the contrary, it may have advantages, thanks to coordinating decisions at corridor level. If traffic is deregulated, the rules decided on at corridor level will be applied in order to keep to a minimum the period required to return to normal operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Council’s agreement to open the corridors to all the relevant beneficiaries is another major benefit of this Regulation. It is also possible that Member States will not get involved in creating a corridor for important reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis triggered by the volcanic ash highlighted the lack of coordination of railway traffic at European level. Companies missed an important opportunity to demonstrate that rail traffic can offer an alternative to air traffic. In fact, the enforcement stage of the First Railway Package shows us very clearly that this sector does not have a genuine internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This Regulation marks a step forward in terms of making rail freight transport more efficient. It remains up to Member States to fund the development of their rail infrastructures. I firmly believe that the needs of the market will highlight the benefit of these investments. During the current crisis when there is also the need to cut carbon dioxide emissions, it is obvious that transporting goods by rail is a positive factor which must be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Liberadzki, Mrs Bilbao, Mr Eppink, Mr Cramer, the Spanish Presidency and, especially, Jesús Izarzugaza and the staff from the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I must also express my thanks to Mathieu Grosch for the support he has given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we are at the end of the second reading, and the Commission would like to reaffirm once again – and in the strongest possible terms – the political and industrial importance of the subject on which Parliament has to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the adverse economic cycle we are in, there are some clear lessons to be learned: how to revitalise the rail freight sector, because rail freight transport is primarily international, and an indisputable factor in its success is the availability of good-quality rail infrastructure at the European level. That is what the customers ask for. Good-quality rail infrastructure across borders is an essential condition for the competitiveness of many rail freight market segments, and it is primordial if rail wants to compete with other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">This also explains why the Commission proposed, at the end of 2008, the development of a European rail network for competitive freight based on freight corridors. These corridors link the main industrial regions of Europe, where the most substantive flow of goods originates and terminates along the main international axes. The legislative proposal to which your attention is drawn today contains decisive elements which favour this development of high-quality rail infrastructure at international level. These include cooperation between rail infrastructure managers, reliability of infrastructure capacities allocated to the corridors, good coordination between rail infrastructure management and goods terminal management, and non-discriminatory access to these corridors for all operators.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s position at first reading maintains the basic principle put forward in the Commission’s original proposal but waters down some of the elements. The TRAN Committee has reintroduced, at second reading, important amendments which strengthen the regulation, and they bring back the original Commission proposal. The Commission considers that the compromise obtained during the negotiation is balanced and that the general objectives of the Commission’s proposals are duly taken into account. We are very grateful to Parliament in that it has succeeded in reinforcing the role of the one-stop shop, which had been reduced to a mere mail box in the common position of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, rapporteur, that some people want to go back to the common position. I invite you and Parliament to resist these attempts, because they would weaken the compromise that you have been able to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">For the railway undertakings and for other applicants which wish to have access to the corridor infrastructure, the one-stop shop is a considerable simplification of the present, very burdensome procedure, because the one-stop shop will be able to take decisions itself instead of referring matters to the individual infrastructure managers, which cover only national sections of each corridor. But, of course, the one-stop shop is limited to catalogue or reserve capacity: that is, the capacity which the infrastructure managers themselves have already decided to set aside for freight trains. Corridor managers have also several options as to the way in which the one-stop shop should be established.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise that the one-stop shop is a joint body set up or designated by the management board of each corridor: its function is that of a coordination tool. It may be a technical body within the corridor management structure, or one of the infrastructure managers concerned, or the bodies already established by Rail Net Europe. So it is not a supranational body, but it is a tool which speeds up and simplifies, in a very transparent and non-discriminatory manner, the path allocation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The infrastructure managers have the responsibility to predefine capacity. The one-stop shop just sells paths to applicants on the basis of decisions already taken by infrastructure managers on the predefined infrastructure capacity. Some have gone as far as saying that, with this regulation, the Commission wants to give priority to freight trains over passenger trains, thus threatening the efficient provision of rail passenger services, in particular at regional and local level. Now let me be very frank: this is improper, it is not the right reading of the proposal, and it does not correspond at all to the texts that everybody can read in Article 14, in Article 15. Priority rules for trains are not something the Commission will ever want to decide from Brussels. Freight traffic is systemically discriminated against today because passenger traffic always has priority, even in cases of disturbance.</p>
<p class="contents">What the text says is that the infrastructure managers themselves must take the responsibility to define transparent, consistent, non-discriminatory rules for both types of traffic so that freight trains which are on time do not have to be systematically delayed in case of disturbance. This is, I believe, a very good compromise, and if you parliamentarians adopt it and if it is also then correctly implemented, the Commission is convinced that it will contribute to the revitalisation of rail freight and will help the European economy to start again after the present crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You hit the nail on the head today: the creation of an integrated rail network for freight transport is, for us at least, absolutely essential and extremely important. For the companies, it will ultimately lead to a practice that they are not keen on, as past experience has shown. It is the practice of simply working together with other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently talked about liberalisation. We subscribe to liberalisation together with the Member States, but 21 Member States are managing to do nothing when it comes to rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now talking about freight transport. We should not normally need to draw up this sort of regulation. We want to help make freight transport more efficient. Study after study shows that we need to transfer more traffic from the roads onto the rails, and with every initiative aimed at thinking in European terms with regard to rail transport, there is always one or another company or country that says: no, we do it better and you should accept our rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done together with the Commission and the Council. We are in favour of this cooperation. We would stress that passenger transport remains a priority, as laid down in 2001. We want transparent rules at the outset to prevent haphazard decisions being made in crucial situations. All of this is intended to give those who profit from passenger transport as well as the infrastructure managers in the country itself all the confidence they need to be involved in this. But no, they do not want that! Why is that? Quite simply because this directive will set a new emphasis that will eradicate certain monopolies, including certain national monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The rail system of tomorrow cannot work like this. I therefore hope that tomorrow we will have a broad majority that will vote in favour of this compromise that we have arrived at together, and that the 40 signatures, which mainly come from my group, will not receive the support of the majority. In any case, I would like to thank you for your work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise two key points. Firstly, what we want is competitive rail freight transport. Secondly, we want the regulation to give full added value. My political group sees the chance for added value in the fact that we will begin to create the structure of a European rail area, something along the lines of a European Single Rail Market, so that we can move from state railway systems to a European system.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions and solutions which were most important in ultimately persuading us to support this regulation are, firstly, the one-stop shop as a concept which is convenient for the customer. Secondly, the fact that we want to open nine corridors in a system which covers the continent, so for the first time it will be possible to cross state borders with the involvement of all interested states. Thirdly, we are talking about the fact that this is an opportunity to increase interoperability. For what is the reason for the poor fortunes of the railways? Very low interoperability. Fourthly, we have created conditions in which we can, within five years, determine strategic investment needs. Finally, there is a timetable, so that we do not put off the project indefinitely and so that there will be an institutionally unified method for the management of each transport corridor.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the points which persuaded us to give our support, and it may be they will be promising points, if the pessimistic scenario described by Mr Grosch does not materialise, in other words if the railways want to be a business and an industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to achieve this objective for energy efficiency and environmental reasons, but also because consolidating some genuinely trans-European rail corridors will increase flexibility, efficiency, intermodality, and options for the movement of goods in particular and for logistics in general. These are both basic factors for the competitiveness of the real economy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Behind the decisions that we are adopting today, there are many hours of hard work that have made improvements to the initial draft. It is right to establish regulations regarding the characteristics required in order for a section of railway to achieve categorisation as a European corridor, because this will help the state and regional authorities to plan, coordinate, and understand each other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important that institutions at all levels are integrated into this planning, because it is more efficient in terms of optimising investments and also because it is a really visible way of integrating and building Europe from the ground upwards and making everyone feel that they count in European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what we have been hearing and reading in recent days, I would like to say that it is also an improvement to give each corridor a one-stop shop as a management tool. It is the most efficient and most balanced option from a purely political point of view, it is more appropriate to the ideas of subsidiarity and proportionality, and it fits in with the idea of the European project. The one-stop shop will be able to take decisions for itself, which will simplify the current processes as well as being a transparent and non-discriminatory way of allocating paths.</p>
<p class="contents">The managers also have various options regarding how to set up the one-stop shop. I would also like to say that, as Commissioner Reding said, this regulation does not prioritise freight transport over passenger transport. This is also something that has been said, and it is not in line with the interpretation of Articles 14 and 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all the groups for their work in including a section of the rail project that is very important for my country: the ‘<span class="italic">Y Vasca</span>’. This is an important issue for an economy such as the Basque economy, which is obviously an export economy, and clearly improves the prospects and possibilities for developing our commercial ports, which will play an important role in the future as a basic element of what is known as the ‘Motorways of the Sea’.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that we will also be able to improve transparency and the integration of Parliament’s role in the future project, because it has been somewhat laborious to arrive at our position in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance do not want to prioritise freight transport. We want the greatest possible degree of flexibility in order to use the available capacity efficiently for all types of transport by rail. We do, however, want a one-stop shop as a point of contact for customers.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention now, however, is for this one-stop shop also to decide on the train paths. For countries with heavily used rail networks and mixed modes of transport, that will be a disaster. I still find the current wording incomprehensible. I therefore consulted qualified lawyers and economists. However, even they could not help me, and, in any case, we will not support a contradictory linguistic monstrosity.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the amount of funding has been reduced by almost a third, from EUR 20 billion to EUR 8 billion, the number of corridors has been increased from six to nine. That is simply a refusal to face reality! There are four problems, for example, with corridor 3 – Stockholm-Malmö-Copenhagen-Hamburg-Innsbruck-Verona-Naples-Palermo. In Hamburg there is a bottleneck, the fixed-link Fehmarn Belt crossing has been cemented, the two Alpine tunnels that have just been completed in Switzerland are being ignored and the bridge across the Messina road is intended to be a European project. The more cost-effective, shorter and faster alternative is the connection from Copenhagen via Rostock to Nuremburg through the newly built Alpine tunnel to Naples. We want to stop climate change with an alternative transport policy. Pointless large-scale projects, coupled with a refusal to face reality, will only gobble up money. That is why we reject this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current European rail network needs improvement and coordination in view of both the congested road network and environmental concerns. Many EU Member States have for years failed to maintain their rail network, which has favoured the transport of freight by road. We are now paying the price for this. It is high time that we gave the operation of trains a higher political priority. We need action and a new vision of rail transport in Europe in general.</p>
<p class="contents">But – for there is a ‘but’ – the railway is not a magic or problem-free solution. It has its Achilles heel. Freight has to be taken from the place of production to the railway by lorry, after which it is transported by train to a station near to the end user. It is then transferred to another lorry for the last stretch. This automatically makes the product more expensive, prolongs the transport time and increases the administrative burden. So, unless we locate all of our industrial production right next to a railway line, these drawbacks will remain.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at the national situation in the individual Member States and see how it can be improved and coordinated. We need to consider how we can work together instead of imposing some form of harmonisation on the Member States from above. Our Member States and our rail systems are very different and we need to respect that and use it as the starting point from which to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text has developed between the two readings, and seems to be going in the right direction. In the year since we began discussing this issue, I have noticed that the public – at least in my region – is baffled when they see how little coordination there is between rail companies today.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we, in this House, legitimately call for more ambition with regard to the environment? Should we merely express our regret that Copenhagen was not a complete success, when we in Europe are incapable of actually shifting our freight transport to rail, either purely to rail or to multimodal transport?</p>
<p class="contents">Some sectors of multimodal transport have developed, and it has taken time for road hauliers to adapt, but they have been able to appreciate the complementary nature of this system and demonstrate that it is effective. We cannot have a debate today if nothing comes of it afterwards; we have an obligation to act, and to act quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, beyond this text, there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure. I would particularly like to draw your attention, Commissioner, to the issue of cross-border sections. They are often nobody’s responsibility, yet they are the link we need to successfully complete our European project.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also heard some parties, and more specifically the social partners, express the fear that some powers may be lost. However, I am convinced that the success of this project will provide an opportunity for us to work harder, and to work harder together. I feel this is very much an issue on which Europe can show its practical side to our fellow citizens. We certainly need this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the result is an important one and one to be proud of. After all, over the last 20 years, rail freight transport has almost systematically lost market share to the roads, and it was also hit hard by the economic crisis. Therefore, measures need to be taken to give rail transport a further boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the present Regulation is just one means to improve the competitiveness of rail freight transport. A whole range of other measures will also be necessary, for example concerning technical interoperability and financing of infrastructure. Other necessary measures include optimising the operation of the market and promoting intermodal transport. Clearly, however, the development of international freight corridors facilitating the passage of freight trains through Europe is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘one-stop shop’ system opposed by some of my fellow Members is actually a way of making the corridors easier, simpler and more transparent for potential customers to use. It is not a duplication of what national infrastructure managers are already doing today. On the contrary, it complements their work and ensures better coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those fellow Members who have emphasised that this Regulation will not be to the detriment of passenger trains. However, clear prioritisation criteria do need to be established to optimise the deployment of freight and passenger transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we still have a few differences of opinion, that is due to the fact that we have different experiences in the various Member States in terms of the functioning or non-functioning of the rail network.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Germany, where it would be terrible if freight transport took priority over passenger transport. That would have a very negative effect on local public passenger transport. At the same time, we are very well aware that we need a continuous system in Europe. This is something that we want as well as need. There is just the question of how it will be implemented, how many corridors it will have and then, of course, also who will now lay down the one-stop shop rules, who will allocate the train paths. There are completely different opinions on this. Some people think that we would create a parallel system if we had a one-stop shop per corridor and not functional national one-stop shops, which should perhaps be included. That is the only source of dissent that we have. Otherwise, we all agree that we need this freight transport in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, there are still provisions in this regulation which I find controversial, both in the context of the competitiveness of rail transport and of the entrepreneurial independence of rail infrastructure managers. I have in mind those provisions, and mainly the new paragraph to Article 12, which give the right to assign infrastructure capacity to the one-stop shop for each corridor, in so doing violating the exclusive right of the manager in this respect and restricting his independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find very controversial the proposal of paragraph 3 that in the case of other work, the manager shall inform the one-stop shop that it has been assigned, and the one-stop shop shall give an answer to the applicant. The possible communication of a refusal via the agency of a one-stop shop will, without doubt, increase bureaucracy and delay the process of assigning a train path, reducing at the same time the possibility to react with flexibility to the changing needs of carriers. It is obvious that this might reduce the competitiveness of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Also very doubtful are the provisions of paragraph 4, which constitute a breach of the principle of confidentiality of commercial information. Instead of ensuring the transparency of operation of one-stop shops, this may become an instrument for fighting the competition by using dishonest practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the conference the Commission, Parliament, the Spanish Presidency and the EU transport ministers reconfirmed their diagnosis: the proportion of freight carried by rail is seriously declining, even in countries that were leaders in the field not long ago, such as Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also an agreement regarding the treatment to be followed: the need for shock therapy in order to reactivate this traffic, firstly if we want to fulfil our Kyoto commitments to reduce emissions and also due to the urgent need to diversify the alternatives to rampant road traffic before there is a total collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore an urgent need to increase the quota of freight carried by train, but this needs to be done at European and cross-border level, with a vision for the future. This involves trains that are 900 metres or more in length on continuous or priority corridors with full security, as proposed through the European Railway Traffic Management System.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this issue is so important. I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Marinescu and all those who took part in the negotiations on the commitment that it represents, which is still an initial commitment with the possibility of other corridors being included. I am particularly grateful that it has been made clear that a strong synergy is already planned with the review of trans-European networks. That is why I would particularly like to acknowledge and express my thanks for the inclusion of freight corridor 16 when it is completed, and for the importance of dry or inland ports as well as sea ports.</p>

Using a sledgehammer to smooth the way for European network management will not solve the existing problems. On the contrary, centralising and fragmenting the responsibilities will generate new problems. If freight trains have priority in future, it will put passenger transport, which we want to promote for environmental reasons, at an even greater competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU cannot call for environmentally sound behaviour, make motoring more expensive by means of biodiesel regulations and then, by means of privatisation regulations, separate off secondary lines from rail transport and dictate that there should be freight corridors on the large interconnections at the expense of passenger transport. Particularly during peak traffic times, we need to proceed in a sensitive way here, so that we do not penalise commuters.</p>
<p class="contents">Shifting competences from the national infrastructure operators to the one-stop shops will result in a fragmentation of responsibilities and thus in an inflation of the bureaucratic apparatus. By weakening the national entities, the intention is clearly to successively set up Europe’s own infrastructure operators, which is neither sensible nor appropriate. The rules contained in the regulations will, in addition to the loss of competence, result in a loss of capacity as a consequence of the early train path applications. Therefore, the proposed compromise that is on the table should, in my opinion, be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With global warming and volcanic ash, people are more amenable to travel by rail and to send freight by rail. There are difficulties, I know, but the gains are immense in terms of cost, in terms of less pollution, less log jams, less accidents on the roads.

It is also supported by the Commission and a statement to this effect will also be made tomorrow. The compromise is supported by the European associations of hauliers and infrastructure managers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a single amendment tabled under pressure from a single operator in the rail freight transport market which is actually playing, in my view, a deceitful game. Discussions are going on in the local press about disruption to passenger transport, while the amendment tabled in this House actually refers to getting rid of the single point of contact which provides transparency and ensures fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval of this amendment will lead us to a conciliation procedure and will remove any added value from the Regulation’s text. This Regulation will become useless without this single point of contact, making too few changes to the current situation. There is one point which I would like to mention to you. The statements made in this Chamber about the single point of contact allocating capacity are not true because capacity is allocated in accordance with Directive 2001/14/EC just as, at the moment, infrastructure managers also decide about the route to be taken by the freight trains and about making reservations for ad hoc requests, while the one-stop shop carries out this allocation process within these decisions already made by the infrastructure managers. Therefore, I am sorry, but the view maintained by anyone else is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The current compromise has been achieved as a result of difficult negotiations. The current text includes exactly what the freight sector needs: traffic coordination, investments, management, standard rules in the event of disruption, easy access to the free market for applicants. Conciliation cannot give us any more than we have now. On the other hand, it may weaken the Regulation’s content, making it useless. I would find it strange if a single company were able to win a case against the Council, European Parliament and European Commission. It goes without saying that my recommendation and request are for a vote in favour of this compromise in the form in which it is currently presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sarah Ludford, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− Madam President, it has been recognised by most of us for over a decade that the EU needed to act to strengthen the rights of suspects and defendants throughout the Union and to give safeguards necessary to ensure fair trials. This is in the context of much tighter cooperation on policing and prosecution, the introduction of the European arrest warrant and the fact that many EU citizens take advantage of free movement rights and may have a brush with the law in an unfamiliar environment.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an attempt at a comprehensive measure on so-called procedural guarantees, one that MEPs strongly supported, but that ran up against a brick wall in the Council in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that last year the Commission (and I am delighted to see Vice-President Reding here for this debate), supported by the Swedish Presidency, revived the matter in the form of a road map of half a dozen individual measures. This is the first to see the light of day. This directive says that, if you become a suspect or you are arrested, questioned or put on trial and you do not understand the language of the country, you have a right to interpretation and translation, under certain conditions, for police questioning, hearings, meetings with your lawyer and so on. Broadly speaking, you have to be put in the same position as a local.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis of cooperation between Member States in criminal justice is mutual recognition, the almost automatic recognition of the decisions of courts in other EU countries based on mutual trust, but it is not sensible just to assume that trust exists. It has to be earned through full respect by all EU countries of certain standards of justice and fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us in this debate have probably dealt with cases where we do not believe someone got a fair trial. I have recently dealt with the case of Garry Mann, who was returned to Portugal under a European Arrest Warrant. In the original trial both the charge and sentence were delivered orally. Mr Mann did not know what he was charged with until after he was convicted. The interpreter was a local hairdresser, a friend of the judge’s wife. When he was deported back to the UK he was given a simple letter in English effectively saying not to come back to Portugal for two years, yet years later a European Arrest Warrant was issued to summon him back to serve sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lack of a proper and professional language support has also figured as one of the defects in the case I am dealing with in Greece of Andrew Symeou.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this measure is not only to make sure that Member States are implementing Article 6 of the European Convention, but also to further develop its minimum standards. As the road map last November said, there is room for further action on the part of the EU to ensure full implementation in respect of convention standards and, where appropriate, to ensure consistent application of those standards and to raise them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Parliament made good use of its newly acquired Lisbon Treaty powers of joint responsibility for legislation. We fought hard with a lot of help from Vice-President Reding, to whom I pay tribute, and her officials, to raise standards on certain key points, including interpretation of communications between the suspect and the lawyer in all phases of the proceedings, the right for the suspect to challenge the decision that there is no need for interpretation or translation, and also the right to complain on quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We secured the right to limit recourse to partial translation, so all essential material must be translated and oral exceptions must indeed be exceptions, and that the suspect should not be allowed to waive the right to translation without prior advice. Those are just some of the key points.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I believe strongly in the European arrest warrant, but we need the road-map programme to strengthen citizens’ rights and make it work better. Strengthening safeguards and defence rights is not at all about being soft on crime. It is about being tough on crime. Good efficient justice through high-quality decisions means catching more criminals, and cutting corners on costs is not best value since if you get a poor court decision or bad police practice, then people are going to appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Cheap justice is no justice. I therefore commend this directive to you. I thank the Spanish Presidency, with whom we have a good process of negotiation as well as with the Commission, and I will deal in my summing-up with the plenary amendments being tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>− Madam President, that is right. Procedural safeguards represent a top priority in the justice area for the coming years because we need those minimum standards for the rights of the defendants in criminal proceedings. They are indispensable to promote real mutual trust between the judicial authorities of different Member States. Without this trust, mutual recognition will never work properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Judges and prosecutors must be confident that, no matter where the proceedings take place in the Union, a common core of basic rights will be upheld. Citizens must be sure that minimum standards for procedural rights will enforce their trust in our justice system and also in the EU as an area of freedom and security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I warmly welcome the agreement reached by the two co-legislators. I would like to give specific thanks to the rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, and the whole LIBE Committee for their excellent work on this file.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner, I am pleased that many of the compromise solutions take inspiration from our March 2010 proposal. The proposal was meant to reach what Parliament has now reached, namely to ensure high standards for defendants and to avoid any risk of falling below the European Convention on Human Rights <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The directive, as it is now on the table, will increase the minimum standards. Consistent provision of interpretation throughout criminal proceedings and translation of essential documents will simply result in the right to a fair trial being upheld in a more systematic and streamlined way. I fully agree with the rapporteur that cheap justice is no justice and leads to more costs in the end as well as to a lack of trust from both judges and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very glad that it was possible to have a very swift adoption of this directive. This is the first step on the road map which indicates that all institutions are living up to the pledge they made to treat this file as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one element with which I have to disagree, and that is the request by some Member States to extend the implementation period to 36 months. The Commission considers that three years is excessively long because none of the Member States submitted any evidence that the implementation of this piece of legislation would be very difficult. In addition, the Member States also knew that this legislation would be adopted and have already known this for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, in a spirit of compromise, I will accept the solution. What I say now is very important for the future. On the understanding that this will not set a precedent for future road map measures – and I would like to underline this three times – I will say ‘yes’ this time but not again. I would also like to emphasise that the Commission will deploy all the necessary resources at its disposal to enforce the Member States’ obligations concerning the timely and correct implementation of the decision. This is in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty and with the Stockholm Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission is already working on the subsequent road map measures. I will very shortly be putting forward a proposal on the right to information – the letter of rights. This will be presented in the coming week, so what we have initiated today will be work in progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The existence of common standards is an essential condition for instilling mutual trust in Member States’ legal systems. The right to a fair trial for suspects or defendants is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. However, failing any suitable standards in terms of the defence process, there is the risk of creating imbalances between the instruments which the prosecution has available and the degree of protection afforded to the rights of suspects or defendants.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts have been made to consolidate procedural rights in the European Union for a long time. The initial steps were taken in November 2000 when the Council, in accordance with the Tampere Conclusions, adopted a programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. This was followed by a proposal from the Commission on a framework decision for certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings in 2004. An agreement could not be reached and negotiations were abandoned in June 2007. Then came the road map from the Swedish Presidency in July 2009, which proposed a gradual approach to procedural rights. The Commission tabled a proposal in July 2009 and in December 2009, after the Treaty of Lisbon and the amended legal framework had come into force. Finally, we have the initiative from the 13 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are now, after almost seven years, on the way to adopting the first measure featuring in the road map for procedural rights: the Directive on the rights to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings. I wish to say how pleased I am with the outcome achieved following the negotiations between institutions. The text we are due on Wednesday to vote on makes significant improvements to the Member States’ proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the three-year implementation period is not going to set a precedent for the subsequent measures in the road map and that Member States will make every effort to apply all the provisions of the Directive as quickly as possible in a proper, consistent and fair manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the first text under the ordinary legislative procedure in which Parliament has had a decisive voice regarding the draft directive put forward by the three Member States, and it is important that a British MEP was the rapporteur for this text.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the Member States have used the prerogative granted by the Treaty of Lisbon on criminal judicial cooperation in order to put forward initiatives, but the lack of progress on procedural rights since 2004 was partially resolved by this first right on the road map put forward by the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The way was open, and it was temporarily blocked by the election of the new Commission. In this case, the Commission also decided to put forward its own draft directive, which it was drawing up. Parliament made amendments to the Commission’s work. This has therefore been an example of good institutional cooperation, so that no time is wasted and these primary procedural rights can be introduced more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">This meant that the work could be sped up. We now hope, as the Commissioner has just said, that the remaining rights, the Charter of Rights, which is the second in the package of procedural guarantees, will be in Parliament as soon as possible. We also hope that the rest of the package will come soon, as it would be pointless for it to be delayed so that we could not complete it within a reasonable period.</p>
<p class="contents">As the other speakers have already said, the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be created if we do not begin with the principle of these procedural guarantees. How are we going to live in a safe, just and free area if Europeans can be arbitrarily detained and become suspects, if they do not have these procedural guarantees, these minimum standards in the Member States? In that case, what is the significance of the Europe that we want to build?</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as other speakers have also said, that the threats of terrorism and organised crime require us to strengthen our security measures, and an example of this is the European arrest warrant. We are all aware, however, that if we do not have this Europe of justice and freedom we will not have designed the future that we want.</p>

In this regard, I could mention the European Arrest Warrant, for example. In return, however, the fundamental rights of citizens accused of crimes are being left out of the legislation. Up to now, all attempts to secure the guarantees afforded by the rule of law in criminal proceedings throughout the EU have failed to achieve the requisite unanimity in the Council or to receive mutual recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have new opportunities for protecting the basic procedural rights of citizens in criminal proceedings. Now, for the first time, the European Parliament has the power of codecision, and only a qualified majority is now required in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are in favour of protecting and continuing to extend citizens’ rights. Therefore, we have also worked to ensure that, in future, all EU citizens will have the right to an interpreter and to a written translation if they are arrested by the police or brought before a court as an accused person in a Member State whose language they do not speak or understand.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital not only that criminal proceedings be better coordinated across borders, but also that the rights of citizens in criminal investigations and proceedings – for example, the right to a fair trial – be adequately available to citizens throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent teamwork with all our shadow rapporteurs.

This relates to the languages which are covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the reference to ‘interpretation and translation … in the native language of the suspected or accused person’ in paragraph 10(e) of the agreed text. However, there is a danger that the provision ‘or in any other language that he understands’ could be used to limit the choice of languages and to force the accused or suspected individual to use a language which is not of his choosing, a language which could put him or her at a disadvantage when dealing with potentially complicated legal issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commissioner promise that this is not the case and that this directive also relates to minority languages?</p>

Whether the country is Portugal, in the case of Garry Mann, or Hungary, in the case of two south-western constituents, there is simply not the same legal protection for the individual as pertains in the United Kingdom – whatever illusions have been pedalled in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore this translation directive is a fig leaf. It is trying to stick plaster over the near-decapitation of Britain’s hard-won liberties at the hand of the European Arrest Warrant. I would note that, even in its own terms, this directive is flawed. The decision as to what is relevant for translation lies largely with the prosecutor. Moreover, there is a chronic and absolute shortage of translators and interpreters, not least because the institutions of the European Union absorb so many.</p>
<p class="contents">Our distinguished colleague, Baroness Ludford, has characterised herself many times as a campaigner for human rights. I would ask her, therefore, just this once to put aside her obsession with a federal Europe and join our campaign to repeal the European Arrest Warrant.

The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will be voting in favour, but we will not be voting for the amendments which will be tabled, so as not to upset the delicate compromise which has been reached. During this speech I would, however, like to address the somewhat ambiguous situation which has arisen between the Council and the Commission with regard to the presentation of this legislative proposal. In fact, not one, but two proposals were tabled. Last December we had a legislative proposal by the Council of Ministers, and in March of this year the Commission presented another proposal about exactly the same subject. The question which arose before this Parliament concerns the ambiguous matter of which text we are we going to work on in this Parliament. In fact, I do not think this is the first time that something similar has happened, and nor will it be the last. In fact, we have to deal with another proposal from the Council of Ministers concerning the European Protection Order, while the European Commission has already declared its intention to present its own proposal. The Council is asking us to accept its proposal – I am referring to the proposal regarding the European Protection Order – while the Commission is asking us not to accept it. Those who drafted the Treaty, who empowered the Council to present its own legislative proposals, certainly never intended to create ambiguous situations of this sort, where two institutions argue about whose proposal should be accepted. In my view, in cases where the Commission intends to present a proposal, it should be allowed to do so, while the Council should refrain from presenting its own proposal. Otherwise, we would end up in situations characterised by ambiguity and bickering, which are best avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first of the five measures on the Council’s roadmap to be realised. The directive is of fundamental importance, since at a time when we can live and move freely within the territory of the European Union, it is important for a citizen to be able to understand, in circumstances as difficult as the commencement of criminal proceedings, what is happening to him or her and be able to make himself or herself understood.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative, arising from the context of the Stockholm Programme, is one of those that give concrete reality to the fundamental aims of the European Union. This is what lends EU law and Community efforts a sense that they are dealing with the actual lives of people, and renders the Stockholm Programme accessible to citizens. I unfailingly support the inclusion of the relevant provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human Rights. After Lisbon and on the verge of our accession to the Convention on Human Rights, this is only to be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I consider it important to draw attention to an essential issue that the report does not address. Citizens who belong to a national minority, often quite a large one, within a given Member State should have the same right to use their native language in criminal proceedings as citizens who find themselves by happenstance in that Member State. Moreover, it is precisely under this measure of EU law that that person will be able to use his or her native language.</p>

<p class="contents">This new, gradual approach starts with the right to translation and interpretation in criminal proceedings, and is the first of six planned measures on the road map. The right to a written translation of important procedural documents does not currently exist in all Member States. Even when it does exist, this right can vary considerably. The right to interpretation between suspects and their lawyers, for example, is not always guaranteed. This directive confers these rights on anyone suspected or accused of committing a criminal offence until the proceedings are closed.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the agreement reached in the trilogue. The compromises achieved respond to most of the concerns raised by Parliament and to those resulting from the Commission’s proposal. I congratulate Commissioner Reding on having put forward a good proposal in the first place, and I congratulate Baroness Ludford, our rapporteur, on the compromises she was able to obtain on most points.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly emphasise the written translation of documents essential to the proceedings and the guarantee that the level of protection should never be inferior to that laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Member States will quickly implement what has been agreed and will not leave transposing this important directive until the last minute.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased to hear Mrs Reding assure us that she is going to put forward more road map proposals straight away, and I would like to encourage her to do so. We have to make it clear that we are consistently building the Europe of justice, and not just the Europe of security and the Europe of freedom. Finally, I am pleased to see that all the Member States apart from Denmark will be covered by these rules, since both the United Kingdom and Ireland have exercised their right to opt in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been very nice to lay down even more requirements for the translators, because what good is a translation if you cannot guarantee the quality of the translator?

<p class="contents">The European Treaty of Lisbon gives us the possibility now – by giving us the tools – to move forward step by step, putting in place the rights of the citizens, be it the rights of the convicted, or the rights of the victims. Everything is in the pipeline and will come quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The question related to more proposals forming part of the road map: yes, after the right of interpretation, which I am sure the House will endorse tomorrow, there will be the right of information, the letter of rights which I will put on the table of this House before summer. That will then be followed by the right to legal advice and the right to communicate with people who are dear to the heart.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see we are going in a direction which aims to achieve the following: the same high level of rights for all EU citizens wherever they are, whatever their problem. It does not matter whether they are travelling for study, for business or for leisure: they should feel at home, and have the same rights as they have at home, wherever they find themselves in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One very important question which has been underlined by several members is the question of language. Article 2(1) and Article 3(1) state very clearly that the accused person who does not understand or speak the language of the criminal proceedings concerned has to be provided with interpretation and a translation of the documents. Now this implicitly means that the language into which the proceedings are translated is the language that this person understands. So in fact it does not concern only European Union languages or minority languages. It concerns the language of the person who is in front of a tribunal. I believe that this is only fair because we have to have fair proceedings in order to build the trust of the citizens in our justice system and also, and this is of the utmost importance, in order to ensure the mutual trust of the judges and the prosecutors in neighbouring countries’ systems, which cannot be achieved unless we also have a comparable level of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one question by Mr Busuttil and other Members about procedures – not about procedural rights, but about internal procedures – due to the coexistence of a Member State initiative and of a Commission proposal. Well I must say that in this case this really did not hamper in any way the swift adoption of a very high-quality and balanced legislative instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did it happen? We are now in a very peculiar period. We are coming out of the third pillar and find ourselves in a normal codecision situation. I suppose that after some months we will have learned how best to utilise the tools which are at our disposal in order to reach the best solutions very swiftly. And when I say reaching the best solutions, I mean in the way we used to prepare such solutions: by having an impact assessment, by also having a call for people to come in and say what they think about our proposals. These are the normal proceedings which we are used to and which will guarantee in the end, via the codecision procedure and after having a public consultation and an impact assessment, that we achieve sound policy. Sound policy which then can be implemented at national level without creating more distortions than rights, as unfortunately has happened in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are here with a new Treaty, we are here with a Charter of Fundamental Rights, we are going to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. I am very confident that, if we should meet together some years from now, we will say, yes, together we have constructed that area of justice and fundamental rights which our continent must become. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased we are debating and voting this directive this week, still under the Spanish Presidency. It is historic, being the first criminal justice measure negotiated under codecision and the first EU fair trial law.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly agree with Vice-President Reding about the three-year implementation period. It was very cheeky of Member States to slip this in unilaterally after we had reached a Council-Parliament deal. They will not get away with it again. I say to UKIP that there is no call to get nationalistic about the quality of justice. I am strongly critical of the lower UK standards that developed over the last decade like control orders, which are house arrest, and 20-day detention without charge. I hope the new government returns fully to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that my country and Ireland have exercised their opt-in to participate, so this directive will cover 26 countries. This directive is in the spirit of Magna Carta, habeas corpus and the Bill of Rights, whereas UKIP would let bank robbers and terrorists escape justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the amendments, Mrs de Brún explained the amendments on the rights to use European regional or minority languages. While having sympathy with their motivation, I have to oppose them because they do not in fact fit the directive. The test in the directive is one of comprehension and ability to express oneself, as Vice-President Reding said. It is not about the right to choose as such, so there has to be a procedure of verification of the person’s ability to speak and understand and, if they do not accept the language offered, the option would be to challenge the decision. Member State national laws specifying minority language rights are unaffected, although in practice those rights are arguably increased in that if the speaker of a minority language is unable to understand the proceedings then the directive’s rights apply equally to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask that the directive be passed unamended and quickly so that it gets on the statute book. I look forward to Commission proposals on the further road map measures – the first expected in about a fortnight – and I know that in the hands of our feisty champion, Vice-President Reding, they are in very good hands.</p>

When the suspect is a foreign national, language barriers present a significant problem for conducting criminal proceedings efficiently. If court decisions are to be recognised without reservation by other Member States, minimum trial guarantees should be in force in each country. The right of the accused to be informed of the charge in his or her own language is undoubtedly a fundamental element in the right to a defence, without which no trial can be a fair one. The draft directive on interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings will, therefore, serve its purpose here, irrespective of whether adequate principles are already in force anyway in EU Member States. I am very pleased that, by way of a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, Parliament has finally given up the introduction of many unreasonable demands which could have paralysed criminal proceedings, particularly in more straightforward cases. I am convinced that the draft directive in its present form will serve to build trust between the justice systems of Member States, while also respecting their different legal traditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Edward Scicluna, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− Madam President, I am pleased to be able to present this report endorsing Estonia’s application to join the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very significant that a small, but highly determined, EU Member State comes knocking on the eurozone’s door during such difficult times. It says a lot about the country and it says a lot about the euro and the eurozone as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why Estonia should join the eurozone is straightforward. Estonia has met the Maastricht criteria laid down in the treaties. More importantly, we need to keep in mind that these achievements were reached during the worst global financial, economic and social crisis we have seen in our lifetimes. Such achievements, it must be said, are the result of determined, credible and sustained efforts by successive Estonian governments and the Estonian people. Moreover, despite the eurozone’s recent difficulties, public opinion in Estonia is strongly in favour of joining the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have been in constant contact with the Commission, the European Central Bank and the Estonian Government and visited Estonia in the middle of May when the Commission and the ECB published their convergence reports. The preparations made by the Estonian Finance Ministry, Parliament and Statistical Office and the Central Bank are a credit to Estonia.</p>
<p class="contents">I must raise my concern, however, at the extremely short time that Parliament is being given to present its report following the publication of these convergence reports. I do not think it is appropriate. As has been stated in the past, it demonstrates a lack of respect for Parliament. I admit that there have been some noticeable improvements, as when the Central Bank and the Commission met with the Bureau and gave an oral explanation of progress. However, I sincerely hope that this timetable will not be followed next time a country wishes to join the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there may be some who say that the eurozone should sort out its problems before taking in new members, in my opinion this would be a short-sighted approach. As members of the eurozone, we are either confident and motivated enough to see our way through the stormy seas the euro is passing through or else we lose our heads in a frenzy and refuse an able and qualified Member State which wants to join the euro and is ready to give a helping hand in the time of need.</p>
<p class="contents">In our battle to restore confidence in the eurozone with measures to improve the sustainability of public finances, through tighter statistical governance, my opinion is that Estonia will be a real asset to the eurozone. Its prudent approach to public finances meant that, by the end of 2009, it comfortably had a very low – if not the lowest – government budget deficit in the eurozone. Meanwhile, despite a massive contraction of the economy by nearly 15% in 2009, the fact that it had rebuilt up large surpluses during the good years has meant that its government debt to GDP ratio is, at 7.2%, easily the lowest in the EU and one of the lowest in the world. Put plainly, during the worst economic and social crisis, Estonia has kept its house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">This puts Estonia firmly in the group of eurozone countries which are more fiscally disciplined and prepared to take the tough choices to maintain sustainable public finances. It also carries significant political symbolism. Estonia’s application to join is a significant symbol to its neighbours that joining the euro should be an attractive option for those countries which prepare themselves well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this is not to say that an easy economic path ahead lies ahead for Estonia. Unemployment is extremely high, for one thing, and the inflation risk for the future is also not very good. Therefore the Government needs to maintain vigilance over prices, especially during the changeover period.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I commend this report to this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also want to congratulate our Estonian friends on reaching this important milestone.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the overwhelming support for Estonia’s euro adoption given by Parliament’s ECON committee on 2 June. It is indeed crucial in bringing the Commission proposal further and eventually introducing the Euro in Estonia on 1 January next year.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the convergence assessment and the decision on Estonia’s adoption of the euro will take place against the background of one of the most difficult times for the euro area – if not the most difficult time – since its creation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect this positive assessment on Estonia is an especially important signal, showing that the EMU framework is fully functional. It also underscores that, in the convergence assessment, Member States are examined on the basis of their own performance, on their own merits and with full respect to the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive assessment on Estonia is also a strong positive signal for the markets as well as for the non-euro area Member States at this current juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that Estonia would enter the euro area from a very strong position with credible policies, one of the strongest fiscal positions and by far the lowest debt level in the EU, as Mr Scicluna illustrated. While the average in the European Union is currently around 75% public debt, Estonia has a debt level of 7.2%, which is of course a huge difference from the average. While not immune to the crisis, the Estonian economy has also shown its ability to operate and adjust under a fixed exchange rate regime for close to two decades since 1992. Therefore euro adoption itself is not expected to be a major shock to financing conditions as financial deepening is already well advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, euro adoption will not be the end of the road; quite the contrary. Should Estonia adopt the euro next year, it will be key to maintain policy discipline and fully gear fiscal, structural and prudential policies towards a successful performance within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the willingness of the Estonian authorities to reassure euro-area and EU partners through a formal letter stating their firm commitment to stability-oriented policies and setting out policy priorities accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, there is a pressing need to strengthen economic governance in Europe. The Commission’s recent proposals aim at both substantial deepening of economic governance in Europe and prudent widening of the euro area on the basis of the countries’ own merits.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the way to build up a stronger and more effective economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, after this week’s consultation with the European Parliament, the issue will be followed by a discussion in the European Council later this week. Should all go as planned, we expect to have all relevant legal acts adopted by the ECOFIN Council on 13 July, thus giving Estonia sufficient time to prepare for the changeover and for the adoption of the euro on 1 January next year.</p>
<p class="contents">So, once more, many thanks for your support for the proposal, and my warmest congratulations to the Estonian people! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can support him in the general thrust of his comments and also in the concerns that he raises.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I say in particular that we are able to admit Estonia to the euro area because of sacrifices made by the Estonian people and the leadership given by the Estonian Government and Parliament. This leadership goes beyond simply putting their house in order and making the sacrifices that go with that. While some of us are licking our wounds, being very uncertain about the future and wondering about the eurozone, here is this small country showing the way. It is a beacon not just for the other countries in that region that aspire to join the European Union, but a beacon for the whole of Europe to reinforce our confidence at this difficult time which will pass.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the House while I am on my feet that, during the first 10 years of the euro, 16 million jobs were created within the European area – many more jobs than were created at the same time in the United States. This really is therefore an endorsement of the whole project at a time when it needs endorsement by a courageous parliament, courageous government and courageous people. I welcome Estonia and I think they are doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience from my country – another small country – has been almost entirely beneficial. Think about where small countries would otherwise be. Where would we be if we did not have the European Central Bank and the Commission and the fellowship of the eurozone ministers in these difficult times? We would be truly lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Two points I want to raise concern the issue of boom-bust cycles, which has to be addressed and does need to be monitored, and that of asset inflation. I was raising this with the President of the European Central Bank for two years before it became popular to talk about it. The Commission and the ECB have to somehow come to terms with how low inflation and low interest rates also give asset inflation. There has to be some way of dealing with that.</p>

Then it will be a little less than a month before the Council’s official decision. For Estonia, joining the euro area is the next transitional milestone in the European Union’s integration process, and accession is a natural part of the wise budgetary policy that has been practised in Estonia over a number of years. As early as the start of the economic crisis, our society realised that the challenges arising from the crisis required a completely new approach and a rethinking of many of the policies that had been pursued up to that point. Specifically, this meant several budget cuts in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession means that the efforts made in recent years were correct, and the developments of recent years have also shown how important it is to have credible statistics and to avoid double standards. I am sure that Estonia will continue its very appropriate, transparent and reasonable fiscal policy in the future. We have realised that, in a small country with an open economy, there is no other option. Estonia’s accession is a positive sign to the whole of Europe. We have faith in the single currency as a reassuring light at the end of the tunnel in the complicated economic situation we face in Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that once Estonia has joined, the euro area will have a member which understands the rules of the game, and which will be useful in strengthening monetary union and the single currency. For my part, I wish to thank colleagues, namely the rapporteur, Edward Scicluna, and the shadow rapporteurs for their substantial work. I would like to assure you that Estonia is ready to join the euro area. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Baltic neighbour, as previous speakers have already said, is actually one of the very few countries that meet the Maastricht criteria, and indeed with enthusiasm!</p>
<p class="contents">In the current climate, we can be certain that the Commission, Eurostat and the European Central Bank have looked very closely at everything and made no allowances in their evaluation of the figures. The Council will also take its decision without any political benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after its introduction, the euro is, as we all know, currently facing its greatest test and challenge. It is testimony to an enormous degree of commitment, an unbelievable will and an extraordinary amount of effort that Estonia has succeeded in actually meeting the accession criteria under these circumstances. I believe that it is also evidence of the fact that it wants to meet these criteria as laid down in the Treaty. Estonia knows that, as a Member of the European Union, it is also obliged one day to become a member of the euro area and the fact that it wants to do that so quickly makes me, personally, very happy. It shows that there are still countries that have real confidence in this European project.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fortunate that the Estonian Government did not have to put this accession decision to the people in a referendum, as we are well aware that citizens are to some extent very concerned. If they follow the media, they will view the euro as a soft currency and the euro area as a transfer union, and they are scared that the introduction of the euro will lead to large price increases. Slovenia and Germany are examples of this, and in Germany it is not without reason that the expensive euro has been referred to using the play on words as the ‘Teuro’ (‘<span class="italic">der teure Euro</span>’ – expensive euro). The fact, then, that all of this is just perceived inflation, as the European Central Bank says, is surely something of an understatement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the euro area, Estonia will also have to deal with the problems facing the single currency and thus also sign up to the euro area rescue plan. What impact that might have on the budget, we do not know. I would like to ask the Commission to provide some clarity in this regard. I hope Estonia continues its excellent development and I hope that its achievements, particularly with regard to budgetary discipline and combating inflation, will prove to be sustainable in future, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The value of a country’s currency must reflect the relative demand for its exported and imported goods and services, as well as other monetary movements, and must change according to need. A country tied to a currency value that does not reflect the needs of its economy will find that any economic problems are aggravated.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom found this when we were members of the predecessor of the euro, the Exchange Rate Mechanism. We found ourselves locked not only into a single currency value, but also into a recession from which we escaped only when we left the ERM.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scicluna report congratulates Estonia on replacing current and capital account deficits with current and capital account surpluses. This appears to be good news, but there are dangers on the horizon. This surplus might result in the Commission and the European Central Bank setting the kroon-euro rate at too high a level. If Estonia then suffered a decline in the value of its exports relative to imports, a recession and balance of payments deficit would follow from which it would not be able to escape. Estonia will lose its monetary and fiscal sovereignty, and therefore political sovereignty, which is ironic for a country that only 19 years ago escaped from the clutches of the Soviet Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We expect the team with the best discipline and the greatest commitment to win the World Cup. This sort of logic should also be applied in the event of euro area enlargement. Budget discipline and the implementation of reforms must be rewarded by admission to the euro area. During the world economic upswing from 2005 to 2008, the majority of European states spent a good deal more money than they could afford; they lived beyond their means. They prepared the ground, in fact, for today’s euro crisis. During this time, while others were spending money, our friends in Estonia were somewhat cannier – they were storing up budget surpluses. It is thanks to these surpluses and their budget discipline that the steep economic downturn that they experienced also in 2009 did not bring Estonia to the verge of bankruptcy. Instead, by observing strict discipline, Estonia meets all the Maastricht criteria and it should be admitted to the euro area. The introduction of the euro in Estonia would be good news on three fronts. First, it would be a very important and powerful signal internationally that, in spite of all the difficulties, the euro area continues to expand. Second, it would be a positive signal to all of the Baltic States and the Baltic region that the Baltic States and the region are stable and capable of following pragmatic policies. Third, it would be a very important signal to Latvia and the other euro candidate countries that abiding by the Maastricht criteria will be crowned and rewarded with admission to the euro area. At this time in Europe, the Member States must put their budgets in order, so that their populations and the financial markets can regain their faith in the euro area. To my mind, the admission of Estonia to the euro area will serve as a good example to the governments and societies of other countries of the fact that budget discipline is possible even in very hard times.

The Baltic tigers became the sick men of Europe following an economic boom lasting several years. Nonetheless, we now have Estonia preparing to join the euro area in record time. However, this country’s accession will strengthen the euro area at a critical juncture. We applaud Estonia’s ambition to adopt the single currency in spite of the crisis which has not left it unscathed. It has been able to tackle it with prompt austerity and fiscal discipline measures. Although they have been hit hard by the crisis, the Baltic countries have enjoyed the advantage of having a low level of public debt, which provided them with greater flexibility in relation to external loans. This is an important point to remember, bearing in mind that Estonia’s public debt to GDP ratio is 7.2%, far below the 60% reference value.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is now time for us to learn the lessons from the European crisis and from Estonia’s determination and for us to successfully find the happy medium between ambition and prudence. However, as part of this process, we must not ignore the social aspect of migrating to the euro. The experience of States which have previously joined it highlights major risks in terms of price rises. This is why I hope that the Estonian authorities will be able to apply balanced fiscal policies so that its citizens are not obliged to make major sacrifices. In this respect, Mr Scicluna is quite right to draw attention to the risk of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, Estonia’s transition to the euro also has a symbolic aspect. It can serve as a model for countries in Eastern Europe whose enthusiasm has been dampened by the crisis, along with a decline in their real chances of meeting the deadlines for adopting the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me use this opportunity to inform you of the reasons for the tight timetable for adopting the convergence report to which Mr Scicluna referred. The cut-off date for the assessment depends on the availability of the forecast data, which itself depends on the date of the validation of the public finance data by Eurostat. In fact, to give the European Parliament more time, Eurostat agreed to advance the validation of the fiscal data. Still, the production process of the report by the Commission is very tight because we want to ensure a quality product, and squeezing it further would not be feasible without compromising the overall Union-wide assessment of all Member States, not least as regards the excessive deficit procedures and the overall respect of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is the very foundation of the economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact we will use the same raw material tomorrow in the Commission when we take decisions on, in total, 16 excessive deficit procedures – 12 existing and four new excessive deficit procedures for the EU Member States. So it is indeed an overall Europe-wide process and that imposes some limitations on the Commission’s work in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I appreciate your pragmatism and I might say that I met members of the ECON Committee on 13 April to have an informal advance dialogue on the convergence prospects for Estonia. I would also like to add that the Commission is ready to inform the Parliament at any time regarding the economic and fiscal situation in Estonia. It is clear that Estonia must stay vigilant to ensure the stability of its public finances and macroeconomic development, and the Commission will certainly monitor this very vigilantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I count on having Estonia as an ally in pursuing fiscal discipline in terms of exercising peer pressure in the Eurogroup. We need allies to that end, and I count on Estonia in that regard. We need to work together in order to ensure the sustainability of public finances and thus sustainable growth and job creation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was Mr Brons who referred to Estonia supposedly losing its recently regained independence and its freedom. Maybe I should respond to Mr Brons by saying that perhaps it would be relevant to mention the reasoning followed by my grandfather when he voted ‘yes’ in the referendum in Finland on Finland’s EU membership, some 15 years ago. He said to me that he spent five years on the front to defend his country looking to the East, but since then he had always looked to the West. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that Estonia’s efforts to meet the Maastricht criteria have been duly recognised, and I hope that colleagues will support the report in Wednesday’s vote. The adoption of the euro in Estonia on 1 January next year will take place at a crucial time for the entire euro area. The global economic and financial crisis exposed those Member States which have systematically evaded the jointly agreed criteria, and which have thereby jeopardised the other Member States’ economies. This crisis is extremely enlightening, and it is especially important that all the Member States in the euro area, as well as the European Central Bank, are diligent in making sure that the Maastricht criteria are always fulfilled. The criteria become essentially meaningless if Member States are allowed to deviate from them and get a free ride at others’ expense. Although a precedent has been created, we cannot rely on rescue packages to compensate for the irresponsible economic and financial policy decisions of Member States. The Estonian Government has had to make several difficult, but necessary decisions in order to stabilise the national budget and stop the economic decline. Estonia’s imminent accession to the euro area is testament to the fact that the government’s action has borne fruit. I hope that the other Member States are also ready to adopt measures which will guarantee European economic and financial sustainability and competitiveness, taking into account the structural changes taking place in the global economy. Estonia’s accession to the euro area sends an important and reassuring signal and gives us reason to believe that the single currency, with its recent trend of decline, will soon stabilise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title24"></a><a name="creitem24"></a>

Together with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Slovakia is also hugely affected by the flood waves. The solidarity of the European Union is thus extremely important at the moment.

I would like to ask the Commission to mobilise any possible resources to help mitigate the damage, since no Member State has the necessary reserves to repair such extensive damage.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem to which I would like to call attention is the discrimination arising from the amendment to the Slovak Nationality Law concerning those who, after 17 July, may adopt a second nationality besides that of Slovakia, irrespective of whether this is the nationality of another Member State or of a third country. Within the meaning of the new law, citizens applying for dual nationality will not have access to a range of jobs, for instance they will not be able to become civil servants, or even firefighters, on the grounds that they represent a security threat to the State.

The reason for taking this position was the tragic death of a detainee on hunger strike. The Cuban regime responded cynically and declared that it would not give in to international pressure. In the light of this precedent, it is incomprehensible that during the Spanish Presidency, we increasingly hear voices claiming that the European Union must review its Cuba strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The world has changed and we must soften our approach, this is more or less the line of argument. Indeed a lot has changed in recent years, but Cuba’s oppressive dictatorship has remained. Therefore the basic prerequisite for any <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> between the EU and Cuba must continue to be that the communist regime first make gestures and release its political prisoners as soon as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, the common EU foreign policy approach cannot be besmirched by compromises in the area of human rights. Our common foreign policy must be marked by consistency and credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The complaint concerns an environmental crime: 320 000 tonnes of highly hazardous waste dumped in an open tip in a densely populated area of northern Portugal between 2001 and 2002, contaminating soil and water. These are products with extremely high levels of lead, zinc, cadmium, chromium and arsenic. Although the Portuguese national authorities have been alerted to it, they have taken no action.</p>

Therefore, Madam President, I am also appealing to the European institutions to intervene. I have already approached the European Commission to ask for this intervention. Today I am lodging this complaint with the European Parliament, and I hope that the resolution that I intend to table can be debated and voted on, so that people’s health is no longer put at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to make two comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy has been explained in accordance with a familiar formula: the mental instability of the murderer. The same argument has also been used to explain other religious murders in Turkey. The diagnosis was made almost as soon as the investigation began. It is easiest to pigeonhole the whole affair and then classify the perpetrator as a religious extremist.</p>
<p class="contents">Second comment: I am surprised that no senior European politician has reacted at a political level, except for the Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). This shows how the work of the media is bearing fruit. Where a Catholic issue is involved, they react in whatever way suits them. They either remain silent, or they unleash a hate campaign.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for the fact that he now wants to do something practical in this regard. Mr McCreevy – your predecessor, Mr Barnier – needed to be goaded into action. In your case, we are certain that you will submit proposals for the regulation of the financial markets quickly, reliably and correctly and be able to implement them together with us. All I can say to you is that you are doing the right thing by not waiting for the last one in the convoy or the disruptive influences in the Council. You have Parliament fully on your side with a clear and fair regulation of the derivatives markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted the report in committee with a broad majority – 43 in favour, 1 against, 1 abstention – and some of the professional observers from other Member States were surprised that, following the controversial debate, a regulation was produced that received such a high level of support. Everyone tried to find suitable compromises, even with regard to the two points that up to now had been contentious: governance, the conditions for the clearing houses and, secondly, the wording concerning the third states regulation, on which we have had intensive and contentious debates. You have today set in motion a public consultation procedure with regard to two sub-areas – the documents have been available since this afternoon – these areas being, firstly, short selling and, secondly, derivatives and market infrastructures. I believe that we need more stringent rules in this regulation and, now that the first part of the financial market crisis has to some degree been overcome and the second part is before us, that we should not allow an enormous market encompassing twelve times the gross world product to remain unregulated. This includes the OTC derivatives, but it also includes other points, and we all know that this is only part of the financial market regulation, not all of it.</p>
<p class="contents">A financial market crisis and derivatives that are not traded on the stock exchange have doubtless made the crisis worse. The accounting rules from the United States and the netting in internal banking operations have obstructed transparency, and the credit default insurance on government bonds, in particular, has fallen into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Greece, too, there is no proof that credit default swaps have caused the crisis. On the contrary, it is quite clear that it is not speculators, but the debt problems of the Member States that are the primary cause. Thus, we will only be able to solve the problem if we solve the debt problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified another problem from the experiences of the past few years, and that is that the market power of the six largest institutes is a problem. These six largest institutes – of which three are from Europe and three from the United States – are responsible for 80% of the derivatives market. We remember the experience of 1992 when there was speculation against the British pound and when, under the name of Soros, the accession of the British pound to the euro was prevented, and also the past experience of individual campaigners, who noticed at that time that some central banks had to use up all of their resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The market needs rules. It must be strictly regulated and the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs comprise a total of 48 individual points: standardisation of derivatives, trade repositories, the establishment of central counterparty clearing houses, use of organised trading venues, enhancement of market integrity and market oversight, derivatives for companies and end users must be regulated separately and we need the aforementioned ownership rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to assure you, Commissioner, of the unconditional support of Parliament with a broad majority. Do not sit at the back and follow everyone else, but be at the forefront and you will have us at your side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been clearly shown that the lack of transparency in this field can cause the build-up of unknown risk in our financial system. However, Mr Langen’s report also recognises that derivative products also serve the opposite purpose of dispersing risks for businesses, small and large, which are going to be the foundation of economic recovery in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament has clearly voiced its opinion that many end users should be exempt not just from clearing, but from collateralisation and capital requirements as well. Although I do not agree with everything in Mr Langen’s final report, particularly with regard to the banning of certain types of products, as I believe this needs considerably more research to avoid the financial innovators finding simple way of rebranding or engineering even more complex products to get around overly prescriptive rules, I am, however, confident that the process of European and global law-making continues and that we will come up with a workable and effective solution for derivative instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Derivatives are considered to be one of the basic causes which helped trigger the financial crisis. With the aim of preventing new crises, the proposals drafted by the Commission on the derivatives market will reduce the risk these instruments pose to the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to restore confidence in the financial markets, a legislative framework is required which will help increase transparency and help the market players make an accurate assessment of the risks involved. In the short term, reducing counterparty risk is an important objective. This can be achieved by using central counterparty clearing houses more frequently. Transactions need to be centralised through a central counterparty in order to increase transparency. In this respect, central counterparties help preserve the integrity of the stock market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a timely report that is of a high quality and that is economically and politically important. Mr Langen has asked all the right questions – which, knowing him as I do, does not surprise me – and has adopted and proposed an ambitious point of view. I believe that this is indeed the right approach to this issue, given its financial and economic importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, you are all aware that, when discussing the derivatives market, we are talking about a market worth USD 600 trillion, and about products that are used daily by banks, but also by businesses, to cover potential fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates, or volatility of oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Swinburne said, these products are useful to our economies but, at the same time, they can be a source of risk and currently fall outside any form of transparency or registration. That is what we need to change and what you, Mr Langen, propose in your report. It is also the approach that the Commission announced in its communication on the derivatives markets in October 2009, and which I personally confirmed to Parliament on 13 January 2010, as you may remember. This proves, Mr Langen, that I intend, as I said on 13 January, to be in the driving seat and not in the passenger seat.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely with that aim in mind, I would like to confirm my intention to submit a legislative proposal on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives this summer – at the beginning of September to be precise. The objectives are clear: we want to increase transparency, establish a general standardisation process, and strengthen the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also do all of this swiftly, effectively, and without improvising. Parliament’s assessment is on the table; my services have been working for several months and have maintained a constant dialogue with all the parties involved. In fact today we launched a public consultation to finalise our proposals on some specific aspects. I would like to mention, for example, the criteria that must be adopted in order to make derivatives clearing mandatory; not all derivatives can be standardised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the type and level of prudential risk management requirements, which we have to have with regard to clearing houses; Mrs Băsescu rightly raised this issue. These clearing houses should enable us to reduce systemic risks, and we must be very careful to ensure that they can succeed by establishing all the conditions they require to perform that role.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the conditions under which clearing houses in third countries can offer these services in Europe. Another issue is the potential interoperability between clearing houses and the issue of trade repositories; these are key infrastructures, since they will compile all information on transactions. How should we regulate them? Should we demand that they be established in the European Union? These are all questions to which we will pay close attention, and we should be mindful of the answers that we will be given. We will also take into account the results of this consultation in our impact assessment and in the legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight a few more specific points from the Langen report. Firstly, I have taken note of Parliament’s concerns over the ownership of clearing houses and the risk of excessive control of these clearing houses on the part of their users. I, like you, Mr Langen, want to be aware of any potential conflicts of interest but, at the same time, we must consider the fundamental European Union rules in the area of freedom of investment, and these rules do not sit well with the regulation of clearing house ownership. However, we will continue to work on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a sensitive matter and one that I do not wish to avoid; I raised this question in consultation and, in any event, we need strict governance mechanisms in order to minimise any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted your preference for clearing houses and central repositories to be located in Europe. Personally, Mr Langen, I am in favour of such an approach. That is why we presented three different options with regard to trade repositories in our consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if these facilities are to be located partly in Europe and partly elsewhere, the challenge is to ensure that all these entities are indeed subject to the same rules and that our competent authorities have direct, immediate and unconditional access to the information they need.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also expresses a preference for giving the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) a powerful role in authorising the supervision of clearing houses and in registering and monitoring trade repositories. This is also a very important issue on which we must continue to work. Mr Langen, responsibility in the areas of supervision and authorisation is linked to tax liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Granting supervisory responsibility to ESMA would mean that, in theory, ESMA would also assume budgetary responsibility, which is difficult to envisage at this stage, but we have not yet taken a final decision on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share your concerns about the volatility of the commodity derivatives markets; I am currently working on that very issue of volatility and, as I told Parliament, on controlling all risks of speculation and hyper-speculation, controlling what I consider to be scandalous transactions in the area of agricultural commodities. Here too we must strive for general transparency in these markets and establish tools to combat their excessive volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission wants to find a solution to the problems observed recently in the derivatives markets, particularly in respect of sovereign debt. Ladies and gentlemen, today I also began a consultation on short selling, which also covers sovereign credit default swaps (CDS). We will also present a legislative proposal in September.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I sincerely believe and am happy to tell you personally that the Langen report demonstrates the necessary level of commitment to these extremely serious issues in order to help define and implement a strategy for the OTC derivatives market, so that it may become more secure, more transparent and more efficient. Moreover, in many respects, this report represents for our governments and for the Commission a very useful and very important incentive, and for that I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to say that this is a report on a subject that is going to completely revolutionise the relationship between people and things, and between things and things in the next 10 or 15 years: a new application of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to applaud the communication drawn up by the Commission and its timely presentation, because it is about the fact that we can foresee some of the consequences of this new application, which have many benefits. They could improve many aspects of our lives and open up opportunities for new businesses and improvements in production.</p>
<p class="contents">They do, however, obviously have risks. With regard to the report, on which I worked with the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups, whom I thank for their work, our intention was for users to have all the security and privacy that they want when using these new technologies. We have been looking at whether the legal framework covered all the possibilities opened up by these new applications, and currently it appears to do so, but what was decided was that there should be continuous evaluation. As these applications are being incorporated into the different aspects of our lives, they need to be evaluated in order to ensure that users really have their privacy and security protected, from the point of view of health but also from the point of view of privacy and many other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this a good approach. This is only the beginning. Perhaps, aside from what the report says, Commissioner, we should think about how to inform users properly so that they really know what they are dealing with. The truth is that when we talk about the Internet of Things, not only users but the majority of Members of this House who do not deal with these issues look at us as if to say, ‘what is that?’ Is that not true?</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be interesting, aside from all the possibilities and responsibilities included in the report, and also in your Communication, for us to think about how we are going to explain to people, to the public, to users, what the Internet of Things is, what they can do with these applications and how their privacy and security are protected. I think this is the central issue for this new application: for the public to trust it and feel safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the main aims of the agenda is to bring in universal access to the Internet and combat digital exclusion. Unfortunately, in Europe there are currently very large differences in terms of Internet access. Poland comes behind many European countries – only 13% of households there have access to broadband Internet. Therefore, the plans of the digital agenda to introduce universal Internet access by 2013 are extremely important for us.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking of the Internet of Things, we must remember not to increase the differences which already exist in terms of Internet access. For there is a fear that further differences will be added to the present ones and a new wave of digital exclusion will arise in Europe. Some people, who are only just going to enter the world of the Internet, are going to fall significantly behind those who are already using new technologies, are very much at home in that world and know how to make good use of it all. Therefore, when talking about the Internet of Things, we must remember what a challenge this is for the European Commission, so that differences in access to the digital agenda do not become deeper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The danger which arises is clear: access on the one hand and protection on the other, broadband versus privacy.</p>

I am delighted about the report from Mrs Badia i Cutchet, because it points out that we need new European legislation to support the development of an additional network structure for the Internet of Things, ensuring interoperability between different systems and anticipating the increased security risks of cyberspace. However, we also need a high-quality and timely evaluation of the impact of the increasing quantity of radio waves on the health of both humans and animals, including birds and small creatures in towns. On every item of packaging, consumers should learn where the passive and active RFID tags are located, what their reading range is and what sort of data is received and transmitted. We should ensure that our citizens are able to use and live with microchips safely, which means protecting their chips from viruses and data misuse, but also enabling people to deactivate chips that are built into the things around us. We must not leave the Internet of Things to develop without regulations providing precautionary measures. This is a clear political signal and a task for the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is quite well worded in your report, and in particular your drawing of attention to the major developments that should have a profound impact on the daily lives of European citizens in the decades ahead. I was impressed by the other Members of Parliament paying their respects to Mrs Badia i Cutchet and also underlining how important it is for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It was rightly mentioned that it is also a matter of communication, for we have to get more attention to this very important issue. So congratulations for the pioneering role in pointing out the key challenges of the Internet of Things. I would like to repeat that the rapporteur did a great job in emphasising the number of important public policy issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I share her view that the European Union should ensure a regulatory and a legal framework and I recently spoke in this field of the values framework that protects the European citizen and at the same time promotes public as well as private sector investments in the Internet of Things.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Internet of Things to be developed effectively and deliver on its promise, we need on the one hand a public debate and on the other stable conditions for investment.</p>
<p class="contents">And we certainly must avoid people feeling that the Internet of Things was pushed upon them. It is not a matter of an obligation; it is a matter of getting an opportunity, a challenge, so to say, and a potential impact. It is great. We need to be conscious of the decisions that we are making and at the same time we need to give researchers and businesses a perspective for medium- to long-term investments, creating a level playing field and a set of common rules. I think that was one of those challenges that Parliament as well as the Commission is facing.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that an agenda has been set, it is time to roll up our sleeves, so to speak, and start implementing. We have started on this, for now is indeed the time for implementation and out of the 14 lines of action laid down in our communication on the Internet of Things, I am happy to report that several are already on their way.</p>
<p class="contents">A study on the environmental aspects of the radio frequency identification is going on and the institutional dialogue is well on its way. And in a longer term perspective, a first wave of eight EU-funded research projects will start this year and that will certainly create unprecedented synergies of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">And there are some other actions like governance of the Internet of Things, the right to the silence of the ships, privacy, data protection, standards and security that will require a sustained commitment of time and of collective effort.</p>
<p class="contents">And that is why I have decided to establish an expert group which will be asked to review those issues and not just to review those issues, but also others. It will be composed of representatives from civil society, industry, regulatory agencies, universities, governments. What I have in mind is that they will meet quarterly over two years and their reports on progress will of course be available to you.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is all about communication now and it is, indeed, implementing what we have promised the people. And just to give a short reaction to Members, it is quite clear that the Commission has made the statement that every European should be digital in 2013 and we give that statement the status of ‘this we believe’ or rather ‘this we will do’ and ‘this we can do’. I have the privilege to be invited to the ITRE Committee and to the Committee for Culture and it is quite clear that we must communicate that this is the list to do.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one line that is quite obvious, that every European should be digital, and that makes certain that your worry whether that could be done is put into clear wording.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of protecting people’s data, protection is an important point in our digital agenda. It is about trust and security. If you are not giving trust then you cannot expect that people will use this phenomenon, so it is a circle in which we have to deal with all those aspects and then indeed give an opportunity that is a challenging one for the European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future, the European Commission must carry out a more in-depth evaluation of this technology, particularly with regard to the impact on people’s health from radio waves and other means of activating identification technologies. The Commission will have to develop a transparent system based on the principle of respect for privacy right from the design phase, allowing the presence of means of identification and traceability to be specified explicitly, while guaranteeing consumers and delegated authorities the opportunity to verify the reliability of the data and the system’s operating method, as well as ensuring that data will be accessible to authorised users only. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title27"></a><a name="creitem27"></a>

<p class="contents">Based on a public-private model, we must prevent it from being controlled by a single entity or group of entities, and halt any attempt by state or supranational authorities to control the flow of information to the network.</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental concern in this report was the position of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in the global governance of the Internet. As it is a private institution, subject to US law, we have highlighted its unusual nature, given its delicate task, and although we advocate maintaining it because it has been effective in general terms, we propose a reform that will enable the European institutions to play a greater role in its governing bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet is, above all, an essential tool for exercising fundamental freedoms and for the public to enjoy genuine democracy. There must, therefore, be significant guarantees to protect against new forms of surveillance, control and censorship by public or private players, so that freedom of access to the Internet and the protection of privacy are real rather than ineffective. In particular, governments are asked to refrain from limiting Internet access through censorship, blocks, filtering or other means, and from engaging private entities to do these things.</p>
<p class="contents">Any restrictions deemed essential, for example those to protect minors, must be limited to what is strictly necessary in a democratic society. They need to be founded on law and to respect the principle of proportionality, as set out by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All Europeans must be given access to the Internet effectively and, above all, a particular effort must be made without discriminating in relation to those who live in rural areas, in line with the Digital Agenda adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We maintain that it is very important for Europe’s voice to be united and strong in the governance of the Internet, both in ICANN and on other international stages, especially in the Internet Governance Forum, as it is a powerful tool for dialogue between governments, civil society and the private sector. The next session of this Forum is to be held in September in Vilnius, and its importance did not go unnoticed when we were drawing up this report. We therefore strongly supported it while proposing a few corrections to the way that it operates.</p>
<p class="contents">On these stages it is very important that the European Union’s principles as expressed in Article 2 of the Treaty are defended, especially in our relations with countries whose values might be different to European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Respected colleagues, the Internet is the great sea: the ocean that must unite Europeans in freedom.</p>

Entire sectors have come into being, business models depend on the uninterrupted use of the Internet and now we are linking education to it. The Internet provides a substitute for social encounters. However, we also have a very different form of private communication, and it now has an infrastructure that resembles that of general public services. We therefore also need some sort of voice when it comes to decisions regarding the further development of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we always have to say that, firstly, the freedom of the Internet will naturally be abused and, secondly, it also has a value in itself that we must retain and we cannot allow something online that is prohibited offline. However, this self-regulation is not working in the way that we would like it to. Therefore, freedom on the one hand and data protection and privacy on the other are not opposing aims, but belong together in a single concept.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to urge the Commission to also be involved in this consultation and further development of the Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From a security perspective, self-regulation is no longer acceptable. Cyberterrorism or the one-sided influence of states such as China and its secret services are matters of great urgency. The US Government currently has influence over key decisions concerning the Internet, since the main organisation is subject to Californian laws, and that may not be advantageous for the European Union in the future. I support the Commission, which wants to reform the internal structures of the Internet management bodies towards greater transparency and responsibility. Incorporating the administration of the Internet into a UN agency would not be a good solution in my opinion, as it would offer little flexibility. We need an effective mechanism for appealing against any key decision made by the organisation to date, for example in the form of arbitration. We also need to increase democratic representation. User or consumer organisations and associations of Internet businesses do not currently have sufficient space to express their views. I trust that the European Commission will take all of this into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The digital agenda is, of course, a crucial matter, which will result in every European being able to have access to broadband Internet within the next few years. In addition, we are, indeed, dealing here with a classic question of recognition. Participation in the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers must be based on partnership. I think, therefore, that this reform should make the European Union a full partner with the ability to influence the function of ICANN.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, freedom in the Internet and fundamental rights are key principles. However, let us remember the most important things, chiefly associated with the protection of minors. The question of Internet gambling, which is being discussed in parallel, is also an important factor. There will also be many questions over what kinds of data can be filtered, taking account, of course, of fundamental rights and what the governments of Member States will want to monitor on their own. However, the most important thing is that the European Union will really be recognised in ICANN and be able to contribute, as a partner, to the principles which guide that organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent years the public policy dimension of internet governance has become more visible and more important as internet use has grown and its governance has taken on wider implications. The rapporteur Mr Sosa Wagner – and I pay tribute to him – and his colleagues are to be congratulated for addressing the relevant public policy issues in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission share many similar ideas and goals in this respect. You will have noticed that, when I presented the digital agenda for Europe to you, many of the issues raised in this report are reflected in its actions. The principle that I would like to highlight is the need to ensure that European values, as you have underlined, are enshrined in the global debate. We must ensure that the interests and rights of EU citizens and enterprises are taken into account in the international debate in managing this global resource.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be interacting with some of the global internet governance stakeholders at the next meeting of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) later this month in Brussels. Another major event this year which has already been touched upon will certainly be the Internet Governance Forum in Vilnius in September. I warmly welcome the European Parliament’s intention to participate again this year with a strong delegation. Of course I am aware that you, as the Presidency, will decide who is in that delegation but I sincerely hope that we will be privileged to have Mr Sosa Wagner and his ideas in that delegation. Your active involvement in this forum over the last four years has indeed promoted European values and I can only thank you as Members of Parliament for this, as well as for the excellent cooperation between our institutions. I hope we can continue to work in this spirit in the area of internet governance.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to underline, with reference to the remark that your rapporteur, Mr Sosa Wagner, made – and this is a very emotive question – is that we are responsible for the protection of minors from abuse over the internet and that we have to combine our efforts to be successful. This is not easy, not because we are not aware of the need to tackle this problem but because those who are involved in this process are people who will use every means they can. You can be absolutely sure of this. If you read the key action plans, you will see that they talk about safety, protection, security and trust. Key Action 6, for example, is worded already but there are a number of other key actions that are very relevant to the problems you have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more with those who were saying that the role of the EU in ICANN cannot be underestimated. We should take our responsibility and fulfil our important role. Of course with such a huge challenge as that presented by the internet there is also a downside, and we should do our utmost to tackle the problems involved in that downside. In any case we can do more together than each on his own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
