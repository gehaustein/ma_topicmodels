This legislation must be correctly implemented in the legal systems of Member States, and it must be clear, transparent and understandable to the citizens. In practice, however, things are not that simple. European law is often described as confused, imprecise, and as leaving too much open to interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">The general delays related to the transposition of law gave rise to Article 260 of the Treaty of Lisbon, a provision which enables the European Commission to punish Member States for failing to implement Union law properly or within the set time. In relation to this, it was with great interest that I listened to the idea of the ‘smart regulation’, which Mr Barroso presented in his political guidelines last year. While encouraging the Commission to put the ‘smart regulation’ agenda into effect, and taking the opportunity of the Commission’s representative being with us today, I would like to ask what is happening with this? How is the Commission acting upon this idea? I hope it was not just a trendy technocratic slogan. Something else which Mr Barroso promised was <span class="italic">ex-post</span> assessments. I agree that it is necessary to follow very closely what happens to Union legislation after it has been adopted. Is it implemented correctly, and if not, what is the reason for the delays in correct implementation? Is the new legislation something the citizens can understand? If European legislation does not have a beneficial effect on the economy, the environment and society, all of our work loses its meaning. Which explains the next question for the Commission: what is happening with <span class="italic">ex-post</span> assessments? How are they different from existing mechanisms used for monitoring the implementation of legislation? A further matter is that of the impact assessment which accompanies the proposal for every new law.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that the Commission, when proposing new legislative acts, must carry out a detailed analysis of their implementation, based on credible data.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I have looked at the problem of impact assessments from two points of view: firstly, the content, or which consequences of the proposed legislative acts the Commission should examine. I appeal, here, to the Commission to attach particular importance to exploring the social effects of its initiatives. Answers to such questions as what effect a particular legislative proposal would have on the European labour market and on employment in particular age groups and sectors are particularly important in the context of the economic crisis. I think this aspect has not, as yet, been the subject of sufficient analysis. On the other hand, I would like to address the question of the independence of impact assessments, which is directly related to the problem of better lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I highlight the need to guarantee full independence and suitable resources to the body which monitors the quality of impact assessments, and which, as you know, was established in response to Parliament’s demands. I am thinking, here, of the Impact Assessment Board, which is composed of the highest officials of the Commission and reports to the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am very cautious in my approach to the question of engaging external experts to conduct impact assessments, because Parliament is not, in fact, in a position to confirm their independence. In the report, I also address the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens. Public opinion too often associates the European Union with complicated and unnecessary bureaucracy. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to reduce these burdens by as much as 33% by 2012. However, I have heard reports that in certain cases the exemption of businesses from administrative obligations has led to a reduction in standards, for example in relation to safety at work. Therefore, I appeal to the Commission to look at the problem from a global perspective. Cuts in administrative costs must not be made at the cost of a reduction in social standards in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I also address the work of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, which is headed by Mr Stäuber. I think the work of the High Level Group to date has been very effective, and I welcome the news that its terms of reference are to be extended to 2013. I hope Parliament will be kept informed about how the group evaluates the realisation of the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address questions related to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in particular what the strengthening of contacts with national parliaments and the realisation of citizens’ initiatives will be like in practice. I hope cooperation between parliaments will extend not only to questions related to monitoring the principle of subsidiarity, but will also contribute to better transposition of European legislation. As for the citizens’ initiative, I think millions of citizens are waiting to hear Parliament’s position on this matter. I know that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is working intensively on this, and I hope the first reading of this document will take place before the end of the year. Now I am hoping for some fruitful discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She will see from my introductory remarks that the Commission fully agrees with most of it. We very much like the effort and strong emphasis the European Parliament puts on smart regulation because this is clearly the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad to announce to you today that on Tuesday the Commission took the final steps to withdraw 59 pending proposals listed in the 2010 work programmes which we will not pursue any more because we see that they are outdated or have outlived their initial purpose. This is also how we are honouring the commitment we undertook in our framework agreement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to confirm to you that the Commission will adopt a communication on smart regulation on 6 October, as well as the annual report on better lawmaking where we will be dealing in a detailed manner with subsidiarity issues. I believe that these documents will address in detail the issues raised by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg in her report, so I will just limit myself to some key points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point on which I think we all agree, and the financial crisis is clear proof of that, is that regulation has a positive and necessary role in assuring that markets deliver sustainable prosperity for all. At the same time, I totally agree with Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg that we need to be very careful how we legislate because we do not want to overburden businesses, and especially SMEs, with unnecessary administrative burdens. We are doing our utmost to reduce the administrative burden in existing legislation and also in the legislation we are preparing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to work very hard to pursue the four main activities related to smart regulation. We are going to continue with impact assessments. We are going to do our utmost to further improve quality. We are going to simplify legislation which is already on the books. We will continue our efforts to reduce administrative burdens for businesses, and we are also going to evaluate regulations which are already in place to see how efficient this legislation is.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that we have some disagreements and shall limit myself to two issues. The first relates to the independent body accountable to Parliament. We are pleased at how the impact assessments are being done within the Commission. The Commission, as you know very well, is accountable to the European Parliament, so Parliament as a legislator is the body which in the end controls the quality of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is recasting. You know we have exchanges of opinions between the Commission and Parliament reflected in the exchange of letters between our Presidents, where we see that the current situation which arose after the changes to the European Parliament Rules of Procedure raised questions about the use of the recasting technique. Ultimately, if this situation persists, the use of recasting for simplification initiatives and for amending existing legislation will no longer make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I think we have very strong agreement on other matters and our mutual goal is to legislate smartly, efficiently and in a way that is very good for our citizens and our businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that my opinion, which was prepared in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been extensively incorporated into the final version of this document. During the many years of the functioning of first the European Communities and then the European Union, we have learned that a single EU regulation for all Member States works more effectively in the world of free movement of goods, services and persons than intricate and very often extremely complicated legislation at the level of 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">New and existing legislation must not, however, create additional obstacles for the people who use it. It should regulate areas of life, but not prevent action. The basic idea is to simplify Union legislation and create a friendly regulatory environment which is intended to make it easier for citizens to function in the European regulatory jungle. However, this must under no circumstances lead to a reduction in existing standards in this area, but should, on the contrary, lead to standards being raised. This year’s report draws attention to a number of changes brought to the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon, which are going to have a significant effect on the entire process of Union legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased role of the European Parliament as well as the European legislative initiative and further reductions in administrative burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises will, in a natural way, draw the attention of EU citizens to the process itself and to its quality and effectiveness. The increased participation of Parliament in the Union legislative process carries with it, of course, greater responsibility. Therefore, the citizens will perceive Parliament as an institution which has a real influence on legislation which is created, and will, therefore, look more carefully at our work as Members of the European Parliament. Therefore, another important question is that of guaranteeing independent and comprehensive impact assessments. We in the Committee take a view of the matter which differs at this point from that of the rapporteur. However, what we do all want is to have at our disposal an objective and reliable basis which will allow us to chart our course and make decisions about future legislation. We also have to remember that good legislation is one of the guarantees of effective implementation and subsequent application of the provisions of EU law in Member States, which, unfortunately, is still a fairly serious problem throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts.</p>
<p class="contents">While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If all of those involved in European lawmaking abide by this, we will already have achieved a great deal. Ultimately, it is about the credibility of European law. The intention is to significantly improve the regulatory environment. It is a matter of greater transparency, coherence and effectiveness of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Two elements of the report are particularly important. Simplification of the law – better lawmaking – must not lead to a lowering of European standards laid down in current legislation. In this regard, better lawmaking must be viewed in close association with another initiative, that of smart or better regulation. Every legislative initiative should include proper consultation of the interested parties, in particular if it will have an effect on employment and social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an excellent impact assessment system is particularly important to me, as it is to everyone who worked on this report. We need a system that clearly indicates that the independence and credibility of the measures implemented are guaranteed. After all, we have had some very bad experiences in the past. I am thinking of the Services Directive and the one-sided assessment of the impact at that time, particularly on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Lisbon now contains a horizontal social clause. As far as I am concerned, this is also the basis for the fact that, in the impact assessment system, we pay particular attention – as already mentioned – to ensuring that a thorough consultation of the social partners is carried out with regard to the impact on employment and social matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level.</p>
<p class="contents">An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is therefore a lot of criticism too of European lawmaking, to which we must respond. This response must include essential elements, such as impact assessments that are genuinely independent and take account of all interested parties, and not just the economy, industry and the lobby groups. I consider that to be vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, and this has been the subject of particularly strong criticism, is the implementation of Community law at national level. Very many difficulties arise in precisely this phase of transposition, or perhaps lack of transposition, of European law into national law. It is therefore here, in particular, in this transposition phase that we need to make new improvements and to respond to the concerns of citizens in an effective, transparent and clear manner. The complaints of citizens provide the greatest impetus for innovation in European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Better lawmaking is a challenge of vital importance for the future of an EU that is relevant for citizens of our Member States. Much of the good lawmaking that we do in this House is, however, unfortunately negated, firstly by the large number of completely unnecessary regulations that still sit on our statute books and the administrative burden that places on the backbone of the EU economy, i.e. SMEs. I am pleased to see that the Commission has today recognised that in this House. Secondly there are the somewhat completely crazy initiatives that the Commission comes with to us from time to time, which achieve nothing other than to allow our real work to be ignored and these crazy ideas to be rightly rubbished.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving forward from the Lisbon Treaty, however, it is important that we concentrate on many of the issues that have been raised by my colleague. First of all, as the standing rapporteur on monitoring subsidiarity and proportionality, I can tell you that it is certainly of vital importance that our national parliaments play their right part in our process of lawmaking here, but without adequate interpretation facilities, that part of our job is not done to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the development on impact assessments. Consultation with all interested parties and compliance with subsidarity should also be tested. I welcome the report’s call for smart regulation to be defined. Impact assessments should be presented in committee right at the outset, so that Parliament can share its views with the Commission before any assessment is undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, my group is very supportive of the fact that we move forward on the following bases: the European Institutions must respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality; all draft legislation must include reasons for concluding that this level is the best at which we come forward with that regulation; all legislative proposals should be accompanied by an impact assessment with a greater degree of independence; the Commission should present all impact assessments to the committee right at the outset; and we must ensure that decisions are taken as closely to the citizen as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly grateful for the fact that so much attention has been given to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Unfortunately, we have to lament the fact that the intentions set out in the Treaty of Lisbon will not be remotely fulfilled by what the Commission is proposing. It is very regrettable to see that the whole section on national parliamentary scrutiny, which is all about the principle of proportionality, has been removed, and it is equally regrettable that with the Treaty of Lisbon we have not gone all the way and said that if a large majority of the parliaments wishes to stop a piece of legislation because it violates the principle of subsidiarity it should, of course, have the opportunity to do so. The only thing we have been able to produce is yellow cards and orange cards – something that in reality is completely ineffective and is, as far as the autonomy and sovereignty of national parliaments is concerned, more of a joke than a real legal instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">This is regrettable, but I think it is gratifying that we have now started this debate, that we have placed the focus on these important elements and that, in the process that is now being started by the Commission, we will hopefully also arrive at a situation where the Member States are actually shown respect and where it is not merely noted if national parliaments feel there has been a violation of the principle of subsidiarity, but that we actually stop and think that, in that case, we need to find another way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was one of the fine aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon and received a great deal of publicity. However, the time has already come for us to see whether it was nothing more than a populist sop aimed at winning greater public support for the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If you have really been honest when you said that national parliaments need to play a role in determining whether a particular act respects the principle of subsidiarity, a procedure needs to be drawn up right now, which will allow national parliaments to join forces with each other and take united action. This is why the requirement for two thirds of national parliaments to make a decision against a particular act because it fails to comply with subsidiarity means quite a sizeable majority is required. At the moment, in order to ensure that this principle can really be applied, a uniform procedure actually needs to be drawn up for all national parliaments to comply with. Only then will it actually be possible to apply this regulation. This is why I call on the Belgian Presidency, which will be hosting the COSAC conference of national parliaments, to take the necessary measures in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must, of course, be the case, as a matter of principle, that policies are pursued at regional or local level. Only there are policies really understandable to citizens, and that important instrument of direct democracy is only really possible to implement adequately at this level. That is the whole point of the principle of subsidiarity and that is precisely why the subsidiarity principle also has a requirement for the reasoned opinion. Thus, we should provide arguments based on quantitative and qualitative indicators as to why policy is pursued at EU level and not at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is currently the case – and I would like to address this point here – that this very requirement for the reasoned opinion is constantly being disregarded. It is possible in some cases to find information in the Commission’s report to indicate that these tasks have already been carried out at national level. Thus, insufficient arguments are presented to indicate why it is better for this regulation to be carried out at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to control subsidiarity that has now been introduced with the Treaty of Lisbon is, in my opinion, inadequate; the national parliaments do not have sufficient power and this control right is ultimately a sham right. I therefore call on the Commission in particular to proceed much more rigorously according to the principle of subsidiarity and, above all, to comply adequately with the requirement for the reasoned opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to make a few comments on it. In recent years, the Commission has taken a number of steps leading to an improvement in legal regulation and I am personally very much in favour of that. This is despite the fact that I see with my own eyes that it does not always work as I would wish. I sometimes have the feeling in this venerable institution that the right hemisphere sees the content of ‘better regulation’ diametrically differently from the left hemisphere. I would also like to bring up the results of the work of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, chaired by Edmund Stoiber.</p>
<p class="contents">I must disagree with the report on one issue; that is, with the call to increase the number of employees of the Impact Assessment Board. In my view, it would be better to think about how to help the Board in this matter. For example, within the framework of current capacities here in the European Parliament, we could set up a committee for the removal of bureaucratic burdens which, within the framework of its activity, would judge the impact assessment, just as it would assess the reduction in the administrative burdens of the proposed legal rules. The activity of such a committee would ease the difficult task for the Commission without this impacting upon Parliament’s operational expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to make the most of every opportunity to make recommendations for improving the quality of legislation. The points of the report which call for a more effective inclusion of SMEs in impact assessments are of particular significance. Enterprise support involves the provision of a reasonable regulatory framework and simple administration. As for impact assessment summaries, they assist Parliament in its work. EU legislation is heading in the right direction, assigning particular importance to effective cooperation between institutions and national parliaments.

I am aware of the demanding nature of this task, as the differences between the administrative and judicial systems of the various Member State create highly heterogeneous and frequently incompatible structures. However, this situation must not in any way undermine legal certainty for our citizens or interfere with their right to a fair and competent adjudication of their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of better understanding of the interdependence of European and national legal environments, the European Union must put much greater effort into ensuring that the process of creating legislation and the subsequent implementation of regulations and laws is simple, transparent and intelligible to the citizens of all countries of the European Union.</p>

The report very rightly stresses the vital importance of making simple, clear laws that EU citizens can understand. However, while appealing for this, we ourselves, here in the European Parliament, prepare reports, declarations and resolutions in a language which is very complicated and difficult for ordinary citizens to understand. Many of the documents which we prepare are written in the undecipherable language of law. Resolutions, too, in which we provide information to third countries about our values and talk about human rights violations, are written in this kind of language. Therefore, I think Parliament should join in the Clear Writing Campaign, which is being run by the Commission.

I think this is what the European Union and our Member States need. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for highlighting the importance of working with the impact assessments which are prepared for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Very positive precedents have been set by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we hope that other committees will also work in such a regular and detailed manner with our impact assessments as this committee has. We will of course try to do our best to improve the quality of impact assessments further, and to supply these together with a proposal for legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we need to study the impact of proposed amendments is very important. I was glad that was highlighted in the report. Very often, legislation is proposed and we change it with significant amendments which are often adopted in a hurried manner. It can really improve the legislation, but it can also make it much worse, and we should bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely agree with those Members who said that we need impartial assessment. This is what we are trying to do in the Commission. We are working very closely with the Stoiber Group. We have a very strong impact assessment board which is really driving a new culture forward in terms of how the Commission works internally. The language is very bland, and I can tell you that more than 30% of the proposals sent to the relevant departments are refused by the impact assessment board and sent back for further improvement with a view to increasing the quality of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards SMEs, I think we discussed two days ago how important it is to reduce the burden, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can benefit from the single market. I am very happy to report to you that this goal of reducing the administrative burden by 25% by 2012 will definitely be exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that my time is up so I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for a very high-quality report, and all the MEPs for their commitment to smarter and better legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that I had the opportunity to work on the report on better lawmaking this year, which was the first year after entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the year in which the European Council adopted the EU 2020 strategy. Both these documents are going to affect many aspects related to better lawmaking, and the report was a good opportunity to address the issues involved. In the course of preparing the report, I met many different groups and tried to listen to the opinions both of the business world and of workers’ groups, trade unions and organisations such as ETUC, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the complete consensus in the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs testifies to the fact that we have managed to find a judicious compromise between the expectations of all the political groups.

<p class="contents">The main principles guiding these Impact Assessments should be: that they act as a guide to law making, and must not replace or hinder the role of the politically accountable decision makers; and that any cost-benefit analysis should contain not only economic considerations but also social, health and environmental impacts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of having an independent Impact Assessment Board, I believe the best method would be to ensure that it contains multiple stakeholders with their interests declared, whereby conflicts of interest are avoided. I do agree with the rapporteur that that the high percentage of assessments (over 30%) that are initially rejected by the Board testifies to the need for the Commission departments to improve their quality further. The Board of course should only inform the process and not make any political judgements.

Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts and resources on making its use more widespread, remembering to give help to disabled and elderly people to make things easier for them. We regularly appeal to the European Commission to simplify and accelerate procedures for the use of additional EU instruments, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the EU Solidarity Fund. The reaction of EU institutions to natural disasters and serious economic difficulties in Member States is still too inflexible and too slow. It is high time we developed new instruments without reproducing earlier shortcomings.

<p class="contents">Those of us who have followed the process of postal liberalisation will be aware of what a long drawn-out affair it has been. Right from the outset in the late 1980s, this Parliament was keen to ensure that any liberalisation process should not adversely affect working conditions and should guarantee a universal postal service to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern technology has radically changed the way people communicate with each other, but at the end of the day citizens still like to see, on a daily basis, the postmen and postwomen who deliver our mail.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the starting point has to be that our postal services are not just about economic bottom lines, but they are also a social service that needs to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from this basic starting point that we must judge Directive 2008/6/EC, which will complete the internal market in postal services by 31 December this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this oral question from the Committee on Transport and Tourism is to remind the Commission forcibly of the safeguards put in place by Parliament in this directive in the areas of social protection and the delivery and financing of a universal service, and to remind the Member States that the obligation is on them to protect both of these areas and not, as they have done with railway liberalisation, just to ignore the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies the dilemma faced by this Parliament. Firstly, there is a suspicion that the Commission will not enforce these important aspects of Directive 2008/6/EC but will act with great zeal in enforcing the economic liberalisation side of the directive and, secondly, that Member States will move at a snail’s pace, will do nothing to protect postal workers and postal services and will fail to finance adequately the universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, there are four clear questions requiring four clear, unambiguous answers from the Commission. Those questions are the ones contained in this oral question.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not require technical Commission-speak answers or even quotes from the various treaties, etc. My committee is well-versed in the treaties. We require guarantees that what was agreed in Directive 2008/6/EC will be implemented, including the safeguarding of postal workers in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We require the guarantee of a universal service. We want to see the studies demanded in the directive on the cost of delivering that universal service or at least a date for their completion. We want the Commission to carry out a full impact assessment on the liberalisation of the postal market and on the effects that it will have across the sector, and not just in terms of the economic aspects of that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, one could ask why this oral question is being placed before Parliament at this time. Sadly, the answer lies in a suspicion – even a mistrust – that having got, after many years, full liberalisation of this sector, Member States will ignore the social and service provision articles that are contained in the directive and that the Commission will allow them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That simply cannot be allowed to happen. We as a Parliament are not prepared to have the same debacle afflict postal services that has been prevalent in the railway sector. Member States must abide by all the provisions of Directive 2008/6/EC and the Commission must be vigilant in ensuring that they do.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to do this would, in our opinion, be a dereliction of duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have often heard me state, including in this very Chamber, during my hearing on 13 January, the personal commitment that I have always made and will continue to make to the preservation and protection of public services and to the reconciliation of the internal market – for which I am one of the people responsible – with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will have the opportunity to repeat this when the Single Market Act is presented in October. It is within this context that we – that you – want to develop and forge ahead with this internal market. It is an opportunity for employment, since real importance is attached to its human and social dimension and, as far as I am concerned, to the protection of public services and services of general interest. That is why I welcome the question you are asking on behalf of your colleagues, Mr Simpson.</p>
<p class="contents">This very important project to reform postal services has been under way for more than just a few months. Work began on it a long time ago. The market will be fully opened up on 1 January 2011 in 16 Member States, which account for 95% of the EU’s postal volume. I repeat: this is a reform project that has been carefully thought out. It is a gradual reform that was announced in 1992 with the Green Paper. Moreover, this will to reform has been enshrined in no fewer than three directives, and validated by many successive democratic processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the third and most recent directive, which you know well, Mr Simpson, for many reasons, was adopted in 2008, with the support of the European Parliament and of a huge majority within the Council of Ministers. Twenty-five Member States voted for this reform, which has been carried out, therefore, in a fairly transparent way. It has not been carried out secretly, or randomly; it has been carried out because it meets a need, that of enabling this sector, which is very important in every respect – to quote some figures, it generates EUR 95 billion in turnover, and directly or indirectly affects 5 million employees – to evolve, to innovate, to move with the times and to better meet the expectations of users – of citizens and businesses alike. The completion of this internal market, provided it is structured and supported, is in my view a guarantee of innovation, of adaptation to change, and, therefore, of economic growth and of better services that are designed to meet citizens’ needs more fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Operators face obvious challenges due to our evolving social and economic practices, but we in the Union are fortunate in that we have long been preparing for the development of this postal sector by undertaking what is, I believe, a consistent, considered and gradual reform. This sector is developing fast. New technologies are radically changing the ways in which we communicate. The electronic substitution phenomenon is gaining ground and is quite simply the result of new behaviour patterns on the part of Europeans themselves. In addition to that, there are the effects of the various economic and financial crises we are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, quite frankly, who could actually think that a sudden, abrupt postponement of this process that we have carefully overseen is a desirable solution? Not the Commission, for at least three reasons. Firstly, achieving the 1992 Green Paper objectives is one important way for the European Union to come out of the crisis affecting the sector: we need efficient operators that rank among the best in the world, high-quality postal services and a sound, effective regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with these directives we have established a robust regulatory framework that relies on the involvement of competent national regulatory authorities, which are going to work together regularly and in a much more productive way. Liberalisation is taking place, therefore, in a controlled manner. In particular, these national regulators will have the task of ensuring, Mr Simpson, that the universal service obligations, to which I am very committed, are actually fulfilled properly and funded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, any hesitation at this very advanced stage of the reform would create widespread legal uncertainty, which would benefit no one. It would harm not only newcomers to these postal markets, but all other operators in the sector, too. Suspending this process would, in our view, plunge the sector into a situation where it has to simply wait and see what happens, without being able to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand all the concerns expressed on the subject of employment and working conditions. I know how important the postal service is in the context of European employment, ladies and gentlemen. May I remind you that the third directive, which offers the Member States considerable scope to reconcile liberalisation and social requirements, states that – and this is my only reference to the text, Mr Simpson – social considerations must be duly taken into account in the preparations for liberalising the postal markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, Mr Simpson, that we have a duty to ensure that all these requirements and all these conditions are fully met. In 2013, when all the EU Member States have implemented this reform, the Commission will present an official evaluation report to Parliament and to the Council. Other studies will be published before then. Moreover, in order to show how important your concerns are to me personally as Commissioner, and to President Barroso, I wish to inform you that, although I am under no obligation to do so, I intend to create a users’ dialogue group in 2011. The group of regulators is being established. In addition to and alongside that group I want to create a users’ group, so that businesses, citizen-users, trade unions, which have a very important role to play, and then Parliament, of course, can come around the same table and discuss what is happening on the ground, hear the report by the evaluators’ committee and regularly – just how regularly is still to be decided – carry out evaluations and hold dialogues in order to check that these various postal sector reforms are being implemented correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the guarantee I am giving you, and I shall personally ensure, Mr Simpson, ladies and gentlemen, that this users’ dialogue group functions properly and transparently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have managed to significantly improve the quality of postal services throughout Europe. I can still remember that, two parliamentary terms ago, I said in this Chamber that it was usual for holidaymakers to arrive home before the postcards they had sent home to their loved ones. That situation has now changed. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of cross-border postal services. We have achieved a significant improvement in the quality of postal services within the Member States. With the obligation for a universal service that is uniform throughout Europe, we have also managed to significantly improve the availability of postal services, or in areas where it was already good, we were able to maintain this level. That is also important, and it was mentioned by both the Commissioner and our committee chair.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in implementing the third directive, which for the majority of Member States specifies 1 January 2011 as the date for complete liberalisation, it is now important to safeguard this universal service on a permanent basis. I would like to emphasise what is stated in the question regarding the simultaneous requirement – and that was the <span class="italic">Conditio sine qua non</span> for the third directive – that it should not result in a deterioration in working conditions, but that existing social standards and protection mechanisms should continue to apply in the Member States beyond 1 January 2011. We will, of course, ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not only have the oral question today, but the Commission also has obligations to provide us with reports. We will read these reports very carefully, Commissioner, and if necessary we will also formulate the appropriate conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, thank you for your answer and for seeking to establish a dialogue among users. However, our group thinks that more is needed. As I am sure you know, we have always been critical of the Postal Directive. Improving the efficiency and dynamism of the sector would seem a laudable objective, but there are two essential elements that are not, to my mind, sufficiently developed or sufficiently guaranteed. These are the social aspect – working conditions – and the financing of universal service, which must be continued, at least according to the Directive. These two aspects are closely related.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the social aspect, we note that the ball has been placed in the Member States’ court but that hardly any use is being made of the opportunities for creating a level playing field between former monopolies and new players in this sphere. That is a big mistake, as competition is not taking place on the basis of innovation and innovative concepts but rather on the basis of cost cutting in the sector, where labour costs account for approximately 70% of production costs. In practice, we are seeing postmen and postwomen being replaced by people who have precarious contracts, lower wages and less security. That is not the Europe we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Universal service – the obligation to guarantee a home delivery every working day, including in sparsely populated areas – has up to now been financed by the monopoly. In other words, large customers have been contributing towards the service to ordinary citizens. In practice, this will now have to be replaced by State aid, and what is more in a very difficult budgetary context in the next few years, and there is reason to fear this coming under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to ask you the following questions. Do you agree with me that one of the most important objectives of the Directive, namely bringing about greater social and territorial cohesion, will be hard to achieve in this context? Secondly, you refer to a 2013 report, but could you not undertake in the shorter term a detailed analysis of Member States’ transposition of the Directive, addressing in particular the two aspects I cited: the social aspect and universal service? Finally, in addition, how does the Commission intend to strengthen the social dialogue in the sector at European level and take initiatives to arrive at a level playing field in the social sphere for all the workers in the sector? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know very well, we are experiencing demographic change in Europe. In future, there will be fewer people living in many areas than there are now. Nevertheless, we want all citizens to be provided with the services that they require and that they need in order to be able to have their say. This includes – very importantly – the postal service, which is to be guaranteed by means of a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the question of how we can ensure the provision of the service in remote rural areas with little money in the coffer, and at affordable prices. We also need people to deliver this post who are paid a reasonable wage for doing so. That is not a simple task for the Member States. However, we have decided that that is what we want and you, Commissioner, have indicated that a large majority of the Member States have also agreed to it. We now also need to make it possible for users to complain. I can see a problem with this. It has not yet been mentioned. However, the directive states that if something goes wrong, citizens should have a body they can complain to. It is not so easy, either, to maintain the appropriate infrastructure in this regard, particularly where there are not many people.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, you said that you are still new to this office and that you will at least take everything into account. I believe you. However, you have to understand that we are extremely sceptical, particularly in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Mr Simpson said that the same thing happened in the case of the railway package – the previous Commission was responsible for monitoring its implementation – practically nothing was implemented and nothing happened. In other areas, too, things have not always proceeded in the way we would have liked them to. I know that, because I was also previously in politics in Germany. Decisions are made which are extremely good and which everyone is agreed on, and then no one thinks to check to see whether it is implemented and whether it is implemented quickly in the interests of the people of Europe and in the interests of workers. That is what we want from you. Therefore, show us that we can trust you. We will be very pleased if that turns out to be justified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor do I dispute the fact that it is important to monitor their application. However, I do think that it is just as democratic and transparent to actually evaluate, at some point, the effects of a directive and the effects of its application. I do think there are probably slight differences between the Member States, but I do not believe we can talk about improving the postal service or making it more accessible to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about a reasoned and supportive attitude. I think it is reasonable to state that we are witnessing a concentration of private operators and hence a kind of private oligopoly rather than the dismantling of a public monopoly and the introduction of competition, as had been planned. I am not sure this was the intended outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">You talked about supporting a process. What regulatory practices are being applied? I am pleased that there is a group of regulators, but I would like to have a clear understanding of what constitutes good regulatory practice, since there are many flaws in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of European employment, I would join my fellow Member, Mr El Khadraoui, in stressing that the new jobs that are being created are very much insecure jobs, and that job losses are, instead, the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you are setting up a round table so that all the parties involved can engage in dialogue. If we want, as you do, to reconcile the internal market with the citizens, then opening up the postal service is really a textbook exercise in order to demonstrate that this is possible. However, this requires, firstly, a case-by-case evaluation of the results and the effects seen on the ground today. These are not the objectives that you set – or that others set. It is about time we evaluated the situation before we forge ahead and actually create an even bigger gap between European citizens and their postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Barnier, as you mentioned a moment ago, you stated when you assumed office that you would give the internal market a more social dimension. In his report, Professor Monti also put strong emphasis on this, and that is to be welcomed. What is the situation in reality, though? Yesterday, during the demonstration by hundreds of postmen and postwomen outside this building, a Dutch postwoman told me that she was already 55 years old, had been working for the postal service for only 20 years and was therefore assuming that she would be one of the first to be laid off by TNT Post next year. She is not alone. TNT Post in the Netherlands is laying off all its postmen and postwomen, purely and simply because it is now having to contend with competitors – from its own subsidiary, mark you – employing temporary ‘flexible’ workers to deliver the post for much lower pay. We are talking about 15 000 redundancies of professional postmen and postwomen who are reliable and can be trusted with our post and who, in many cases, have been doing the job for decades. Commissioner, why have you never had a study carried out into the social impact of the liberalisation of the postal market; or, rather, why are you keeping from the European Parliament the study that you have already financed, which can be found on the Internet at pique.at? The liberalisation will have dramatic consequences for everyone sending or receiving post. In the Netherlands, we are seeing several companies delivering post a couple of times a day or in the middle of the night and on other days not at all, the closure of post offices, more or less all of them, and the latest idea to be developed within your services, among that group of regulators that you mentioned but did not consult Parliament on, namely to introduce extra-high tariffs for people living on islands or in mountainous regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, can you send us a full study of all the consequences of the liberalisation for postmen and postwomen and for the service as such at long last, and can you present a proposal without delay to postpone the date for commencement of the liberalisation – a moratorium, that is – until we are in possession of these data? That would give the internal market a social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a sovereign nation, our post offices were run by the Royal Mail and linked with national savings, licensing, welfare and pension collection, to name a few.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1975, we had 25 000 post offices. Now there are fewer than 12 000 despite a population boom. After being forced to sell off their profit-making arm, post offices could not stay open without government support. Thousands shut, stripping communities of access to vital services.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU postal reform says that good quality postal services should be available throughout the Union. That is exactly what we had in Britain. As a consolidated enterprise, the service was efficient, prices were managed and everyone had access to it. Now the sector has been broken up, along with people’s faith in it. It is a disgrace to strip Britain of an efficient public service merely to satisfy competition law. Do you wish to privatise our NHS as well next? The UK must be allowed to fully opt out of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This liberalisation process is yet to show that it can fulfil the objectives of better availability and better quality at affordable prices. In the past, traditional postal undertakings also provided good quality at good prices. However, we also have to recognise the fact that traditional postal service providers have undergone modernisation, which, through major restructuring, has enabled them to increase their efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is extremely important for various points to be taken into account. It is vital, for example, that labour law continues to be respected, in other words working conditions and wages. This can only be controlled by means of collective agreements. That is the only way to prevent social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The universal service has been mentioned many times already: the delivery of letters and packages throughout the whole of Europe. I also expect the Commission to carry out a study on the universal service. Furthermore, every country must fulfil its obligation to set up an independent regulatory authority. In addition to the regulatory requirements, this authority must also monitor the working conditions of the staff and deal with customer complaints. In order to make this possible, such an authority must be provided with the necessary staff.</p>
<p class="contents">As electronic mail and purchasing and selling via the Internet are becoming more and more widespread and banks, insurance and advertising are all making use of the postal infrastructure, this must be strengthened in the short term. I expect the Commission to provide an impact assessment that also takes account of social aspects. I also congratulate the Commission on the establishment of the users’ dialogue group for trade unions, clients and operators, which was announced by Mr Barnier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it is vital in the postal services sector that Member States ensure the collection, sorting, transport and delivery of mail to all European citizens, regardless of where they live, once a day, at least five days a week, at the same price across the whole Member State, in keeping with the obligation to provide a universal service.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the need, even during this crisis period, for Member States to continue to keep postal networks operating efficiently, with a sufficient number of access points, including in rural and sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the completion of the internal market of Community postal services stipulates the obligation for Member States to define their own methods for funding the universal service, providing them with sufficient flexibility. This funding determines the quality of the postal service, the provision of decent working conditions for postal service workers and guarantees concerning jobs and employees’ training and incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is absolutely essential for the Commission to present to us by the end of this year a study on the impact of postal services liberalisation in states which have completely opened up to competition in this sector.</p>

Many people living in rural areas – many of whom I represent – and many employed in the services in Ireland and in Europe have real, genuine concerns. Postmen and postwomen play a vital role in Irish life. I should like to take this opportunity to thank them and pay tribute to them for the role they play, often going beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal service, as we all know, is more than an economic sector. It is an integral part of our social fabric in rural areas, particularly in my own country, as 40% of our population live in those rural areas. Postal workers are a great source of social contact for many elderly people and those living in isolated communities. It is therefore vitally important that the Commission ensures that the universal service obligation contained in this legislation is fully respected. I take note of the comment by the Commissioner in relation to the obligation of national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must guarantee that mail will be collected from and delivered to customers everywhere throughout the Union, including the most rural areas, five days a week in accordance with the legislation. I am pleased to hear the comment from the Commissioner on the users’ dialogue group which of course will involve the citizens, businesses, the unions and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a visit here from a delegation of European postal workers some time ago. I believe that we have an obligation to represent them and, more importantly, to represent the citizens and ensure that they have the universal service which they had many years ago, long before the economic developments in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, the feedback that we MEPs receive indicates a worsening of the situation. We are already seeing a thinning-out of the postal services in rural areas. Access to postal services in rural areas is no longer guaranteed, particularly in areas of human settlement that are difficult to get to.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have additional jobs, they are not full-time jobs. It is not possible to earn a living wage from them, and they can at best merely constitute an additional income for a family. However, if the only user of postal services we consider is the advertising industry then, of course, success has already been recorded, because there is no doubt that this industry has improved its business foundation. The universal service that is in fact intended to guarantee a basic service, is now to be paid for by the Member States, which on the other hand are under enormous pressure because there is no more budgetary leeway to be able to guarantee the provision of this service in rural areas by means of subsidies. Commissioner, in this case the indirect consequences in this area have been given far too little consideration in the impact assessment and this will lead to a deterioration of the situation for consumers and for postal service workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued.

The directive on the completion of the internal market in postal services is such a decision. We must make every effort for the directive to be implemented correctly and in time in all Member States. Mr Barnier’s answer shows clearly that he is going to work on this in close cooperation with the Member States. I very much welcome the Commission’s decision to appoint a European Regulators Group for Postal Services, which will be composed of the national regulatory authorities in the field. I am sure this will help consolidate postal services. Opening the postal markets of Member States to independent operators is another extremely important topic, and I note with optimism all the Commission’s specific measures, about which we have also heard, here. These measures are intended to enable independent operators to operate freely in each Member State. I am very pleased with the plans concerning permanent monitoring of implementation of the directive. There is one other matter: a European identity requires distinct symbols. These symbols are the common currency, flag and anthem, but, similarly, another symbol of European identity would be zero-rated roaming in the European Union and a common postage stamp. Would it not be worthwhile to consider such measures? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, in a large but sparsely populated country like Finland, there is a danger that competition will only be of interest in the most densely populated urban areas, where they can derive an economic benefit. On the other hand, the costs of delivering the mail in the unprofitable sparsely populated areas will have to be met by society.</p>
<p class="contents">Delivery costs in sparsely populated areas are on average four times higher than in built­up areas. In extreme cases the difference might be anything up to 10 times more. Even so, in Finland too some postal services have now been opened up to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive attempts to safeguard the standard of services by means of obligations imposed on the holder of a universal service obligation. I would like to hear the Commissioner’s view regarding how competition can be genuine and on an equal footing if the demands concerning the quality and standard of service placed on the holder of the USO are significantly more stringent than those placed on the competition. How are the costs incurred in the provision of the universal service to be met?</p>
<p class="contents">The directive proposes funding options, of which the simplest is to finance losses out of taxes. This, however, will probably not be seen as a sensible move, given the current state of public finances. The situation in Finland threatens to become nothing less than absurd. The holder of the USO there is a profitable state­owned company, whose annual profits of roughly EUR 100 million would be converted into state budgetary expenditure representing more or less the same amount, so that a few companies would be able to make a profit from the lucrative markets in the cities and towns. This could be very difficult to explain away to the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether it will be possible within the framework of this directive to legislate nationally on, for example, the charge on delivering a postal service, payable by all operators in the sector in order to guarantee services impartially and in unprofitable areas too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They play an important role in competitiveness and in the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. Therefore, it is not acceptable that those who live in rural areas should not have access to services of the same quality that other people have. The most disadvantaged or isolated populations have the right to quality postal services. There has been a decrease in service access points in rural areas, and a decrease in the quality of service in Portugal and in other Member States. The quality of these services must be improved or maintained, but it should never diminish.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also prevent the application of European legislation from leading to negative impacts on the working conditions and salaries of postal workers. We cannot accept that those competing for service providers intend to eat only meat, leaving just the bones for everyone else. By way of explanation, I refer, for example, to those who only intend to provide services in locations where distribution is profitable, meaning in areas with larger population density.</p>

<p class="contents">From this point of view, the opening-up of the postal market represents a real challenge for this sector, at a time when technological developments and the economic crisis have weakened those companies that have historically transported postal items.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of my fellow Members, I am very attached to economic and social cohesion, and to territorial cohesion, of which these postal services ultimately form part. As Vice-Chair of the postal services intergroup, I am conscious of the fears that exist with regard to the future of services of general economic interest: indeed, around 100 postal workers demonstrated yesterday in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is crucial to ensure that the postal market is not opened up at the expense of working conditions and quality of service. The aim of the 2008 directive is to guarantee a quality service at competitive prices and to create jobs. To achieve this aim, the law must be scrupulously applied, in particular with regard to universal service obligations. Furthermore, postal service providers must evolve by diversifying their activities and, at the same time, their sources of income.</p>

The second is evaluating and monitoring the social impact and the quality of the jobs, as competition cannot be based on social dumping, therefore we urge Mr Barnier to prove to us that the Directive has had the effects required by Parliament. The final condition is users’ rights, which are not the basic rights but the rights that we promised them for the new era: information on access points, on the capacity of new postal services, rights of complaint…</p>

<p class="contents">I have heard the Commissioner’s response and, in some respects, I am gratified at what I have heard, but there is deep concern in this Parliament that, with the liberalisation of the postal services, social conditions and workers’ conditions, as well as the service conditions that are contained in the universal service, will be diluted on the altar of liberalisation and privatisation on some issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think it is relevant that we make that point to him and I hope he will come back on that in his response.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wanted to raise is in response to the spokesman from the EFD Group with regard to the United Kingdom and the fact that he was blaming the closure of sub-post offices in the United Kingdom on this liberalisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to nail that lie very strongly. The closure of sub-post offices in the United Kingdom was a decision of the United Kingdom. It was a decision that came about because the UK Government reduced its subsidy to sub-post offices and it changed its payments of benefits into a direct payments method. That was one of the major reasons why, along with Royal Mail cutbacks, sub-post offices closed in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the idea of a UK opt-out is one of the most hilarious things I have ever heard in my life as far as postal services are concerned. Why? The most Hezbollah, pro-liberal, ‘let’s get on with it quicker than any other government’ government in Europe on liberalisation was the United Kingdom’s own government, from Thatcher to Major to Blair...</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is very important, and I am grateful to you, Mr Simpson, for having initiated it.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make two or three points before responding in slightly more depth.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as I said earlier and as everyone ought objectively to recognise, this reform, this controlled liberalisation of postal services, has not been carried out in a secretive, hurried or random fashion; it has been carried out in accordance with legitimate democratic processes and with the support of all the governments. Many of you have played a very important part in this: Mr Simpson, you are one of those people, Mr Ferber is another, and I could mention many other names besides.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where we are today. This is a gradual reform. As my services pointed out to me, there have been around 20 sectoral studies. Mr de Jong, there has been no hastiness or secretiveness. Mr Tarabella, there has been no rushing ahead regardless, either. Things are being done gradually and in stages. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that I know what is written in the Treaties and in the texts. Mrs Auconie mentioned a very important term: territorial cohesion. I fought as one of the authors of the old constitution and of the new Treaty of Lisbon – at that time I was European Commissioner for Institutional Reform – to have the words ‘territorial cohesion’ included in the treaty. It was not easy. These are words that mean something, just as, in the Treaty of Lisbon, there are new words on security and the protection of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">These are words to which I attach importance, over and above my personal beliefs, which I would like to outline in one sentence: I do not believe that Europe can be summed up as a large free trade area. Europe is not just the internal market. It is a common area of economic, social and human life. Indeed, I returned to the European Commission with that firm belief. It will underpin the work that I do throughout the five years in which I have the honour of being in this role. That is what is in the treaty. I have not forgotten it, and, if need be, I will remind all those who have forgotten it.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there are the texts of these directives, ladies and gentlemen. Frankly, I do not believe – I have said this to Mrs Wils and to others – that a moratorium or a sudden suspension of this process would help matters. From my point of view, it would create uncertainty, which would harm businesses and users, and, all things considered, it would be irresponsible. Yet, having said that, having thus confirmed that the process will get under way, we have a duty to check that it gets under way properly and in accordance with what is written in the texts of the directives and in the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bach and Mrs Auconie mentioned the universal postal service; there are some important words in the texts that are designed to strengthen the provision of the universal service. There are many mechanisms that safeguard this service provision, and we must verify that they are used; this applies to the compensation fund, to designations in the field of public contracts and to other instruments besides. These are words that I have not forgotten, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of working conditions is also laid down as an essential requirement that must be taken into account when authorising or approving postal operators. As regards social protection – Mr de Jong, Mrs Durant and Mrs Serracchiani raised this issue – it is clearly stated in the third Postal Directive that the Member States have access to instruments in labour law to prevent any possible social dumping, and it is the responsibility of those Member States to respect the principle of subsidiarity and find the best way of guaranteeing this correct level of employment and social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I could cite countless other examples of phrases and words that are all requirements for the Member States, for businesses and for the Commission, under the supervision of your Parliament and of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about an issue that affects me personally, because for 20 years I was the elected representative of a rural, and indeed very mountainous, region, and we know how important public services are for the most isolated and the weakest people who live in such regions. Mr Gallagher raised this issue, as did Mr Fernandes, Mrs Auconie and Mrs Harkin just now. On the subject of rural areas, I would point out that, where the Member States fail to meet certain minimum requirements, the Commission will use all the instruments at its disposal to ensure that they provide these basic postal services, particularly in rural areas, in pursuance of this territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that we need to make progress, without rushing ahead regardless, but we do have to make sure that the provisions in the texts, in the treaty, are respected. That is why, Mr President, the evaluation, study, report and, where necessary, correction, stages must be put to good use. Mr El Khadraoui, Mrs Ticău and Mrs Wils mentioned the first studies. I can confirm that we are going to undertake a first study this year – at the end of this year, Mr El Khadraoui – which will provide all the parties involved with an analysis of the recent developments in the postal markets and which will also cover the most recent employment trends.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not stop there: there is the official report that we are due to present to Parliament and to the Council in 2013, when the entire directive will be implemented by all the Member States. Then, there is this users’ dialogue group, in which you will participate, along with trade unions, businesses and users themselves. The group will hear the group of regulators and examine the impact assessments provided by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude – and here I am addressing Mrs Thun Und Hohenstein, Mrs Durant and others – I am as committed as you are to ensuring that these directives are implemented correctly, without citizens and users being penalised. I will be as committed as you are to ensuring that the impact assessments are objective, accurate and honest. Moreover, since I am talking about sincerity, I shall repeat what Mr Simpson said: ‘We have to be fair with Europe.’ That is why these studies and the publicity that we will generate in their regard, the debates that we will create around these studies – especially within this users’ dialogue group – are important. I shall undertake to ensure that we are fair with the European Union and with the decisions that we have taken together.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about jobs in the postal services, when we talk about the quality of distribution, when we talk about territorial cohesion, when we talk about social protection, what impact do European decisions have? What impact do the decisions taken by businesses have? What impact do the policy decisions of governments have? We must say who is responsible for what and not hold the European Union responsible for everything that happens on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also why I want to see this debate and evaluation work through to the end, and it is why, Mrs Durant, ladies and gentlemen, I personally will oversee the creation of the users’ dialogue group. I will do so in order to demonstrate the Commission’s sincerity and sense of purpose in this sphere, which is at the heart of this internal market, as an area of common economic and social life, to which I am committed and for which I am one of the people responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However much this Directive will create additional competition in towns and cities, there is no doubt that it will seriously degrade the service provided in rural areas. 40% of the people of Ireland are rural dwellers and it is essential that a postal service is provided for those of them living in remote areas. Postal services in such areas are often unprofitable.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission ensure that essential services for small, remote communities are not discontinued and that mail will continue to be collected and delivered in remote areas, in accordance with the universal service obligation? Given that business to business deliveries and postal services in towns and cities are the most profitable, what can be done to ensure that new bodies do not neglect customers and services in remote or non-profitable areas? This Directive could have a significant social impact on certain communities and postal workers. These issues must be addressed before the Directive is implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is the world’s leading region, which has now been acting according to defined principles for over 50 years. We are strong, because we have been united and we have shown solidarity. The larger Member States of the Union have respected the interests of the smaller states, and the economically more powerful states have supported the economically weaker states. Nor must we resile from these principles going forward. France’s intention to sell Mistral warships to the Russian Federation, which two years ago attacked Georgia, a partner state of the European State and of NATO, has aroused indignation among the population of several Member States. I do not wish to question France’s right to do such a deal. Nevertheless, I call upon France to abide by those EU and NATO principles that it has observed in the past, and, I am convinced, will also observe in the future. This deal is causing concern to France’s NATO and EU partners, which have always observed the principles of mutual solidarity. In the short term, this deal may well be financially advantageous, but in the long term it could reduce European security and worsen relations between Member States, thereby making us weaker. A partner’s point of view must not be ignored, especially on so important a question as the military security of EU Member States. We must not allow other countries to weaken our unity with deals of this sort. Let us not forget that our closest friends and allies are not to be found in the East, but within the Union. Let us continue to abide by the principles by which we have abided to date. If we remain united, we shall remain strong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I draw attention to this situation because we have been given, in this way, the ability to refine certain solutions and mechanisms which are in use in the other Member States. It should be pointed out that letters up to 50 grams in weight – and a great many such letters are sent by post – will be completely deregulated, although they are often letters of an official or judicial nature, which are sent as part of responsibilities entrusted to the state. The question arises, therefore, as to how the Commission intends to prevail upon Member States so that as part of the liberalisation they make it possible for services which are so important to be offered by different operators while at the same time maintaining stability and security for the state and its citizens. Considerable fears are also aroused by the very mention of the matter of adequate social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Enterprises which operate postal services are usually huge firms with considerable human resources. Will, therefore, an aggressive pricing policy and the cost-cutting policy that will go with it not result in a definite reduction in staff numbers? Meanwhile, from the point of view just of the quality of the services, the question arises as to whether the price factor will not bring about a reduction in standards. The way postal services are operated also depends on the places where mail can be sent and collected, how many there are of these facilities and their accessibility. In the case of large metropolitan areas, I am not worried. However, small towns, and rural areas in particular, may be almost completely deprived of access to postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The opening up of European markets must not go hand in hand with the abolition of social protection rights. We reject the competition between the social systems of the Member States.

<p class="contents">Mr Angelo Vassallo, aged 57, mayor of Pollica in the Campania region of Italy, was murdered last Sunday night by the Camorra on his way home. He was better known as the ‘environmental mayor’ for his great work to improve the natural environment in his region.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vassallo always fought against the infiltration of organised crime in his municipality. He had a fantastic human touch in his relations with his citizens. We must not underestimate the role of organised crime in some of our Member States.

However, sound legislation is also key to the functioning of the European Union. Simplification of the European lawmaking process should therefore be one of the fundamental concerns of the European institutions. One very important aspect of this is the reduction of the administrative burden on our enterprises. This will release a new impetus for economic development and innovation. However, Europe is not always to be found where it is heralded to be, at least that is the experience I have had in my country. The Commission must take great care to ensure that the Member States enact regulations that do not go beyond European requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on ‘better lawmaking’ comes from the same institutions that have turned this part of the world into the most over-regulated and least competitive bloc on the planet, that have brought us the bureaucratic nightmare of the common agricultural policy, the ecological calamity of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me try and be constructive. Here is an idea for better lawmaking: let us try not to be declamatory when we make legislation. Let us try not to use the statutes of this House as a way of showing that we are nice people, that we care about unemployment, that we care about the Roma or longer working hours or whatever it is. Heavy-handed intervention by the state is not usually the best way to solve problems. We are far better off allowing decisions to be taken as closely as possible to the people that they affect.</p>
<p class="contents">So my modest proposal for better lawmaking is that we close down this Parliament for the next six months on an experimental basis, we do not pass any legislation at all, and we see whether our constituents complain about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In singling out the Roma community in France for victimisation and expulsion, French President Sarkozy and his government have displayed the most disgusting cynicism. The crude use of a minority community of oppressed people to divert attention from the disastrous economic and social policies is what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sarkozy’s policies have resulted in mass unemployment in France and marginalisation of many working class communities. Mr Sarkozy’s government is now systematically attacking the living standards of French workers and is attacking the pension rights of the French people. Mr Sarkozy and his government are the agents of the French bourgeoisie and international big business and are desperately trying to use a vulnerable community as a scapegoat to divert attention from their huge unpopularity.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute the tens of thousands of French people who demonstrated against this policy last Saturday, and appeal to French workers to exercise their tremendous tradition of solidarity – with all minority communities and working people standing together in defence of human and civil rights and a better future – and not to be conned by this cynical exercise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, we do not think there is anything to be investigated in relation to Denmark’s or Germany’s deportations. Denmark acted by the book, and if Germany cannot send home refugees from a war that is over, the concept of refugee status will be lost and we will then have a completely new legal status in the world. I have to say that the Danish Liberal Party’s fight against the unjustified criticism of Denmark and Germany has been an uncomfortably lonely one. Neither the Social Democrats nor the Socialist People’s Party supported us. No, they would rather have their country and neighbouring country tarnished by controversy for which there is no documentable justification. I honestly think that it is embarrassing.

It is far more important to teach the Roma that maintaining a standard of living requires putting much more effort into getting the best possible education and holding down a permanent job.

It is quite true that we must see things in such a way that we do not implement policy as a tool, but, because the European Union is a community of values, that we show that we are really committed to the notion that we should take responsibility for our most vulnerable population groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that at present there are poor levels of social participation among the Roma population in many European countries, and that is why resolving this problem is a challenge that Europeans, the citizens of the European Union, share.

<p class="contents">With this motion for a resolution, I believe Mr Sarkozy and Mr Hortefeux, the French Minister for Home Affairs – who, nevertheless, were once Members of this Parliament – are today reaping what they have sown. They supported the opening of our borders; they concluded those treaties; they sometimes even wrote or promoted them; and they must certainly realise today that the fragile barriers that were erected – the temporary solutions that only allowed the Roma to come and settle in France after 2013 – well, they have all gone by the board.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what I find most disagreeable in our fellow Members’ attitudes is that, on the pretext of fighting discrimination, there is in fact systematic discrimination – or stigmatisation, to use their expression – of the indigenous majority populations. It is all very well to defend minorities, but do you not believe that sometimes problems may arise – cultural, behavioural or other kinds of problems – in the conduct of these minorities that in fact prevent their integration?

A Member State does indeed have the right and the obligation to enforce the rules of a State governed by the rule of law and to take action against illegal immigration and the attendant nuisance. In any case, an important key to solving the problems lies with the Roma communities themselves. I should like to mention a memorandum from former Dutch Minister for Housing, Communities and Integration Van der Laan, a socialist, which states among other things that, among Roma, crime is disproportionately high, school absenteeism is sky-high, and children are being abused for begging and criminal activities. With that position, according to socialist Van der Laan, the Roma are excluding themselves from Dutch society. There is work to be done, therefore. Mr President, I know it is not popular to say this here in Parliament, but Roma, like all other people, have not only rights but also obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel – and we already sounded this alarm at the time of enlargement – that these countries have not yet adopted strict control policies for the issue of identity cards and recognition of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the Commission and Parliament aware that in these countries certificates can be obtained with great ease from non-European countries enabling, thanks to the freedom of movement, illegal entry into the Schengen area? We must pay close attention to this matter, and it is completely irresponsible not to have done so, and to be pressing for the enlargement of the Schengen area, contrary to common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to voice my hope that, when we next meet, at least one of the do-gooder MEPs who are so supportive of the Roma will report that he or she has taken in – they can afford this on an MEP’s salary – a nice Roma family, and are feeding a few extra mouths.

Our inability to solve the problems of the Roma community can be summed up in one sentence: We know what we do not want but we do not know what we want. We do not want anyone to be punished for the offences of another only because they both belong to the same ethnic group. However, we also do not want some people to think that the law does not apply to them. We do not want to force anybody to give up their culture, but we also do not want to tolerate violations of the fundamental principles of coexistence in the name of ethnic identity. The French Government knows what it does not want. As long as it has not broken the law, there are no grounds for reproach. If it has broken the law, the courts must decide on the matter. One brief comment on the meeting this week in Paris: I would be delighted if the countries that are expected to provide a positive solution to the Roma issue were among the first to be invited to such meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution concerns an essential feature of the law, which makes it very clear that no sanction can be linked to nationality. Responsibility must always be of an individual nature, and that is a foundational principle of the law. Roma people should be treated in the same way as other citizens of the Union. This means, too, that they are subject to the law, and if they break it they must bear responsibility on the same basis as others. We cannot allow a situation in which nationality is invoked as a reason for exemption from bearing responsibility for breaking the law.

In view of the unfavourable demographic changes which are troubling Europe, immediate action in this area seems essential. As well as helping elderly people to be active and guaranteeing them appropriate care, we must not forget the people who provide that care. Often they are people who have no other help, because besides caring for an older person, they also have to hold down a job. It is not easy to reconcile these two roles. I am thinking, here, of families in rural areas, who most often take it upon themselves to care for  infirm family members. The legal situation of these people should be regulated. This will encourage others to take care of older people, who want to grow old with dignity. I think we would all want that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, under the terms of Article 225 of the Treaty of Lisbon, and because I believe that it is an example of ‘better lawmaking’, I proposed, in an own-initiative report, the drawing up of a specific directive for bio-waste that was adopted by a majority in this Chamber in July: I hope that the Commission will respond to it soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I find it regrettable that, while the report repeatedly points the finger at what it calls ‘gold-plating’ of legislation by the Member States, it does not mention a highly interesting piece of information that appears in the explanatory statement. Of the thousands of legislative acts in force, 72 alone have imposed 486 information obligations, resulting in over 10 000 implementing acts in the Member States. It seems to me that this information reveals the opposite: that the roots of this evil lie in the Commission’s hyper-regulation. More fundamentally, I wonder whether there is anything other than formal respect for the principle of subsidiarity, in that the Treaties provide for areas in which the European Union has exclusive competence and which cannot be called into question at all, while in all other areas it seems that certain national parliaments are still unable to fully exercise their rights on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people, politicians and legislators in particular, do just the opposite, probably without realising it. It is for this very reason that the continued examination of legislative practice and its improvement will always be crucial to the work of the European Union. I voted in favour of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report on better lawmaking because it raises important points on how legislation might be improved. Firstly, Parliament needs to remember its own responsibility: all too often, attention-seeking on the part of EU legislators has led to a situation where a viable directive has got bogged down by detailed amendments during the parliamentary debate. According to Schopenhauer’s precept, simple, transparent legislation does not mean that it is inferior in terms of its content: complexity and casuistry are often a way to hide a lack of ideas. Secondly, I wish to raise the matter of the impact assessments of legislation. A few important legislative initiatives, such as the history of the Emissions Trading Directive, showed that there were serious flaws in the impact assessments. People have to be precise, especially in the drafting of environmental legislation: a problem solved in one place can create a new problem somewhere else. As the resolution states, the Commission must consult interested parties regularly and comprehensively to make an objective evaluation. I think that the SME test launched by the Commission in its internal guidelines is a welcome development. Thirdly, we need to realise that national authorities are often vitally important for lightening administrative burdens. I come from a country where the official machinery is so meticulous in the application of statutes that it frequently results in additional burdens. The responsibility of the Member States cannot be ignored regarding this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Better regulation in the European Union covers a range of matters, such as carrying out impact assessments, reducing administrative burdens and simplifying and codifying existing legislation. In particular, I agree with the Commission’s programme aimed at reducing the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation which has been in place since 2005 and which seeks to reduce those burdens by 25% by 2012. It is very important to reduce the costs for businesses operating in the European Union, in order to enable them to function effectively in difficult economic conditions and compete globally and to streamline public administrative procedures. We must focus on the unnecessary requirements to provide information and apply the ‘only once’ principle set out in the Small Business Act. Electronic communication constitutes an excellent tool for reducing administrative burdens. The EU institutions must actively cooperate with the Member States in order to avoid discrepancies in interpretation and the ‘gold-plating’ of legislation. According to the Commission, 32% of EU administrative burdens are the result of decisions by certain Member States, exceeding the requirements of EU legislation and of the ineffectiveness of their administrative procedures. Also, we must not forget that consultations with all the interested parties, social partners in particular, are of fundamental importance in preparing draft legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

France began collective expulsions of European citizens belonging to this minority last August. The Roma community is the largest ethnic minority in the European Union, with populations established in several Member States in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of all European Union citizens to travel and live freely anywhere in Europe is a pillar of European citizenship, as defined by the Treaties. I do not understand, therefore, the deafening silence of the European Commission. The Commission should have reacted by explaining that for expulsion by a Member State of European citizens to be legal, it must be based on reasons of public order, it must be analysed individually, and it must be proportional to the respective threat to the public order and never result in a collective penalty against an ethnic minority. We may also ask ourselves about whether the use of funds to justify ‘voluntary departures’ is not a manipulation of the freedom of citizens and an illegal way of avoiding being defined as expulsions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current debate illustrates the difficulty we still have today in tackling European issues as Europeans and not as nationals of one or other Member State. European integration means first and foremost sharing certain values, which give rise to certain freedoms, including the freedom of movement, and of certain duties, including that of respecting the conditions that come with exercising one’s right of residence. Today, we must respond to the suffering of a population in need of integration.

The European Commission has decided, in the face of general reaction, to set up a special working group to study the problem. They think that this will appease the general outcry about the policy of discrimination and will limit the decisions by the French and Italian governments to deport the Roma. The political spokesmen of capital who alternate in the governance of the Member States and jointly make decisions in the EU believe that condemning these government decisions will absolve them and the EU of responsibility for the constant and systematic discrimination against the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the policy of discrimination is in the very nature of the imperialist, transnational union of capital. The more vulnerable the social group and the greater the profit to capital, the more acute the discrimination. The Roma are increasingly coming up against the EU, its bodies and the powers that support it. Only a joint fight with the workers to overturn the society of exploitation and to fight against the EU and its supporters will bring about respect for their rights and satisfaction of their contemporary needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Expelling these people to their countries of origin is obviously not going to resolve anything. They will return as soon as they can and no one can stop them because every one of them is a European citizen, free to go where they want as long as the provisions of Directive 38/2004 are respected. My vote firstly expresses the slight reservation I have about the motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats)/European Conservatives and Reformists due to the tacit acceptance that expulsion is not excluded as a possible solution. However, I totally disagree with the joint motion for a resolution proposed by the other political groups which, influenced by the political backlash towards the Sarkozy government, attempts to make the gypsy minority a victim of a majority and not to blame for the situation which they have been happy with for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The events occurring in France and Italy must remind Europe of the presence of a minority of 10-12 million people, which is already pan-European, with major integration problems. However, hiding them behind national borders is the wrong solution. The only viable solution capable of producing long-term results is one requiring a joint European effort to integrate this minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not a supporter of rash judgments and threats but prefer the path of a thorough examination of the situation and its subsequent evaluation. Let us take the path of dialogue with the French side. Let us give the French side a chance to explain everything and only then let us draw conclusions as to whether it is a case of a violation of human rights or whether the approach to the Roma is being carried out within the confines of European law. I expect an active approach from the European Commission in the spirit of its mission as guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a mistake if for reasons of convenience a strategy of obfuscation and attempts to let the problem bubble away were to be adopted.

<p class="contents">It is not enough to shout against discrimination, perhaps exploiting real and extremely serious problems for the purposes of party-political wrangling. Naturally, we need to firmly reassert the principles of non-discrimination, of free movement and the resulting rights and obligations – as does the resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – but more important still is to undertake practical reforms to solve the problems, in order to implement fundamental human rights. Immigration is a European issue and the time has come, as called for by Mrs Weber’s resolution, to tackle it at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roma issue only partly overlaps with the issue of integration, and in any case it has specific features which must also be addressed at European level. The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples. A nomadic lifestyle may be a characteristic of a people, which must also be respected, but inclusion must come about in a spirit of solidarity, in accordance with European rules, without the individual Member States playing it by ear.

I welcome Commissioner Reding’s belated but strong response that she is convinced that the Commission will have no choice but to initiate infringement proceedings against France for breaches of the Free Movement Directive. Roma are the single most discriminated-against community in Europe.

The time has come for all of us to shoulder our responsibilities, both by refraining from any populist, discriminatory rhetoric and by conducting effective and proactive policies to facilitate the integration of the Roma people. This applies, in the first instance, to Member States of origin, which must make better use of the funds provided by the European Union, but also to host and transit countries. Thus, in order to tackle this common problem, the resolution calls for a comprehensive plan on Roma integration to be implemented at EU level.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

None of the motions for resolutions put to the vote answered the pressing question of how best to meet the needs of the Roma people. It is quite clear that the Roma community is socially and economically discriminated against in the vast majority of Member States, which have not necessarily made use of the integration methods that the Union has made available. If the Roma community has rights, which are clearly being ignored, it also goes without saying that it has duties, like all other European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the Member States, which have a duty to provide these European citizens with somewhere to live and a chance to make a living. With regard to the events for which France has been criticised, and while we are still waiting for the Commission’s decision on the illegality of the operations carried out, I condemn any mass expulsion not based on respect for European law. However, I refuse to fall into the questionable amalgamations contained in the joint motion for a resolution, comparing the events of this summer with deportations.

The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this racist and xenophobic act, which seeks to distract us from the serious social crisis we are experiencing and find scapegoats, has not received immediate repudiation from the European Commission and the Council. We harbour no illusions about the hypocritical role played by EU institutions in this entire process, especially if we remember that they are so diligent in their criticism and interference in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, however, dealing with citizens of EU Member States, they have folded their arms or made merely circumstantial statements. Where, when it comes to it, is the European Union that claims to be one of the world’s greatest defenders of human rights? No posture other than condemnation would be acceptable here. Experience shows us that when it comes to dealing with France, one of the leaders of the EU, discretion is always used.</p>

New policies are urgently needed to promote employment with rights, welfare and social progress for all.

As I already indicated in the debate on Tuesday regarding the questions addressed to the European Council and Commission, political opinions and legal assessments are two different things, and while we may find the expulsions deplorable or excessive, only the European Commission has the competence to assess the legality of the steps taken by France. In my opinion, to accuse a country of a serious infringement based on unsubstantiated information, prior to the Commission’s pending assessment and not knowing its results diminishes Parliament’s authority. However, as rapporteur for Parliament’s European Roma strategy, I felt that in the current situation it is imperative for the European Parliament to formulate the progressive recommendations made in the motion in an official resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to state that the EU and its Member States share the responsibility for Roma integration, which requires a comprehensive EU-level strategy. This should be created with the inclusion of Roma communities from grassroots levels to international NGOs, including all aspects of planning, implementation and control. We must also state that a complex development programme must be created, which targets simultaneously all related policy areas and facilitates immediate intervention in ghetto areas struggling with serious structural disadvantages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems of minorities in Europe are complicated and sensitive, and they are often exploited for narrow political ends. Political manipulation that essentially fails to tackle problems at their root but complicates the integration of minorities I find unacceptable. Proper EU financing and the cooperation of Member States in order to implement it are essential to encourage the social integration of Roma people. Several instruments that could be used to eradicate Roma exclusion, including the possibility of using the European Social Fund, are already at the EU’s disposal. They will be supplemented by the opportunity to use up to 2% of the common European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) finance for housing expenditure for socially excluded communities. That is why it is important to ensure practical action is taken for the integration of the Roma people, beginning in those Member States whose nationals they are. At the same time, of course, we must guarantee freedom of movement within the Union, and when expelling EU citizens from a Member State, every case must be considered on its merits, and the decision for expulsion must be based on the appropriate decision of a court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be remembered that Romanian citizens will only enjoy full freedom of movement in 10 countries of the EU, including France, from January 2014. Moreover, all EU citizens can be obliged to provide proof of their means of support after staying longer than three months in a country that is not their own. If they prove to be too great a burden on the social security system of the host country, measures can be decided on, under paragraphs 9 and 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. While the mass expulsion of Romanian citizens of Roma ethnicity can be questioned, people who protest violently against it should also be concerning themselves with a great deal more, and with the same intensity. They should be concerning themselves with the children whose families generally prevent them from attending school; with children and women who are used in begging; with begging adopted as a life choice; and with the rejection of work and recourse in its stead to the social security systems of third countries.

Free movement of persons is one of the EU’s fundamental principles. European citizens of Roma origin, regardless of their nationality, also have the right to move around the EU freely. They, like any European citizen, have both rights and obligations. If a person, regardless of their ethnic origin and nationality, commits offences, they will face the full force of the law.

The resolution adopted during  plenary is an ideological text rather than a concrete action plan. The resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is basically a show of hypocrisy covered up by ‘progressive’ political discourse. This resolution is attempting to make us believe that now we are all racists.</p>
<p class="contents">That is except for left-wing politicians, of course. The resolution was drafted and voted on without any proper knowledge of the Roma’s situation, either in Eastern or Western Europe. The Roma issue is not a national problem and cannot be described either in terms of racial policy. The Roma issue goes back a long way in Europe’s history and still remains unresolved. The use of clichés and the political agenda, mainly in the form of the socialists’ clash with the right-wing administration in France, will not resolve anything, apart from the left wing’s electoral objectives. I voted for the resolution from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) precisely because this document suggests measures and calls for coordination at European level. The Roma issue is not a question of racism, but of realism. If the Roma issue is dealt with according to the terms stipulated by the left, it will quickly resurface and will trigger new crises in one Member State or another. The outcome of today’s vote is regrettable and unproductive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also remind you of the enormous contribution of voluntary bodies, religious organisations and charities in this area. The Member States should be particularly vigilant with regard to guaranteeing the protection of the fundamental rights of people receiving care over a long period. The Member States should provide support, as a matter of priority, for the establishment of home palliative care units, and devise and implement advanced training systems to help raise the educational level of those working in the eldercare system. The Commission should prepare a study which will give a clearer picture of the increasing requirements for the care of older people and an estimate of the anticipated specialist provision for the period until 2020.  </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rivers have never been many here, their flow is very unstable, even in ancient times forests gave way to farmland and pastures every year destroy shrubs, trees and other greenery. The water flow in the Jordan River is already low and the water is polluted and the Dead Sea is gradually drying up. Assuring a sufficient flow of water in the river is a major technical problem, which can only be solved in a peaceful political climate. The European Union has long been active in a series of projects the chief aim of which is to support the peaceful development of the whole area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore also desirable that we support the key programme, namely the renewal of a rational water regime in the middle and lower flow of the Jordan. Because local governments face similar problems in a number of places in the Sahel and Asia, it is not only the response of the Commission that will provide a valuable inspiration for the solution of similar problems in a number of other places, but the adoption of concrete corrective measures.

<p class="contents">He is hardly the sort of person you would want to make a guest of honour, and Turkey had to back down from inviting him to the OIC Conference on Ankara last year because of the ICC indictment.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, that is exactly what Kenya’s President did recently at the ceremony to mark the promulgation of the new constitution of Kenya. Admittedly, many government ministers in Kenya’s fragile coalition, including Prime Minister Odinga, were very uneasy about Bashir’s presence, but the damage has been done and Kenya’s reputation as a regional leader, in that it is both a democracy and upholds international law, is now besmirched.</p>
<p class="contents">The ICC was established precisely so that high-ranking officials, even heads of sovereign states, could be called to answer for their alleged crimes when these became crimes against the whole of humanity, or genocide, or war crimes and therefore subject to universal jurisdiction for Rome Statute signatories.</p>
<p class="contents">Kenya’s refusal to honour its obligations as an ICC member is therefore deplorable. However, recent news that Kenya will cooperate fully with the ICC as it investigates the tragic post-election violence of three years ago is to be welcomed, even if it is long overdue and seems to be a consequence of the furore over the Bashir case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Africa played a crucial role in the establishment of the ICC and its commitment to the court’s Statute is also reinforced in Article 4 of the Constitutive Act of the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou Agreement between the EU and Kenya lays down the conditions for partnership, and in this agreement conditionality on trade and aid in terms of adhering to democratic and human rights standards are clearly spelled out.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, on 27 August, Omar al-Bashir visited Kenya as an official guest of the government, a dignitary. This happened during the period of an arrest warrant brought against al-Bashir for his alleged role in the genocide in Darfur in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">Al-Bashir can still defend his case before the ICC, but first needs to be brought to The Hague. Kenya had the obligation to arrest him while he was on its soil and failed to do so. This is a serious problem. It is a signal that the government does not play a credible role in adhering to agreements it has itself signed up to, and this should be a serious problem for the EU.</p>

The EU Member States need to be constantly reminded of this, as the fear of diplomatic problems and possible political prejudice often stands in the way of consistent action, in connection with the arrest of suspected war criminals, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In our motion for a resolution today we criticise the actions of the Kenyan Government, which invited the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, and then failed to arrest him. Arrest warrants have been issued against Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and genocide. As a result of this, Kenya has contravened international law and publicly celebrated the fact that the supposed African solidarity between governments is more important than dealing with and prosecuting such serious crimes as crimes against humanity. That is not a good sign for the millions of people in Africa who have suffered the atrocities of President al-Bashir, and also those who have experienced terrible suffering in other wars and civil wars. The victims and their families need this to be dealt with, they need justice, and they ought to see these criminals, even if they are high-ranking political or military figures, brought to account for their atrocities.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the African Union spoke out openly against the arrest of President al-Bashir is also worthy of strong criticism. It shows false solidarity to its Member States, it supports impunity for high-ranking politicians and thereby weakens the essential good governance – governance that should base its decisions on current and international law. It is also disappointing that the African Union has refused to establish a regional office of the International Criminal Court in Addis Ababa.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason for the renewed call for the Commission to place the matter of this non-cooperation and the refusal to cooperate with the International Criminal Court on the agenda of the next EU summit with the African Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Sudanese President thus enjoys total impunity in almost all African and Arab countries. Many of us, though doubtless not quite so many, wish that international justice could be the same for everybody throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We know how difficult it was to set up the International Criminal Court (ICC). We also know that there is still quite a long way to go before this court can act throughout the world. We would be more credible, however, if all our Member States, particularly France, did not vacillate so much before adapting their laws to those of international justice. We would be more credible if major countries like the United States did not place themselves beyond the reach of this international justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go so far as to say that European countries bear serious responsibilities towards Africa, and we must not give them the impression of having double standards, because we have to acknowledge that international justice seems to apply above all to African countries unless the governments of certain European countries have powerful interests there.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we in this House regret that the ICC’s decision has not been applied to Omar al-Bashir, who is responsible for so many crimes. However, we want equal justice for everybody, including on European Union soil. It is only on the basis of this condition – that of setting an example – that the European Union can be a real area of freedom and justice and we can progress step by step towards the universality of law, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am also delighted that this morning a large majority of this House condemned all discrimination against the Roma people, particularly the xenophobic comments by the President of the French Republic, who still dares to invoke the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do now, Commissioner, is to turn our words into deeds if we want our words to remain credible throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The horrors of the war and persecution of the 20th century compel us to modesty in this century, too. There is one point, however, on which I believe we can indeed speak of progress, and that is international criminal law. It all began with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), followed by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and led to the International Criminal Court. Justice is administered not by the victors in a war, as could still be said of Nuremberg, but by an independent international court. The most serious crimes can be tried there if the state in which they were committed fails, intentionally or otherwise, to prosecute them itself. This way, the world’s sense of justice can be restored after great atrocities and justice is done for the victims, and only then does reconciliation become possible. Lasting peace. This criminal court acts as a deterrent to future war criminals. Impunity is a licence to commit new violence and cannot and must not exist, particularly in the case of the immense atrocities of which Omar al-Bashir stands accused. Kenya is a signatory to the Rome Statute. <span class="italic">Pacta sunt servanda</span>, treaties must be adhered to, otherwise they are undermined, and that is why it is intolerable for al-Bashir to be able to celebrate democracy unhindered in Kenya, when such gross human rights abuses have been committed in his name in his own country Sudan. Thus let this be an appeal, like the one by Mrs Vergiat, to the countries who have yet to sign the Rome Statute, chief among whom the United States. What is Barack Obama waiting for? Strengthening the International Criminal Court will bring us closer to the world order we seek, an order that does not let war crimes go unpunished, that brings us closer to peace and that is based on human rights throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it invites and welcomes President al-Bashir, and on the other hand it is a signatory to the Rome Statute. These two facts cannot be reconciled. Kenya must decide what to do – either to pursue criminals, or to allow them to live in peace. Pretending these two alternatives can be reconciled is, quite simply, dishonest. The argument of the Kenyan authorities that the West is not one of Kenya’s neighbours and that this is why President al-Bashir was invited is not acceptable, because it does not take account of earlier formal, political and moral commitments. The authorities of Kenya, Chad and other countries which have ratified the Rome Statute should adhere to its unequivocally specified principles. I can understand that some people are in favour of leaving criminals unpunished, but I cannot understand or accept that people pretend to want to pursue criminals but do not do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The same scenario certainly awaits the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, the architect of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, who has been wanted by the International Criminal Court since March last year. What can the European Union do to help bring al-Bashir before the Court? First and foremost, it can put pressure on states which are signatories to the Rome Statute, because the Statute is the legal basis of the Court’s work. There must not be a repeat of the situation which took place on 27 August, when President al-Bashir, undisturbed by the police, came to Kenya, a country which has signed the Rome Statute, for a ceremony related to the adoption of the new Kenyan Constitution, after which he returned safely to Sudan. All diplomatic channels should be used, including the active participation of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to use the instruments which are available, such as the regular summits of the African Union and the Cotonou Agreement, finally to bring about the detention of al-Bashir, who is accused of genocide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such it should have facilitated the arrest of Omar al-Bashir, a leader – as has been said – against whom an international arrest warrant has been issued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide in Darfur.

This House must remain vigilant and call on the European Union, and Baroness Ashton in particular, to put this respect for international law and human rights before any other consideration by, of course, making it a major topic on the agenda of the forthcoming European Union-African Union summit to be held on 29-30 November in Libya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The position of the African Union from July 2009, and also of the Arab League, which are refusing to cooperate with the International Criminal Court in this matter, provides clear evidence that many representatives of these countries simply do not see in the actions of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir the kind of deeds that should be judged before the International Criminal Court. In other words, many of them consider tyranny and the crude genocide of millions of civilians as an acceptable procedure, and one which they could employ to deal with the rebellion of a population that had duly failed to appreciate their rule and therefore dared to be dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure whether it is correct for the civilised world to provide such rulers with any form of financial or material assistance. Perhaps it would be appropriate to sit down with these rulers as soon as possible and carefully explain to them that violating serious international commitments really is not compatible with the financial and material assistance they receive from us. If they fail to understand this, for whatever reason, it will then be necessary to apply the sort of measures that are applied against other barbarous regimes. It is simply not acceptable that our citizens are contributing in these difficult times to assistance for rulers who are helping to frustrate the provision of justice by the International Criminal Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation is a delicate one, and past and future events both play a part. Its neighbouring countries make a priority of good relations with Sudan, even at the expense of international law. At the same time, the millions of victims of the Darfur conflict deserve justice and relief from their suffering. Furthermore, there follows an important phase in the implementation of the peace agreement concluded in 2005: the vote in January on autonomy for Southern Sudan. Whatever the referendum results in, it will be difficult to avoid unrest. It may be possible to prevent a repeat of the disaster across Darfur with a little prudent assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I now want to seek a greater role for the EU in Sudan, given the criticism of Kenya’s decision. We must show that the EU robustly and tangibly supports the implementation of the peace agreement.

<p class="contents">The Kenyan minister of foreign affairs also mentioned the decision adopted by the African Union last year not to cooperate with the ICC, which was reiterated in July at the meeting in Kampala.

Up to 2007, the financial support amounted to at least EUR 300 million.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this financial support is only meaningful if the African Union actively cooperates to ensure peace in crisis-torn regions of Africa. It is apparent, however, that the African Union is in fact not very cooperative. At the summit in Libya in July 2009, it was decided that the Member States would not hand over the President of Sudan if he entered the territory there. There is an old saying that ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune’ – not very elegant, but there is a certain amount of truth in it. In simple terms, that means that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy needs to make it absolutely clear that the EU funds for peacemaking measures in Africa can only be provided if the African Union and the Arab League cooperate with the International Criminal Court in future, instead of undermining its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As this Parliament will know, the EU is a long-standing supporter of the International Criminal Court. Witness to this is the promotion of the universality and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC in our political dialogue with partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The revised Cotonou Agreement is another instrument which we have to promote the strengthening of peace and international justice by seeking to ensure that our ACP partners ratify the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore note with concern that, at its July Summit, the African Union called on its Members not to execute the arrest warrants against President al-Bashir. The official visit of President al-Bashir to Chad in July, and Kenya’s invitation to al-Bashir to attend the ceremony promulgating its new constitution are also worrying signals from our African partners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the EU’s view that Kenya must balance its legal and political obligations: it must abide by its obligations to the ICC as a State Party to the Rome Statute and it must respect its international law obligations, notably UN Security Council Resolution 1593.</p>
<p class="contents">As a supporter of the National Accord in Kenya, mediated by Kofi Annan, a key element of which is fighting impunity for the post-election violence, the EU will continue to encourage Kenya to cooperate with the ICC, including in our Article 8 dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the fact that Kenya has upheld its commitment to cooperate with the ICC on internal issues, as demonstrated during the visit of the ICC registrar last week. We can but hope that Kenya adopts the same behaviour as far as international issues are concerned as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In keeping with the EU’s position on the ICC, on 27 August, the spokesperson of the High Representative and Vice-President issued a statement expressing concern over Kenya’s failure to arrest al-Bashir, and the EU delegation to Kenya was instructed to undertake a démarche to convey our messages to the government. That was done yesterday. I will convey to the High Representative the wish expressed during this debate that this issue be brought up in the context of the next African Union-EU meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Omar al-Bashir has been identified by the International Criminal Court as complicit in the genocide which was committed in the province of Darfur. This is the first time the ICC has indicted a head of state who is still in office. The cruel actions of Omar al-Bashir produced thousands of victims, and many of those who survived have been forced to leave their homes and live in exile. The Government of Kenya made a deliberate decision to ignore international obligations. Not only did it host Al-Bashir at the celebrations for the promulgation of the constitution, but it did not take any steps to carry out his arrest. This testifies clearly to the fact that local interests and neighbourly solidarity have proved more important than decisions of the International Criminal Court. However, no one should be exempt from punishment, and especially not a person responsible for such serious crimes. The President of Sudan should bear the consequences of his deeds under international law, and the Kenyan authorities should have helped achieve this. The European Union must make appropriate efforts to convince the countries of the African Union of the necessity of respecting the principles of universal jurisdiction. This is not only in the interests of the authorities, but principally of the citizens of the African Union’s Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

For a long time I have followed the case of Haythan Al-Maleh with concern. Too often I have felt that not enough attention has been paid to his case. We have no time to waste: he is 80 years old, and I hear from his son, who has visited Parliament, that his father’s health is deteriorating. Mr Al-Maleh suffers from arthritis, diabetes and thyroid problems, and I understand that he is being deprived of access to medication.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Al-Maleh was arbitrarily arrested by the General Intelligence Service on 14 October 2009. He was held incommunicado and tried before the Second Military Court of Damascus, despite the fact that military tribunals should not try civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 July 2010, Mr Al-Maleh was sentenced to three years in prison on the grounds of ‘transferring false and exaggerated news that weakens national sentiment’. Colleagues, we should be aware that many countries are unfortunately using such titles for criminal charges nowadays. It is totally unacceptable. This happened under Articles 285 and 286 of the Syrian criminal code. Such charges are clearly too vague and easy to abuse. They have no place in the jurisdiction of any modern state.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious concerns also remain over the fairness of Mr Al-Maleh’s trial. My key message is that there are serious grounds to believe that Mr Al-Maleh is a victim of repression by the authorities in response to his human rights work, which is extensive and impressive. He must be released immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that Mr Al-Maleh is an excellent candidate for the Sakharov Prize. I will be taking action to see that he is one of the candidates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to violating international treaties and conventions, the imprisonment of this man, who is a human rights defender, is also contrary to the legislation of that country, which stipulates that military tribunals are not competent to judge civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision that was taken regarding this man and other Syrian prisoners held for similar reasons, the various detentions, the restrictions to freedom of movement, and the arbitrary measures implemented by the Syrian authorities are practices that go against Syria’s important role throughout the region, and they do not reflect the efforts that have been being taken in this country to improve its social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, today we are discussing yet another situation of violation of human rights. It is not possible to separate it from the many discussions we have had here this week. I would highlight two: the first is the condemnation of the sentence to death by stoning imposed on Sakineh Ashtiani. Many voices joined together and there were some results. It is not yet time to declare victory; much less is it time to fall silent. The second is that we have adopted an important resolution today against abuses committed by President Sarkozy’s government against Romanian and Bulgarian citizens. The defence of human rights has no borders, and it is not a fight that can be fought only outside our walls.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we gave a good example of how to also fight it within our own walls. The unjustifiable imprisonment of Haythan Al-Maleh united all of us here today. He is a human rights defender. Human rights defenders must be free, and this is what we demand of the Syrian authorities. We who are also human rights defenders will not abandon him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been said, he is an elderly gentleman. He is accused of crime, but under articles of the criminal code that seem to us to be greatly exaggerated. After him, above all, there are other human rights defenders, other lawyers and other doctors whom we know well, as they have come to the European Parliament and have been subsequently imprisoned. They are prisoners of conscience, and we cannot accept that from Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is always important to mention names, I would like to mention the names of Mr al-Hassani and Mr al-Abdallah, as well as Mr Labouani, who visited us here. They are almost all friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say very strongly that there are many things in Syria that I would like to see shared elsewhere. There is nothing outrageous in what I am saying. There is real freedom of conscience and religion. A real effort is being made in education and health. A real effort is being made to welcome Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. It is a country with potential, not least on the international stage, that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to President Bashar al-Assad, whom I know well, ‘President, you do not need these prisoners of conscience to be strong in your country and to figure on the international stage. You can afford the luxury of defending human rights as well.’</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, in my view, just remember the face of systematic repression when we think of Syria. It does exist, ladies and gentlemen, and we cannot deny it. There is more to Syria than that, however, and that is why we value this association agreement so much, Commissioner. We are aware that Syria has rejected it for the time being. Please keep us informed about how the negotiations progress. We – many of us, at least – would like Syria to be able to play the positive role that it would be capable of playing on the international stage and in the Middle East peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that we want the immediate and unconditional release of Mr Haythan Al-Maleh, all other human rights defenders and all other prisoners of conscience. As far as we are concerned, there can be no compromises whatsoever on matters of human rights. However, in our resolution, including in recital A and paragraph 9, we say that we want a dialogue with Syria. At the end of the day, we want the agreement with Syria as quickly as possible, but not unconditionally, as an instrument for human rights and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly recognise the fact that – as Mrs De Keyser said – there have been positive as well as negative developments in Syria. Nowhere on the Arabian Peninsula or in Mashriq are Christians and other minorities treated as well as they are in Syria. Lebanese Christians – and indeed prominent ones – tell me that they are only able to survive because Syria is holding a protective hand over them.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria is not Iran’s lackey either, Mr Tannock, but an important counterweight against the dominance of Iran. We therefore need a stable Syria, but Syria must also take steps to make that happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not give up hope of being understood, though, and let us carry on waiting for progress, more progress – I do understand that some progress is being made there – for all the Syrian citizens who aspire to more freedom, particularly freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Our motion for a resolution today concerns Mr Haythan al-Maleh in particular, a tireless defender of human rights. This lawyer was sentenced to three years in prison at the end of a parody of a trial for having – and I quote – ‘spread fallacious and exaggerated information prejudicial to national feelings’. That is what it says. Our resolution therefore demands the immediate release of Mr Haythan al-Maleh for the reasons that I have just explained and also for what has already been mentioned – his old age and the very serious health problems that he has.</p>
<p class="contents">More fundamentally, of course, we want to draw attention to human rights abuses in Syria: executions – we mention them in our resolution – arrests and restrictions on a whole series of freedoms, all that in the name of a state of emergency, which is temporary by definition, that has been going on and on there for more than 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Union to assert these demands, which have been restated by Baroness Ashton and are crucial, and above all to use them to exert pressure in talks and negotiations in connection with signing the association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are moving away from what was termed the ‘Prague Spring’ over 10 years ago, in 2000, when Bashar al-Assad had just come to power. Over a period of just a few months it offered a glimpse of a brighter future for Syrian civil society. It is now time, I think, for Syria to continue to implement all these necessary reforms if it wants to put across an image worthy of the major role that we hope and want to see it play in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The victim has had his fundamental freedoms violated and has not had other rights respected, such as the right to presumption of innocence, a fair trial and defence, including the right to choose freely his own lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, apart from all these extremely grave irregularities, the nub of this case is the charges brought against Haitham Al-Maleh, a veteran human rights activist who had already served time for his activities supporting constitutional reforms in the 1980s, when he was sentenced to a seven-year prison term.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, Haitham Al-Maleh was sentenced to three years in prison for a crime of opinion, charged with damaging the morale and feelings of the nation through criticism targeted in particular at the state of emergency which has been in force for four decades and suspends citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this severely ill octogenarian is in danger of ending his life in prison all because he exercised his legitimate right to free expression, guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has been ratified by Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the charges made contravene the right to free expression and his state of health is increasingly precarious, we too support the appeal made to the Syrian authorities to drop the charges and release Haitham Al-Maleh and the other political detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">The first steps towards normalization and democratization of the regime should be a general amnesty, stopping the harassment and punishment of human rights activists, ending the arrests of political opponents, as well as guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself, when I was in Syria, saw those people and heard what they say. In speaking of this case, I think we need to go back to Tuesday’s debate on the state of the Union, when the leader of one of the political groups said that in important matters we must not be a kind of fax machine which spits out statements about world events. We have to get over that barrier and do more than just talk – and we talk a lot in Parliament – but we would like the talk to translate into greater effectiveness in our work. I am disturbed by the situation of the well-known human rights defender Haythan Al-Maleh, who has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for defending human rights and openly expressing his opinions. He has frequently suffered repression at the hands of the authorities, and has been imprisoned, accused and persecuted. Despite this, he has never ceased his activities and continues consistently to expose the illegal activity of the authorities. He is not alone in this. Many Syrians are saying they want their country to change.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the European Parliament’s most important objectives is to be involved in the defence of human rights. This is one of those situations in which we must not be a fax machine, printing out statements. Haythan Al-Maleh is a prisoner of conscience, and is being held only because he exercised his right to express his opinion. We must not stand quietly by, because those who have elected us precisely so that we will freely express our opinions expect us to call for the same rights for others. If, today, we did not speak up for Al-Maleh, what sense would there be in our being elected, what authority would we have as MEPs, how would we be able to look our voters in the face in a few years’ time? I would like to stress that when we appeal to equality, justice, law and order and to everything about which we never stop talking in the united Europe, when we talk about friendship and about peaceful cooperation, we must not hide from such problems. These problems require great commitment from EU diplomacy, and they require the development of forms of pressure which would allow the Syrians to enjoy the kind of freedom of speech which they want and the kind which we enjoy. Let us share freedom of speech, and let us appeal to the EU institutions to be particularly effective in such matters, because the reputation of the European Union depends on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been said, he is an 80-year-old man in a frail state of health and this case must surely be judged from a humanitarian perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the purely humanitarian aspect of this case, we must take into account that Haitham Al-Maleh has been convicted by a military tribunal, following a trial where his fundamental rights have been completely flouted, and that this verdict, as we have already been reminded, contravenes international norms. Why has this happened? Simply because Haitham Al-Maleh has done what he has been doing for well over four decades, which is to speak in very serious, plain and critical terms about the freedom which is sought after in order to improve the situation for people in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Syrian authorities must look at the prospect of signing the Association Agreement with the EU as an incentive to improve the overall human rights situation.

This is the right way to make our request, because it is these authorities of the state which make the decisions. However, I would like to recall something: not long ago, towards the end of the last parliamentary term, we played host, in this Chamber, to the Grand Mufti of Syria, who spoke during a plenary sitting of how there are civil liberties in Syria and that the principles of democracy and freedom of speech are upheld. Perhaps we ought to turn to him, because he is a great authority in Syria and someone who enjoys support in society. It may be that he will be able to influence the Government and the President.

<p class="contents">Three significant cases have captured the EU’s attention recently: those of Mr Muhammad al-Hasani and Mr Haythan Al-Maleh – many have referred to them today, not least to Mr Al-Maleh – and also of Mr Ali Abdullah, a writer who was re-arrested in June after having completed his sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has taken a number of actions. These cases have been raised – including by the High Representative – with the Syrian authorities at the appropriate levels. The EU has insisted that the very fragile health condition of the 80-year old Mr Al-Maleh be taken into account on humanitarian grounds. Démarches were made in the utmost discretion to start with but, in the absence of any response from the authorities, the High Representative issued a statement on 27 July recalling Syria’s commitments under international law and urging the release of political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the lack of a positive response so far, EU actions must – and will – continue. The EU is working on different fronts in parallel to advance human rights in Syria. The EU and Member State delegations in Damascus will continue to monitor the situation and observe the trials. Mr al-Hasani and Mr Al-Maleh have filed appeals.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for human rights defenders and their families and lawyers will be pursued. At the same time, respect for human rights must remain a recurring issue in any EU dialogue with the Syrian authorities, at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Keyser asked about the status of the association agreement. Syria is still withholding its reply to the EU’s invitation to sign this agreement, which has been pending since October 2009. Syria indicates that the assessment of its political and economic impact is not yet finalised. The agreement will undeniably bring several benefits to both parties but, for the European Union, it is also the best way to establish a regular and frank political dialogue with Syria, including on human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Advancing EU assistance on human rights and democracy is another important avenue. Projects in the pipeline include modernising the judiciary and strengthening the capacity of Syrian civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 forms one of the targets of Goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals. This issue is very directly linked to the right to health, education, food, clothing, housing and work. Nonetheless, nearly one million people still do not have access to safe drinking water, more than 2 500 million do not have access to sanitation and a child dies every eight seconds from water-related sicknesses. A World Bank report says that by 2030 global demand for water will exceed supply by 40 %.</p>
<p>Does the Council think that recognising access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation as a universal human right can contribute to improving this state of affairs?</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September I 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The European Union is firmly committed to ensuring that the need for access to water and sanitation is better taken into account throughout the world. Aware of the issues at stake, particularly with regard to public health in developing countries, the EU has been fulfilling this commitment in various ways for many years, starting with the launch in 2002 of its major water initiative. The aim of the initiative is to provide a framework for establishing and financing strategic partnerships with developing countries regarding these issues, with a first partnership agreement signed the same year in Johannesburg between the EU and Africa. The Water Facility set up for the ACP countries will have a budget of EUR 500 million, which will be used in particular at local level, where it is most needed.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the European Union will support the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council on human rights issues relating to access to water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Council Resolution 7/22 of 23 March 2008 established the mandate of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This mandate is for three years and runs until 2011. Mrs de Albuquerque has, since then, been working to clarify the content of these obligations through studies and reports, and through field visits to identify good practices. The Human Rights Council has repeatedly adopted resolutions acknowledging this work. Moreover, the EU established a very close working relationship with the independent expert within the Council’s Human Rights Working Group in February 2010.</p>
<p>To celebrate World Water Day on 22 March 2010, the EU wanted to mark the importance of this issue by highlighting Member States’ human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water, which must be available, physically accessible, affordable and of acceptable quality.</p>
<p>The European Union considers that human rights obligations regarding access to safe drinking water and sanitation are closely associated with individual human rights such as the right to housing, food and health.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit that the EU is approaching the discussions under way in Geneva, and that it adopted a position in New York. A common EU position could not be reached last July on the Bolivian resolution recognising the right to water and sanitation as a basic human right. The EU is committed to ensuring that the independent expert continues her work in Geneva. The EU hopes that by clarifying the scope and characteristics of the obligations resulting from this right it might be able to reach a common position on this issue. The EU remains committed to ensuring that a consensus is reached on these issues with the entire international community, and it will continue to work along those lines with its partners.</p>
<p>Beyond these discussions, the EU continues to make a major contribution, within the scope of its development policy, to the efforts to improve access to water and sanitation in practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0382"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September I 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) As you know, the European Union reacted immediately to the emergency situation following the earthquake in Haiti on 12 January by adopting a EUR 3 million emergency aid package on the very next day following the disaster. This was followed by an aid package of EUR 8 million. A rescue team was already at the scene in Haiti on 13 January and, on 18 January, a further EUR 19 million of emergency humanitarian aid was made available by the Commission to enable the partners of the United Nations, the Red Cross and the NGOs on the ground to help the victims. By then the Member States had already announced EUR 92 million of emergency humanitarian aid. In total, more than EUR 300 million were allocated in just a few weeks to meet the country’s immediate needs.</p>
<p>At the ministerial-level International Donors’ ‘a New Future for Haiti’, which took place on 31 March in New York, the EU pledged more than EUR 1.2 billion over 10 years for the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti, thereby reaffirming its long-term commitment to that country. The citizens of Europe and European civil society also took action to raise more than EUR 600 million to support the relief and reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>I think that, all in all, we can be reasonably proud of the action taken by the EU as a whole to support the Haitians at a particularly difficult time.</p>
<p>With regard to the current humanitarian situation, it is true that, some seven months after the earthquake of 12 January, the humanitarian situation is still fragile for hundreds of thousands of people, in spite of the huge amount of aid given to Haiti by the broader international community. We do not have the time to list the needs and the challenges that lie ahead. The most important aspects of the challenges to come are described with sufficient precision in the situation report regularly updated by the ’s Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO). I have also noted with interest the edifying findings mentioned in the mission report of the European Parliament delegation led by Mrs Striffler, which went to Haiti at the end of June.</p>
<p>As also pointed out in the European Parliament’s mission report, it is important to emphasise the positive aspects of the humanitarian action taken so far, especially the fact that this action, while indeed not perfect, has so far averted a serious health crisis and epidemics, the outbreak of which was very much feared in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>
<p>There is obviously still a huge amount of work to do, and I wish to reassure Members that the European Union of course remains mobilised.</p>
<p>The country must now begin the process of reconstruction in a tense pre-election context, marked by a worrying level of insecurity. One of the difficulties we will have to face in this context is associated, as you know, with the state of the capacities of the Haitian State itself.</p>
<p>Over the next six months, the emergency shelters will have to be maintained, given the delay in the implementation of a strategy for the construction of transitional houses. The internal displacement of people outside the zones directly affected threatens the survival of families taking in the victims. It will be important to provide these families with adequate support in the coming months.</p>
<p>The hurricane season started at the beginning of June. In the medium term, the national authorities and the international community will have to prepare, as far as possible, for this additional foreseeable threat.</p>
<p>As you will know, it is mostly officials from the European Commission and the Member States who implement the decisions and commitments of the EU and the Member States on the ground. I therefore invite the Honourable Member to approach the Commission, too, in order to obtain more information about the current humanitarian situation in Haiti.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0383"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council at the September I 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Under the European ’s linguistic system, Irish is one of the 23 official and working languages of the Union’s institutions. However, for practical reasons and as a transitional measure, in accordance with the derogation provided for in  2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the institutions of the European Union shall not be bound by the obligation to draft all acts in Irish and to publish them in that language in the Official Journal of the European Union. Nevertheless, the regulations adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council are drafted in all the official languages and, consequently, also in Irish.</p>
<p>The Council conclusions do not form part of this category of documents, so there is no requirement to publish them in Irish. That said, the Council would point out that it makes every effort to ensure that the Irish language is used in its documents.</p>
<p>Indeed, since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 920/2005, the Council and its General Secretariat have constantly endeavoured to have a sufficiently broad team of Irish-language translators in order to provide the greatest possible number of translations. Since 1 January 2009 this team has been an independent unit within the language service of the General Secretariat of the Council and includes 14 translators, a national expert on detachment and 7 assistants. As the EPSO competitions did not achieve sufficient results, 10 of these translators and the 7 assistants were recruited, as temporary agents, by means of selection tests organised by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Chagos islanders were removed from their home, the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), between 1968 and 1973 by the UK government, in order to clear all 65 islands of the archipelago of its population.

In consequence, the entire population was forced onto cargo boats and set down in Mauritius and Seychelles, over 1 000 km from their homeland. They and their descendants have lived in exile in Mauritius and Seychelles. The community now consists of approximately 5 000 people, with only 750 surviving adult natives.

<p>(FR) The objective of the European Union border policy, as laid down in the  Programme, is gradually to develop the integrated management of the external borders. Several important measures have already been adopted by the European Union towards achieving this objective. These include, at the legislative level, the adoption of the Borders Code; at the operational level, the of the FRONTEX Agency; and, at the financial level, the creation of the Borders Fund.</p>
<p>In line with this objective, in its conclusions of 25-26 February 2010, the Council 29 measures for reinforcing the protection of  external borders and combating illegal immigration. Among the main challenges facing the Union in this area in the foreseeable future, the measures list the improved efficiency of the  Agency, the development of the European Surveillance System (EUROSUR), and solidarity and the integrated management of the external borders by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Council is closely monitoring the activities of the  Agency as regards assistance and the coordination of operational cooperation in respect of the activities carried out by Member States to protect the external borders. It is currently examining the for a regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 aimed at revising the mandate of the Agency in order to enhance its role and operational capacities.</p>
<p>The Council will also examine the legislative proposals being drawn up by the Commission concerning the introduction of new technologies in the management of the borders, in particular the introduction of a system allowing the electronic recording of the dates of entry and exit of third country nationals and a system for the granting of Traveller status for fide travellers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0394"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council actively supports the holding of a referendum on the self-determination of South Sudan (in January 2011), which it considers a fundamental element of the 2005 Peace Agreement, to the implementation of which the EU steadfastly contributes. The Council has supported this position for a long time and has repeatedly affirmed it in its public declarations. At its meeting on 26 July 2010, the Council stressed that the EU was ready to support the referendums to be held in South Sudan and in the Abyei region, by providing substantial technical and financial assistance, as well as the implementation of the Peace Agreement, by reaching an agreement on post-referendum issues and by working towards long-term stability in the region.</p>
<p>The Council also supports the work of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan. It promotes building and support to help Sudan the challenges it is facing, well as efforts to combat insecurity and to conclude a lasting peace agreement for Darfur. The Council also supports the work of the Criminal Court and the provision of humanitarian and development assistance throughout the entire country.</p>

<p>(EN) Both the Member States and the EU need urgently to do more to improve the employment situation of young people and to tackle long-term unemployment, and this is recognised clearly in the EU’s Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. One of the five Europe 2020 headline targets seeks to increase the employment rate of women and men aged 20 to 64 from the current 69% to at least 75% by 2020. The Commission believes that, despite the current economic situation, meeting that target can realistically be achieved by 2020 if the Member States implement the necessary structural reforms of the labour market.</p>
<p>The headline target for employment reflects one of the strategic challenges that will face the European Union over the next decade: the ageing of the population, which involves a growing numbers of people of retirement age who will need to be supported by a smaller active working population.</p>
<p>The Europe 2020 strategy’s key tools for meeting the headline targets are the Integrated Guidelines and a series of seven flagship initiatives. The Integrated Guidelines, and in particular the Employment Guidelines, set out a number of policy priorities for implementing Europe 2020 in terms of combating youth and long-term unemployment. Guideline 7 aims to increase labour-market participation and reduce structural unemployment by means of adequate flexicurity policies, improving job quality, reviewing tax/benefit systems, active ageing, gender equality, work-life balance policies and combating youth and long-term unemployment. Guideline 8 concerns the development of a skilled workforce that meets the labour market’s needs and the promotion of lifelong learning. Guideline 10 calls for the promotion of social inclusion and support for groups at risk, including elderly women and men.</p>
<p>Various actions have already been taken at both Member State and EU level, for example through the mutual-learning programme as part of the European Employment Strategy. This involves the exchange of best practice at EU level and improving the transferability of the most effective policies, in particular targeting long-term and youth unemployment. Further measures to support vulnerable groups, including young people, by stabilising and alleviating the impact of the crisis on them were introduced through the coordinated response discussed most recently at the Employment, Social Policy and Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council meeting of 7 June 2010.</p>
<p>EU policy-makers in the field of youth also put employment high on their agenda. The Trio Presidency (Spain, Belgium and Hungary) has chosen youth employment as its common priority until mid 2011 and it is the central theme of the Structured Dialogue with young people. The Youth Council adopted in May 2010 a Resolution<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on "the active inclusion of young people: combating unemployment and poverty".</p>
<p>The Commission will present a Communication on the flagship initiative ‘Youth on the move’ in September 2010. It will set out in detail the action needed in the coming years to improve the situation of young people in Europe. In particular it will cover action to improve young people’s transition from education to the labour market, a crucial concern of those looking for their first job with little or no work experience. The Communication will also outline the way such action, which falls largely within the Member States’ responsibility for education and employment policy, can be supported by EU funding, in particular the European Social Fund (ESF).</p>
<p>The ESF plays an active role in supporting young people. When targeting youth unemployment, actions financed by the ESF focus on various projects in the Member States and regions either to facilitate transitions from education to work or to help young people back into education in order to raise their skill levels and combat early school-leaving. According to the latest data available, around one third of ESF beneficiaries are young people (the ESF helped 2.5 million young people in 2008). The ESF also allocates EUR 8.3 billion directly to reforms of Member State education and training systems which mainly target young people: this represents about 11% of the overall ESF budget.</p>
<p>The ESF’s priorities also include combating long-term unemployment, which it does by stepping up access to employment for job-seekers and inactive people and promoting their sustainable inclusion in the labour market. Actions to prevent long-term unemployment and facilitate the re-integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market form part of the operational programmes at Member State or regional level. During the current programming period, about 30% of the overall ESF budget (EUR 21.7 billion) is devoted to improving access to sustainable employment, which covers programmes for the long-term unemployed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) More than 70% of Africa's poor and hungry live in rural areas where agriculture forms the main economic activity. In these areas, small-scale farming is dominant with around 80% of farmers in Africa, many of whom are women, working less than two hectares of land.</p>
<p>In its recent Communication on food security in developing countries<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission expressly stated that investments in the smallholder sector have to be prioritzed since they yield the best returns in terms of poverty reduction and growth. A stronger investment in rural development can play a key role in reducing inequalities and conflicts and in slowing down migration from rural areas to cities.</p>
<p>By giving priority to support for small-scale farmers to increase production in a sustainable and efficient manner, the Commission strives to reduce poverty and hunger as well as desertification and depopulation of large areas. This approach is supported by Parliament and the Council<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the EUR 1 billion Food Facility, an initiative of the EU as a rapid response to the soaring food prices in developing countries in 2007-2008, has been to mobilise farmers and smallholders in target countries in order to increase productivity. Of the EUR 1 billion, all has now been committed, and so far EUR 625 million have been disbursed. A very large part of this goes towards helping small scale farming.</p>
<p>A good example illustrating this is a project in Zimbabwe, where the Food Facility has helped supply 176 000 small-scale farmers with 26 000 tonnes of seeds and fertilizers for EUR15 million. Another example is in Lesotho, where the EU is assisting over 36 000 farmers with more than 715 tonnes of seeds. This assistance will lead to 10-18 000 additional tonnes of crops harvested, which is a substantial boost compared to the total cereal production in 2009 of 86 000 tonnes.</p>
<p>However, other types of projects may also assist, such as the Pesticides Initiative Programme (PIP) programme, helping small scale farmers in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to meet European regulations and standards. So far 100 000 small farms in ACP countries have been assisted, helping them to keep their market in EU countries.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that by supporting small scale farming, providing them with the right inputs to increase productivity in a sustainable way, it can make a real contribution to the overall goal of catalysing a green revolution in Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission rejects and condemns any manifestation of homophobia as a blatant violation of human dignity. It also pursues a determined policy of opposing homophobic actions and campaigns for the decriminalisation of homosexual relations, both in the United Nations, but not least with partner countries. The Commission and the EU will continue to maintain pressure on partner countries to have legislation compatible with the international principles on non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Although admittedly far from ideal, in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement, the EU did manage to ensure the amendment of Article 8.4 in a positive way, introducing the concept of "discrimination of any kind", based on several grounds among others "sex or other status". This formulation is literally based on the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and did not exist in the Cotonou agreement before. The EU will now make use of these changes through all political dialogues with partner countries.</p>
<p>As an example of the commitment to the principle of non-discrimination, the Commission can mention the active role that both the High Representative/Vice president and the Commissioner in charge of Development played earlier in 2010 in a trial against a Malawian same-sex couple, as well as the Commission services, which made numerous approaches in Malawi at all levels of government and society. The couple was later pardoned by the Malawian president, at least in part due to European intervention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU's Political and Security Committee endorsed on 18 June 2010 the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of All Human Rights by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered people. This will now be used by all EU Delegations and geographical services.</p>
<p>Civil society in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries is obviously a critical actor and it is supported both under the European Development Fund and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.

<p>At the end of May a Commission study concluded that a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in the EU by 30% (compared with 1990) was affordable and technically feasible. However, the Commission - represented by the Commissioner responsible - took the view that the time was not yet ripe to proceed unilaterally with this more ambitious target. On 15 July the three biggest Member States called, however, on the Commission to increase the EU's target for reducing emissions to 30%. That is needed in order to stimulate the necessary investment in green technology and to keep the value of tradeable emission rights high enough to encourage a change in behaviour.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that circumstances are now favourable, with a view to the climate negotiations in Cancun, for pressing ahead with an emission reduction target of 30%? What steps will it take? And what role does it see in this for the emissions trading system?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The support from the French, German and United Kingdom ministers for a decision to move emission reduction beyond 20% is a very welcome contribution to the debate which the Commission launched with its Communication in May 2010<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It shows increasing recognition of the fact that this question is not just about commitments and burdens and international negotiations – but also about what Europe as a society will base its welfare and growth on in the future.</p>
<p>And let us be clear: while other countries have not yet signed up to sufficiently ambitious targets in the international context, some of them are moving very fast in any case. For example, in July 2010 it was announced that China may spend USD 738 billion on developing clean energy in the next decade.</p>
<p>But as far as the international negotiations are concerned, the EU is at present the only large emitter that has binding legislation in place on targets after 2012, bringing emission down in the EU to -20% by 2020. Regrettably, the other key industrialised partner - the United States - doesn't seem likely to adopt ambitious legislation any time soon.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that the EU should prepare itself for the situation when the Commission, Council and Parliament see conditions right to increase the target beyond -20%.</p>
<p>The 20% by 2020 target was always an intermediate one, and from the Commission's perspective there is no doubt that emissions will have to be reduced by 30% and even much more at some stage – the question is only by when - and when we take the decision.</p>
<p>In answering this question, one should not only look at what the outside does in the international negotiations, but also look at the self interest of the EU.</p>
<p>On this level the Commission very much welcomes the statements by the three ministers. In line with the Commission's analysis, they emphasise elements such as potential future oil price spikes, energy security, green growth etc. In other words, they agree with the argumentation in the Commission's Communication that this is also about the EU's self-interest.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that the Communication and its rich analysis will get similar attention in Parliament. It would be good to get input from Parliament on the type of policies the Commission should consider when assessing in further detail the impact of going to a -30% target.</p>
<p>With regard to the implications of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the Communication outlined some of them. A possible option for the EU to use the ETS to implement a 30% decision would be to tighten the emission cap over the 2013-2020 period by setting aside EUR 1.4 billion allowances that would otherwise be auctioned. This would ensure a cost-effective contribution from the ETS sectors to such a target. This effort would be complemented by emission reductions in the non-ETS sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission recognises the importance of energy security. One of the consequences of the 2008 Climate and Energy Package and other supplementary measures will be to lower the energy intensity of the European economy and thereby contribute to energy security.</p>
<p>For the time being and up to 2012, Member States from Eastern and Central Europe have to reach less ambitious targets under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is not necessarily a direct link between CO2 emission reduction target and increased dependence on natural gas. The EU climate policy offers flexibility to Member States that may choose between various options to reduce their emissions. Beyond the mere promotion of natural gas, alternative options to reach the reduction target include renewable energy production (including biomass), carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel power plants, international credits, or energy efficiency.</p>
<p>For the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), harmonised rules are put in place as of 2013 to avoid competitive distortions in the internal market, including for electricity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the perspective of new Member States - several of them rather coal dependent countries - has been given ample recognition in the Climate and Energy Package, via:</p>
<p>-	the option to derogate until 2019 from full auctioning in the power sector for existing power plants (new plants for which the investment process has not been physically initiated before 31.12.2008 are not eligible to avoid competitive distortions). Under this provision the new Member States shall invest corresponding amounts in retrofitting and upgrading of the infrastructure and clean technologies, also with a view to the diversification of their energy mix and sources of supply;</p>
<p>-	the redistribution of 12% of auctioning rights to the new Member States, which will increase the revenues for governments from auctioned allowances (these revenues can be used for a combination of investments in energy saving, improved energy efficiency, increased use of biomass and other renewables);</p>
<p>-	less demanding effort in terms of emission reduction outside of the ETS (effort sharing decision) and renewable energy targets.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission is well aware of the close link between climate action and energy security aspects. The specific situation of some of the Central and Eastern European Member States was taken into account when adopting the 2008 Climate and Energy Package, including through differentiated CO2 targets and special measures for the states concerned. There is therefore no need for additional measures. The priority is rather on full and timely implementation of the climate and energy package.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0357"></a>

<p>(EN) The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is a priority for the European Union. Since its launch in July 2008 and despite difficult political conditions prevailing in the Middle East, the 43 partners eventually managed to successfully implement the preparatory and transition phase for the setting-up of the Secretariat in Barcelona. Recently the Secretariat has signed a grant contract with the Commission covering 100% of the Secretariat’s provisional budget and making it possible for the latter to start its recruitment procedure and preparatory work on the project guidelines.</p>
<p>This being said, it also has to be acknowledged that the Union for the Mediterranean is not operating in a political vacuum. Political setbacks in the Middle East Peace Process obviously constitute a major obstacle for regional integration and the UfM process as such. The resolution of the Middle East conflict is therefore essential if we are to progress towards regional integration and sustainable peace.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the EU has lent its support to the UfM. In July 2009, the EU decided to provide funding (EUR 60 million) for five project priorities identified at the Paris Summit. We all have a vested interest in developing the institutional capacity of the Union for the Mediterranean, in particular its Secretariat, to promote regional integration projects and spur investments. The Commission is determined to help the Secretariat to deliver on its mission. Funding is available already in 2010 and additional funding can be made available for successive years once the cruising speed of the Secretariat is reached. The Commission is doing its utmost but financial support from other UfM partners will be important.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0365"></a>

However, the deal will have a discriminatory effect on sports fans from the UK, EU and beyond who happen to have another payment system such as Mastercard or Amex and want to purchase tickets or buy merchandise. It cannot be right that people are prevented from buying tickets to this significant sporting event simply because they have the wrong kind of card in their wallet.

<p>The Nord Stream gas pipeline is under construction, and the sad example of the Gulf of Mexico oil slick must alert us to the risks of this multinational project. That is why I would like to put a number of questions. There has been an obvious lack of appropriate responses by BP. Is the Commission familiar with the crisis management procedures provided for in the event of an accident at the Nord Stream gas pipeline? Is the Commission prepared to help Nord Stream with crisis management if any accident occurs? What state would be responsible in the event of an accident, and who would finance action to rectify damage caused by a disaster? Furthermore, Russia has not ratified the Espoo Convention, though it is a strategic and essential Nord Stream partner. What is the Commission's assessment of this situation, bearing in mind that, in his speech on 8 July 2008, Commissioner Stavros Dimas gave an undertaking that 'we always put pressure on third-party countries to ratify agreements of environmental interest'?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to inform the Honorable Member that Nord Stream has been subject to an environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as amended (the “Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive”), as well as with national legislation transposing the Directive in each of the countries through which it passes. Under the EIA Directive, the likely significant effects of such proposed projects on the environment should be assessed and the necessary measures to prevent reduce and, where possible, offset any significant adverse effects on the environment should be identified prior to the development consent.</p>
<p>In addition, as a cross-border project, Nord Stream has been subject to an EIA in a transboundary context, on the basis of the UN/ECE Espoo Convention. The Russian Federation has complied de facto with the Espoo Convention. The international consultation process lasted three years. All countries around the Baltic Sea were involved, and consultations as well as formal meetings among all the stakeholders, experts, administrative bodies and the public concerned took place in a transparent way. The EIA is part of the authorisation process and is a pre-requisite for granting permits to construct the pipeline. The competent authorities of all countries concerned have taken the results of the Espoo procedure EIA into consideration when issuing their respective national construction permits. The project received all required environmental and construction permits by the concerned countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Russia) and the construction started in April 2010.</p>
<p>The position of the Commission is that the Espoo procedure is the most appropriate procedure to assess the environmental impacts for this kind of trans-boundary project and that its ratification by the third-party countries shall be encouraged. Thus, on various occasions the Commission has reminded the Russian Federation of its view that Russia's formal ratification of the Espoo Convention would be a constructive step towards a further enhanced common responsibility for the environmental protection of the Baltic Sea as a particularly sensitive maritime basin. Russia agreed to abide by the rules of the Espoo Convention and a full EIA satisfying the requirements of the Convention was carried out, following which the necessary authorisations were granted by the authorities of the States concerned. This in essence means that for this particular case it did not make a difference if Russia had not ratified the Espoo Convention.</p>
<p>As a general remark, the Commission would want to note that the case of the Nord Stream pipeline cannot be compared to the risks that led to the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Nord Stream will carry natural gas and no crude or refined oil. Natural gas supply can be very easily controlled at the supply source. Therefore, in case of crisis, such as a rupture of the pipeline, the gas supply can be immediately shut down by the supplier. Consequently, the environmental risks are not similar to those of deep-sea oil drilling.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is not informed about crisis management procedures provided for in the case of projects planned and proposed by private developers, as is the case of this gas pipeline. This is the responsibility of Member States concerned. The Commission encourages the decision to set up a joint monitoring system for the Nord Stream pipeline by the countries concerned, as proposed in May 2010 during the meeting between the Prime Ministers of Finland and the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in the absence of a legal framework, the Commission always advises pipeline operators to define precise responsibilities and to conclude on the applicable law in advance. The Commission is ready to assist any project, upon request, to achieve legal certainty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission is aware of the importance of the socioeconomic role of the banana sector in EU producer countries.</p>

<p>(EN) Freight Transport Logistics focuses on the planning, organisation, management, control and execution of freight transport operations in the supply chain. According to information available to the Commission, the sector accounts for 14-15 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Given that transport alone accounts for 7 % GDP, this figure might well be realistic. On the other hand, given the very broad scope of activities which could fall under "logistics" it might also be too low.</p>
<p>The Commission has set out its main objectives with regard to logistics in the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, adopted in October 2007. The Plan, which covers 35 actions, has already delivered some tangible results (ITS action plan, freight-oriented rail corridors etc) and will be subject to a review during 2010 so as to keep it up-to-date.</p>
<p>The Action Plan gives due importance to the key contribution that professionals make to the performance of the logistics industry: 2 among the 35 actions of the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan, focus on the social aspects; namely on the qualifications, training requirements and on the attractiveness of the logistics professions. The Commission is addressing these issues with the cooperation of social partners, professional associations and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>As concerns the integration of transport modes, this is an important objective of the EU transport policy, to be reflected also in the forthcoming White Paper on transport policy. Therefore initiatives that support the integration of physical goods flows and information flows will be prioritised in the coming years. The on-going review of the TEN-T guidelines will target multi-modal infrastructure projects. The Commission is also moving forward in developing information systems for the logistics sector, in close collaboration with the developments ongoing in the customs area. Finally, in the context of FP7 a number of research and development projects have been addressing the issues of information and communication technologies in transport and logistics, both on EU and global level, notably "SMART-CM- Smart container chain management<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and INTEGRITY<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>- Intermodal global door-to-door container supply chain visibility.</p>
<p>With regard to the specific studies related to logistics, the Commisson would like to refer the Honourable Member to the impact assessment of the Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan that can be found on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>In conclusion the Commission can confirm its interest in promoting smooth cross-border logistics. Businesses' need for seamless logistics services requires a more integrated policy, which combines different modes of transport and different processes such as customs. This will be an important theme of the White Paper on Future Transport Policy which the Commission plans to put forward in a few months time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) From 2006-2008, the EU imported on average EUR 63,8 billion of agricultural products (chapters 1-24 of the EUs Combined Nomenclature, including fish products) from the 176 countries benefitting from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). EUR 11,2 billion of those EUR 63,8 billion were imported under the GSP preferences (under the three GSP schemes: GSP, GSP + and Everything But Arms – EBA). In addition, 67 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries currently benefit from full duty and quota free access to the EU market for all products (with the exception of sugar which is subject to special provisions) under Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Overall, 40% of agricultural imports from the GSP beneficiaries entered the EU market duty free under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) regime, 18% with GSP preferences and 16% with preferences resulting from bilateral agreements, including EPAs.</p>
<p>The impact of the EU's agricultural concessions to developing countries under the GSP scheme, as part of the wider universe of goods, is regularly scrutinised by the Commission, using both internal experts and external consultants.</p>
<p>The last available study by the external consultant CARIS on the mid-term evaluation of the EU’s GSP scheme<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> noted there was some positive evidence of the effectiveness of the scheme. In particular, the studies noted that the EU‘s GSP preferences can be effective in increasing Least Developed Countries' (LDCs) exports and welfare, that GSP utilisation rates are typically high, and that LDC exporters tend to benefit from preference margins received. Still, the analysis also notes that a number of factors, centred on some structural features, such as the generally low level of EU MFN tariffs and the structure of LDCs' trade, constrain to some extent the effectiveness of the GSP regime. The study includes sector-specific analysis showing that imports under the GSP regimes rose for vegetables and prepared foodstuffs. Sugar imports also increased under the EBA regime.</p>
<p>In the context of its Aid for Trade strategy the EU provides development financing seeking to integrate local farmers to regional and international markets. The Commission also regularly informs the beneficiaries' countries about the conditions required to fully seize the advantages of preferential access. In addition, the Commission created the Export Helpdesk, in 2004, as an online service about exporting to Europe, intended at facilitating market access for developing countries to the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Directive 2001/29/EC<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society provides the European legal framework for exceptions and limitations to copyright. Article 5(2)(a) of the Copyright Directive states that Member States may provide for exceptions and limitations to the authors’ reproduction right. The condition for such an exception is that authors receive ‘fair compensation’.</p>
<p>The recent opinion of Advocate-General Trstenjak in the case SGAE v. Padawan (C-467/08) interprets the requirements deriving from Article 5(2)(b) of the Copyright Directive, but large parts of the Opinion also apply to Article 5(2)(a). In her recent Opinion, the Advocate-General has made it clear that the Directive (2001/29/EC) can be interpreted as prohibiting levies to compensate for illicit copying (§ 78).</p>
<p>Fair compensation should hence not cover damages caused by reproductions of copyrighted works other than those falling under the legal exception, such as unauthorised reproductions of copyrighted works (i.e. piracy), or reproductions that have been explicitly authorised by the copyright-holder. Authors have the right to obtain compensation for such copies, either in court (for unauthorised reproductions), or by contract (for explicitly authorised reproductions).</p>
<p>Is it the Commission’s view that only legal acts of copying fall within the scope of the exception provided for by Article 5(2)(a) of Directive 2001/29/EC and that these are therefore the only copies that should be compensated for? Given the diverse interpretation and application of Directive 2001/29/EC across the EU, what measures does the Commission plan to take in order to address the negative consequences for the internal market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society provides that rightholders must receive fair compensation for exceptions and limitations from the reproduction right such as those relating to reprography (Article 5(2)(a)). As the Honourable Member points out in his question, as soon as Member States provide for an exception from the exclusive reproduction right for the purposes of reprography ("reproductions on paper or any similar medium, effected by a photographic technique or by some other process having similar effects"), only acts that fall within the scope of the definition of the exception are lawful acts. In addition, only such acts allowed by the exception can give rise to a claim for fair compensation.</p>
<p>Acts of reprography that are not covered by either a license or a statutory exception would be an infringement of the author's right of reproduction. For example, the reproduction of sheet music is specifically excluded from the scope of the exception. The unauthorised reproduction of sheet music therefore remains an illegal act and the copying of sheet music cannot be rendered lawful by the payment of fair compensation. In this respect, the Commission is cognizant of the need to fight piracy and counterfeiting. It is actively pursuing policies in consultation with all stakeholders on how best to address this phenomenon. Any solutions must be based on a coherent approach that does not undermine the legitimate interests and concerns of rightholders and consumers alike. This also means that fair compensation for lawful acts of reprography has to be distinguished from illegal copying.</p>
<p>The Commission has, in the past, undertaken a variety of initiatives to ensure a coherent interpretation of the above mentioned copyright exception. At this stage, the Commission is still engaged in a stakeholder dialogue aimed at clarifying such matters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
