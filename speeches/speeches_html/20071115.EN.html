<p class="contents">This process should be pursued by future presidencies. The objective is not to label or classify countries, but to tailor their instruments and responses to specific situations. In these situations of fragility, there are major obstacles to poverty reduction. Institutional capabilities in such situations are very limited, with states unable to assume the functions of governance, or with the consequences of natural disasters, violent conflict, or a lack of political will on the part of the government regarding development objectives. In extreme cases, these situations can have an impact beyond the country’s borders, affecting regional stability or even global security.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of fragility is not new, though the international debate is relatively recent. Donors, partner countries and civil society have been aware for a long time of the need to be more effective in particularly unfavourable situations in order to meet the objectives of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Every situation is complex and different and requires a tailored response, in which diplomatic action, humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and security and crisis management intervention all play a part.</p>
<p class="contents">The effectiveness of the European Union’s response requires a long-term commitment, but also the definition of clear objectives when taking action in a fragile country. The guiding principle should continue to be capability development and human security, within the perspective of sustainable development and poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving support to situations of fragility where this is to the detriment of successful countries should, however, be avoided. Commitments to strengthen aid therefore take centre stage again. The European Commission has presented a communication proposing a pragmatic approach for the European Union to engage more effectively in difficult environments for sustainable development, stability and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication was sent to all the European Union institutions. The General Affairs Council on 19 and 20 November will adopt conclusions on this subject. It will invite the Commission to draw up a specific work plan for implementing the recommendations and the priority actions presented in the communication, the aim of which is to address situations of fragility more effectively by supporting the efforts made by the partner countries to create or restore the conditions necessary for their sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">2008 will be devoted to preparing the European Union’s strategic approach to situations of fragility. This process requires the active participation of all the European Union institutions and all those working for development in the EU and the partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s contribution to this exercise is of great interest to the Commission, which is inviting it to get actively involved in this debate, that should make it possible to support an overall response strategy to situations of fragility and to contribute in this way to creating suitable conditions for sustainable development, stability, peace and democratic governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very grateful to the Commissioner for having laid down the ground rules and his views on how we tackle this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Fragility is a condition that has many, many parents. The first of course is the process of decolonisation when the colonial powers drew arbitrary lines on maps, which cut across all sorts of internal stable civil society functions and split countries into two or three or four, irrespective of their tribes or religious factions and so on. That induced a certain amount of instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a natural form of instability that fragile nations now experience: countries which are prone to floods; small island states that are open to only a single economy product. There are countries which are geographically unable to sustain themselves because of the way God has blessed them with very few attributes, countries which have desertification, starting to produce mass migrations of people.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 26 so-called fragile states in the world as we speak and the most vulnerable people in the world are facing catastrophic consequences, not through their own fault in some cases, but sometimes through bad governance, sometimes through internal conflict, sometimes through civil wars, sometimes through genocidal dictators as we found, not many years ago, in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>
<p class="contents">Now you can change a fragile state from being a fragile state to a post-fragile sustainable country, as we see happening in front of our eyes in Sierra Leone. But this requires effort; it requires commitment; it requires a long-term commitment, as the Commissioner said, to that country’s economic growth. It requires a commitment of nation-building, an expression which I use advisedly in this Chamber because the concept of nation-building is something that my country, the United Kingdom, has long experience of, as have France and Spain and some other European countries. But it is wholly and utterly away from the knowledge of other emerging superpowers who have not, to put it bluntly, a clue how to punch their way out of a paper bag in terms of nation-building.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be able to connect ourselves with the body of historic knowledge that is reposited in the consciousness of European nations, to help other nations who are taking a lead around the world in the process of nation-building. Had we done that, and had Prime Minister Blair done that, I think the situation in Iraq, for example, would have been completely different.</p>
<p class="contents">Is Iraq a fragile state? Yes it is, because it is unstable; the governance is not secure; there are insecurity problems. There are other countries in Africa which are very fragile – the Sudan, Somalia, small islands – as I said earlier all these require coming together with a body of knowledge that we already have and therefore I am very pleased indeed to be opening this debate this morning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this particular case, the essential message of our resolution can be summed up in one sentence and should attract support from everyone, beyond the political divisions. It is to propose setting up a simplified cooperation system that allows the Commission and Member States to supply the aid they have promised to partner countries in the throes of particularly grave crises more rapidly than they can today – and I will not dwell on these crises because Mr Deva has just explained them at length. Without this aid the populations of these countries see their chances of survival diminish each day. Once this aid has been approved, which is in itself no mean feat, the complexity and length of current procedures for delivering European aid can cause situations that are even more dramatic and directly harmful to the beneficiary populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of Burundi, a small country in which I chaired the parliamentary observation mission for the last elections two years ago, and to which I will have the pleasure of returning in a few days. The European Union has done a very important and remarkable job there, supporting the electoral and institutional democratisation process after more than ten years of bloody conflict. Once established, the institutions and the new democratically elected power were very quickly faced with reality and the needs of the population, in terms of health, education and agriculture, which had to be met as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no lack of projects in these sectors, but for them to see the light of day, European aid is utterly decisive. It is not only decisive for meeting the urgent needs of the population, but also to enable the public authorities, which are still fragile, to begin a reconstruction process without which there is a major risk of seeing the country descend very quickly into chaos again. Two years on, Commissioner, the budgetary aid announced by the EU has still not arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">What is true for the Great Lakes region is also true for other regions of the world. That is the reason why, Madam President, subject to the clear definition of the conditions they have to meet to be able to receive it, all the countries in the world with which the European Union is cooperating and that are experiencing a serious situation of fragility should be able to rely on an exception system that guarantees rapid and effective intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to the problem of the growing number of states recognised as unstable. Over the course of six years this number has almost doubled, from 14 to 26, so this is a very real problem, and one that is an increasing challenge for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that over half of these unstable states are in sub-Saharan Africa, which highlights the need for us to give particular attention to that region of Africa, that region of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that strong words need to be said about the need to build the authority of governments in these countries. The African Union is right to point out that the problem of reconstruction is also a political issue, perhaps more so than a technical one. In view of this, the mechanisms of democracy and transparency are fundamental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mr Hutchinson, who spoke before me, about the need to simplify procedures so that our aid might be more rapid and more real. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This afternoon we are, for example, discussing among other matters the case of Somalia.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution therefore enables us to tackle some of the more serious problems that have to be faced in those contexts – for example, the fact that this fragility is frequently based on a situation of extreme poverty that tends to bring with it institutional collapse and insecurity at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is also crucial to start from the principle that these states present a challenge in terms of development, and this means that we urgently need to define a coherent agenda based on the humanitarian principle of do no harm. This is the first principle, and it is an important lesson to learn from recent events regarding the approach taken by Zoe’s Ark in Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external action, in particular European action, in this type of context, this must be based on implementing programmes on the ground, which must be flexible and adaptable to changing needs and based on a strategy planned in the short, medium and long term. All too often we stop at measures that may be necessary in the short term, but which fundamentally lose sight of the medium and long-term consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must mention the importance of establishing a dual mechanism of accountability, in particular including an obligation for the recipient countries to be accountable, naturally, to those who have provided resources, funds and donations, but also to their own populations, whom they should and must protect and ensure the survival of. The donors should also guarantee that they are going to be accountable to these populations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that more and better cooperation for development is urgently needed in a world facing a new arms race and the increasing militarisation of international relations, led by the United States and its allies. It is for that very reason that we are seriously concerned about the attempts to make development aid conditional on security strategies intended in practice to achieve more or less concealed objectives of interference, plundering of resources and neo-colonialism.</p>
<p class="contents">An analysis of the international situation must not leave out or underestimate the external causes fomenting and exacerbating the contradictions which are so often at the root of the problems. We need only look at the very subjective list of what the World Bank considers to be fragile States. How many instances of external interference and aggression does that reflect?</p>
<p class="contents">We do indeed need an agenda for cooperation and development to respond to the most basic needs of millions of human beings, based on respect for national sovereignty and independence and peaceful solutions to international conflicts – an agenda which encourages the demilitarisation of international relations, which promotes equitable and fair economic relations and the cancellation of foreign debt paid for long ago, an agenda which overcomes the policies which are causing the profound injustices and inequalities, in order to build a fairer, more peaceful, more humane world of greater solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not enough to support government institutions. It is essential to promote the strengthening of parliamentary scrutiny, to support free and pluralist media, the independence of the judiciary and the empowerment of civil society, giving priority to women, vulnerable groups and minorities. That requires commitment on the part of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Somalia today tragically illustrates the aloofness of Europe. The causes of fragility that stir up violent conflict, exacerbating the incapacity of the state – bad governance, extreme poverty or violations of human rights, for example – must be broached in bilateral dialogue and often the Council, Commission and Member States fail to do that. The causes of fragility must be taken into account in defining strategies and in the globalisation of the EU’s financial instruments. Development aid must be focused on people and direct financial support for governments should be considered only when there is proof of commitment to resolving conflicts, to building the democratic rule of law and to improving governance and the human security of the peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and unfortunately this aspect is omitted from the Commission’s Communication and the resolution we are to vote on, the EU must invest more, alongside DDR and SSR programmes, in controlling global transfers of light weapons, since they fuel armed conflicts which perpetuate the fragility of many states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That a report of this scale has received no plenary amendments shows this is truly a report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and one we can all be proud of. I would also like to thank the Commission for its close cooperation and the Portuguese Presidency for making social policy a priority for its Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We face a huge challenge in Europe. That challenge is one of fairness. It is about lost potential, the inability to live a life free from the charity of others, and a life free from discrimination, poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is clear: we want to expand opportunities so that nobody, whatever their background or circumstances, is left behind. The vision of Europe must be freedom and opportunity for all, increasing opportunities and incentives to work, whilst strengthening the safety net for those who are unable to work.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007 the facts are chilling: 72 million European citizens continue to live in poverty; 8 % of all people in the European Union now suffer from in-work poverty. Those are truly shocking statistics. But what do they actually mean? They mean that one in six citizens is now living below the poverty line – one in six! Many people would not believe that could be possible in 2007. Fifty years after the Treaty of Rome, after 50 years of economic growth, 10 % of people belong to households where nobody has a job! By any measure, poverty remains one of the greatest social problems challenging Europe, and reducing social exclusion must be at the heart of our policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas we are succeeding, but we must be frank: in the majority we are not. The gap between the rich and the poor in many EU Member States is increasing. The elimination of income-related poverty must remain a priority for Member States but, for the one in six who live in financial poverty, there are many more who are excluded from society for other reasons. We have to recognise that for many families – for many individuals even – there are problems more complicated than simply low income. Barriers to opportunity are complex. More than anything else, early intervention is crucial. Prevention, of course, is better than cure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the UK, we know that the daughter of a teenage mother is three times as likely to become a teenage mother herself; we know that sons with a convicted father are over four times more at risk of being convicted of a crime than those without a convicted father. Yet, in many areas, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. We must look at how other EU countries deal with these issues and learn from them. We must share best practice more effectively. Finland, for instance, has introduced a holistic sustainable approach that has been incredibly effective in reducing the number of people who are homeless. Denmark, meanwhile, is implementing new policies that improve the quality of life of long-term rough-sleepers, rather than having the sole aim of integrating those individuals into mainstream society. In Belgium, people who have experienced poverty are working with social workers to help them better understand the needs of poor people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always unemployment that causes poverty: in-work poverty is a problem as well. That is why I have called for an exchange of best practice on the provision of a decent working minimum wage throughout the Member States. At least five EU Member States do not even have one. Equally, we must push all Member States to adopt a minimum living income for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must do more to prevent exploitation of vulnerable workers as well; to make sure that disabled and older people have a way into employment; to prevent trafficking; to safeguard the rights of asylum-seekers; to ensure equal access to healthcare and community services for all; to destigmatise people with mental health problems; and to promote a more constructive approach to drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">These are but a few of the issues this report has addressed. Europe’s vision must be freedom and opportunity for all. That is why it is so important to look at setting up mechanisms at a European level so that the exchange of best practice becomes a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to see that the European Parliament has decided to address the fairly wide range of social issues covered by this report, issues that need to be solved urgently. This report is a significant contribution towards social reality stocktaking on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This document comes at the time when the Commission and the Member States are examining the possibilities of strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy. We must respond to our citizens’ fears and we realise that social justice is one of the key problems for them. Public opinion surveys show that the European Union should play a key role in supporting more integrated and cohesive societies.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Barroso said during a key debate on globalisation yesterday morning, the European Union has made significant progress in achieving the Lisbon goals. New jobs are being created: 3.5 million new jobs were created last year alone. The unemployment rate has fallen to approximately 7%. Although this rate is still too high, it is the lowest it has been in the last 10 years. Economic growth has been satisfactory in spite of the recent financial instability.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no room for complacency. Implementation of the Lisbon Strategy has been uneven and not all of its goals have been met. Indeed, 12 million people are still unemployed, and these are often young people or long-term unemployed people with poor prospects for professional growth or social advancement; 8% of the European workforce suffers from in-work poverty; 78 million European citizens suffer from poverty and one in five European Union citizens suffers from inferior living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, more has to be done in order to meet our common social goals. Now, at a time when we are seeing the positive results of the European Union’s strategy in the area of growth and employment, it is the right time to begin to pursue social goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the reference in the report to the necessary political will and resolve to deal with issues of poverty and exclusion. I, too, feel that it is urgent to tackle child poverty, combat discrimination and enhance diversity. This of course means monitoring the transposition of the relevant legislation into national law and, if necessary, instituting proceedings against those Member States that have been found to infringe European Union legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also looks at the barriers that prevent involvement in society and integration into the job market. I agree that we have to combine supporting measures with suitable safety nets to ensure that no one is left out.</p>
<p class="contents">This attitude is reflected in the recent Commission communication on active inclusion. This communication defines three key elements of a balanced and strategic approach to active inclusion:</p>
<p class="contents">–	Access to integrated job markets;</p>
<p class="contents">–	Better access to services;</p>
<p class="contents">–	Adequate income support.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication also launches the second phase of consultation with the social partners on these issues with a view to stepping up European Union cooperation in the area of active inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this consultation, the Commission intends to draw up a recommendation on the common principles of active inclusion, which is scheduled for the second half of 2008. In a further communication due to be adopted in the next few weeks the Commission will also present new measures to support the active inclusion of people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful to the European Parliament for its persistent efforts to combat discrimination. As stated in the Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008, the Commission will present proposals in 2008 for solving the problem of the existing protection loophole under Article 13 of the Treaty. The proposals, which should be adopted by next summer, will be based on long-term dialogue with the European Parliament, on experience from the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and on extensive public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made significant progress in achieving gender equality, and the European Parliament has been an important partner in this process. However, we have to continue to strengthen gender equality in the future. This is a fundamental right, as well as a vital condition for achieving Europe’s goals in the areas of growth, employment and social cohesion. I therefore welcome in particular the report’s reference to gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam the Union has made progress in all areas of gender equality, and since 2003 in the area of equal opportunities for disabled people. That said, there is still a lot of work to be done in both areas. The fact that multiple discrimination still persists is a strong argument in favour of continuously emphasising equal opportunities in all areas. This topic will be dealt with in the Commission communication due to be adopted in 2008, which will be based on lessons taken from the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the changes in the EU’s social situation naturally follow the development of our society and the changes in the global concept as a whole. In spite of that, I am convinced that the fundamental concept, i.e. finding a balance between the economic and the social and ecological aspects, is still entirely valid. Therefore, the onus is on us to continue to look for new approaches that will help us to overcome problems that still exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards public health, we should focus on the problems facing EU citizens in the area of health care. Taking into account the demographic trends and the rising average life expectancy, we have to develop public health strategies that will improve our quality of life, with a view in particular to preventing diseases and combating them effectively. At the same time these strategies should take into account the need for high-quality, accessible and reliable health care for citizens from all sections of society, irrespective of their social status, age or country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">We should pay particular attention to the most disadvantaged groups, such as physically or mentally disabled people, the elderly and children. In view of the rising costs of health care, the Member States should adopt effective measures, such as targeted information campaigns, the use of generic medicines, the use of new technologies, mutual assistance measures at local level or greater solidarity between generations and in families. In addition to that, and in cooperation with the Commission, the Member States should develop policies and support European initiatives to combat smoking, alcoholism and obesity, which will help to improve the quality of life of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, we should focus on the effective implementation of the existing public health legislation. The Member States and the Commission should ensure the application of the Community legislation on water, air and soil quality, and noise pollution, as well as the application of the regulations on chemical products, including those covered by REACH. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The committee stresses that women and children are the main victims of poverty and social exclusion and points out that the risk is even greater in the case of immigrants, the elderly, the disabled and members of single-parent families. It also notes that, on average, 15% of pupils drop out of the education system but that, in some countries, such as Portugal, this rate is as high as around 40%, which gives cause for concern as regards the education and training of young girls.</p>
<p class="contents">It stresses the importance of maintaining quality public services, a solid public and universal social security system and high levels of social protection and quality employment combined with rights and of ensuring effective gender mainstreaming in the formulation and implementation of such public policies; finally, it urges the Commission and the Member States to give maximum priority to women’s social integration and women’s rights, by altering their respective policies accordingly, including income distribution policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lynne’s report, on which I heartily congratulate her, clearly does not and cannot have the last word on the issue of social inclusion and the transformation of social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often prone to think that the European social model is timeless, but social policy must clearly also change, not only through globalisation, but also through the economy, social expectations, the demographic challenge and changing values, since we must find suitable responses to the challenges we face. For this reason too the Commission’s initiative for preparing some sort of inventory of the social problems weighing on Europe’s population is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that nearly 500 million Union citizens are not one homogenous mass. Despite the fact that the differences in income between the old Member States are falling, the differences between the rich and poor regions are still demonstrating a growth trend. Two thirds of the population of the ten new Member States of the EU live in poor regions where the level of income is half, or less than half, the average income of the old Member States. The situation is even worse in Bulgaria and Romania, where the average income does not even reach one third of the per capita income of the old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that in order to fight poverty we need to know more about the different forms in which poverty manifests itself. However, to do this we need new poverty indicators, since up to now we have only had comprehensive data on the risk of relative poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s communication in relation to this. The report also draws attention to new risks of impoverishment. For example, we know little about how dangerous are the proportions assumed by the population’s debt. Of the 15 old Member States, the per capita debt of the population in 12 Member States exceeds EUR 16 000, which accounts for 90% of the average annual family income.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to say one last sentence, Madam President. The report again points out the importance of fighting child poverty, and we consider this to be extremely important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Social exclusion is caused by a wide range of factors, and it would be a great pity not to use this report for follow-up work. In my speech I would like to stress the importance of public services and their contribution to eliminating poverty and exclusion. Once privatised, public services will become more expensive and less accessible. I regret that we have not managed to adopt the position condemning those states that introduce a low basic tax, and so make it impossible to accumulate enough funds to carry out the State’s social tasks. It would certainly be useful for the Member States to inform one another of their successes as part of the exchange of information on proven methods. Of course I would also welcome the exchange of information on methods that did not pay off or even backfired. I know that this is not being done but I am sure that it would be useful if the social partners and non-governmental organisations made it happen.</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental precondition to ensuring that more and more citizens of the Member States do not find themselves dependent on often imperfect social welfare is the provision of an adequate number of reasonably well-paid jobs. We cannot tolerate the fact that some people who work often depend on social welfare. Consequently, we must seek to set up an adequate minimum wage in all Members States, either through legislation or through collective contracts, depending on the country’s traditional method. Efforts to adapt old age pension schemes are being stepped up. When taking steps to preserve the fundamental pillar – the State old-age pension scheme – all Members States should respect the relevant International Labour Organisation conventions that they have ratified. Integrating disabled people into the job market is particularly important. Therefore, we must look with a critical eye at the actions of those governments that have abolished various incentives for increasing the number of jobs for disabled people, and the Czech Republic is one of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that the Member States’ governments are directly responsible for reducing poverty. It is their duty to take measures to ensure that people have jobs, children attend schools and the poorest people are given social assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Union’s role in solving problems connected with poverty and inequality continues to be equally important. The fact that 78 million European citizens live in poverty and the social divide between the poor and the rich is getting bigger and bigger is a most serious indication that action should be taken at both national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States have adequate minimum income rates. However, there are still cases where the employers do not pay the established rates, thereby breaking the law. As I have mentioned before on more than one occasion, Lithuanians working abroad happen to experience such unlawful treatment. We should not tolerate employers carrying out such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Member States’ response to the Council’s call to reduce child poverty. However, they have not yet drawn up their action plans for tackling the problem. The disabled and elderly are particularly vulnerable. We must make sure they have access to at least minimal long-term care at affordable prices. The Social Fund has allocated resources for this. It is a shame they remain unused in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree with the rapporteur’s position on the necessity of sharing experience and following the successful examples of achievements in Social security. It is necessary to learn from those Member States that are making efficient use of resources allocated by the EU, to share their experience. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to gain our citizens’ trust in the European Union, in its institutions, we must solve the most difficult problems they face.</p>
<p class="contents">In the speech he gave in this House, Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, said that the French feel that the EU does not care about them and does not provide social security. French citizens have voted not against the Constitution, but against Europe, as they do not feel safe there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised to prepare a report based on the social realities, with an analysis of social trends. I do hope the main focus of this report will be the framework of actions, the framework that will define the methods of reducing or even abolishing poverty in Europe. Then we will be able to win the support of our citizens and perhaps start to feel that we are working for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As social policy does not carry as much weight in the EU as economic policy, this report is not EU stocktaking – as the title says – so much as a list of demands for sociopolitical measures in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments to make. Sociopolitical matters are within the competence of the Member States. We at European level may only make recommendations. Europe is in a state of imbalance because there has been economic but not social harmonisation. Europe has not become more just since Lisbon 2000. On the contrary, poverty is increasing. To truly combat poverty and make it possible for all EU citizens to live with dignity and justice, we need not only economic, market and competition aspects but also a social, just, ecological internal market for all people.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: often it is a case of ‘all talk, no action’. We know what the problems are. We do not really need studies and analyses. It is time to take action at last. It is not sufficient to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. We need an effective anti-poverty agenda, we need data – so that all people, including those who are unemployed, have sufficient basic income and can live in dignity. This is a matter of justice and is a human right for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The stocktake also shows the connection between poverty, overcrowding, social exclusion and increased ill health and shorter life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">The stocktake looks at the importance of the right to housing, work, social security and the rights of women and persons with disabilities. It also shows that problem gambling, alcohol consumption, drugs and smoking increase social exclusion. The conclusion is therefore that Member States must tackle these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">So far so good, but the reality is often quite different. Often these are just fine words because the EU, through various directives and regulations, with reference to the rules of the single market and competition rules, often prevents Member States from solving problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we subsidise wine producers and tobacco growing. The free movement of goods, for example, prevents Sweden from maintaining a restrictive alcohol policy, which is very important. Sweden has a gambling monopoly to limit gambling, but the EU is threatening court action. There is the same double dealing when it comes to the text of legislation on misleading advertising and on advertisements aimed at children, because the EU’s other hand adopts TV directives with product placement and advertisements aimed at children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to change the social reality but, in order to do so, public health concerns and environmental concerns must be given more importance than the competition rules of the single market, and social welfare and security must be given more importance than deregulation and privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The GUE/NGL Group is voting for the report and we will continue to do everything to improve social security for citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, upon reading the documents from the Commission, I was disappointed to find that the stocktaking process was not looking at social reality but at economic indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not convinced that economic indicators are a reliable measure of social reality. If they were, the improved economic status of Ireland over the last decades should be matched by improvements in social cohesion, rather than the rise in serious crime, addiction, suicide, alienation, family dysfunction, exclusion and loneliness that we actually see.</p>
<p class="contents">We would not just ask if a person is employed; we would ask if they are valued, connected and nourished physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually, and we would check whether the respect for this person extended to every person, regardless of age, size, ability, colour or any other characteristic.</p>
<p class="contents">To properly take stock of social reality, we would also look at the sustainability of the natural habitat of the human person: the family. With this in mind, we would not just look at the gap between rich and poor, but the gap left by family breakdown and social isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">To understand social reality, we must start with the reality of the human person that makes up society. I will give you just one example, and I hope it will illustrate the contradictory results we get if we look at the money and if we look at the man or woman. We all agree that women should have the right to work and find equality when they do. But when we exert economic pressure on women who would like to stay at home with a young baby to work rather than care for the child and push them into the workforce, we register a very high rate of employment and assume that this means a healthier social reality. However, if we look at the baby, hardwired for immediate maternal input, and see the loss he or she suffers, which scientists tell us will be neurological and lifelong, then we have to question whether this high employment really translates as an indicator of a healthy social reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The irony of short-term thinking, of focusing exclusively on the economics of a society, is that it is the welfare of the people and the family at a human level that ultimately has the greatest impact on the economics.</p>
<p class="contents">Look at the cost of a troubled people to the exchequer. Think of the cost of crime, drugs, dropping out, etc. Economic growth can be gobbled up by the growth of social problems. The word ‘economics’ comes from the Greek for management of the home. Economics should serve all people, helping them to be at home in their communities, at home in themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">If we get this right, we will have a very healthy social reality of which to take stock in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, the report’s 97 recommendations amount to calls for assistance for everything and everyone: the poor, women, men, young people, the elderly, the unemployed, low-paid workers, the disabled, those who suffer discrimination, the sick, the healthy of today who may fall ill tomorrow, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">I could say, with some irony, that the only group omitted from this report is those such as myself: heterosexual, middle-aged white men of right-wing political orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Without irony, however, I would say that there is not a single person in this House who does not agree that the weaker members of our society are entitled to protection and that a civilised society can ultimately be judged on the degree of social protection it affords to people who, for objective reasons, find it difficult to play a normal part in society. Therefore, you would have to be a bad person, as it were, not to support the catalogue of good intentions and social Santa Claus policy contained in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I shall not be endorsing this report. The fact is that the list of recommendations contains a number of things I cannot support, particularly with regard to immigration policy, integration and diversity, and also the lack of essential protection of family policy. The main reason I cannot endorse this report is much more fundamental, however. Social policy and everything that can be subsumed under the heading ‘social security’ is an outstanding example of a domain of the Member States, and sometimes of their federal states – not of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless someone in this House has a machine for producing money and resources from thin air, unless such a machine exists, social protection measures still have to be funded from taxpayers’ money. This means that choices have to be made and that, unfortunately, we cannot always play Santa Claus to everything and everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">There are essential decisions to be taken that are most fundamental to a whole society, and these decisions must be taken at the lowest possible level, as close as possible to citizens, and not in the ivory towers of Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience in my home country, for example, has been that Flemings and Walloons make fundamentally different choices on such matters as health care and their approach to unemployment. The Flemish and Walloon societies are different, their political and economic worlds are different, and therefore they opt for different approaches and priorities. If this is true of Belgium today, how much truer is it, <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, of the very different Member States of the European Union, for example the United Kingdom and Romania?</p>
<p class="contents">It would be one thing if this report were only a catalogue of good intentions, but the European institutions have been intending to appropriate the field of social policy for years, and that is not a good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are not only a rich source for Member States seeking social facts and data but also, in my opinion, a sure sign that the EU and the Commission are serious about a stand-alone social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we declare our commitment to the European social model, in the sense of not only extolling it as a tradition and historical achievement, but also of making it into a trademark for a united Europe for the future, then a stocktake of our social reality is a basic prerequisite. Particularly as a result of the enlargement rounds of 2004 and 2007, we must finally distance ourselves from the view that European social policy is an adjunct to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not entirely self-evident, for in many areas the dominance of economic policy in Commission proposals is, unfortunately, conspicuous. In this connection, I would remind the House of the Green Paper on ‘Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century’ and the flexicurity debate. The former was shelved by the Commission yesterday, news I can only welcome wholeheartedly while recommending the same course for the flexicurity proposals, which are directed at hard-won employees’ rights in the employment relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">All the points addressed in this report – many thanks to Mrs Lynne – are highly topical. I am thinking of the minimum-wage debate in my country and the wage claims that are supported by the current strikes on the French and German railways. When it comes to wages policy, we are right in saying that a full-time job must provide a living for the man or woman who does it. Anything else falls short of the Christian responsibility of employers for their employees. Work must be worthwhile – that must be the basic principle.</p>
<p class="contents">What always upsets me is child poverty, which I lament even in my own country. I believe we must pay special attention to this. It should not exist. Actually, I should like to see rapid efforts in the Member States making it redundant for us to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was myself invited to the conference in the Azores where we, the Commission and Parliament, together had a dialogue with civil society concerning these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to commend the Commission for taking these issues seriously through its new communication on social exclusion and by presenting a recommendation next year which takes up these issues. It is precisely as Mr Špidla says, the situation in Europe is generally very good with increased growth and more jobs, but at the same time the gulfs are increasing. The gulfs are increasing and poverty is increasing. There are big differences between Member States. In a number of countries the differences are extremely large, and I am not just talking about new and old Member States – there are new Member States with small gulfs and old Member States with large gulfs. We must deal with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Commission’s strategy with three pillars is very good. When it comes to work, jobs are not enough, because there are also bad jobs from which it is not possible to support oneself and which are not empowering. We must have good jobs which pay decent wages. We on the Committee looked at the situation regarding minimum incomes and saw big differences between Member States. We need an exchange of experience here to find best practice. Then there are the public services to which everyone must have access: social services, housing, health care and so on. The methods are the open method of coordination which we shall strengthen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention, before I finish my remarks, that today we are going to vote on Parliament’s position on, among other things, the forthcoming Integrated Guidelines. We must also include the social dimension in the Integrated Guidelines in order to combine growth issues and employment issues with a social dimension so that we see these issues not in isolation from each other, but as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the report’s aim, namely to focus various stakeholders’ attention on discussing what constitutes Europe’s social reality. This is a wide-ranging topic and for that reason I can dwell only on a couple of crucial points.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Nice Summit in 2000, the Member States undertook to bring about a significant, measurable reduction in poverty and social exclusion by 2010. Regrettably, action on that objective has not been particularly successful.</p>
<p class="contents">An open Europe based on free movement and free trade has contributed to the economic progress on which people’s well-being and a better quality of life depend. It has, however, become clear over the last few years that for many Europeans it is a matter for debate whether the net effect of globalisation, liberalisation and greater competition does anything to improve their well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the 21st century, the level of poverty and social exclusion in Europe are worryingly high. Mr Špidla recently said that about 20%, in other words one in five of our citizens, is in danger of falling into poverty. All the Member States have social services and social benefits, yet even after receiving them one sixth of people live in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we asked ourselves why this is the way things are in a Union which was not forcibly brought together? Why now, 62 years after the end of the war and 50 years since the Union came into being, have we been unable to guarantee people’s basic rights? My question is: is a successful economy an end in itself or should it be a means of improving people’s well-being?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, by providing social aid the Member States are committed to providing benefits equivalent to the minimum amount needed on which to live; to providing aid sufficient to fulfil this objective. We do not need to formally transpose reams of directives – there lies no more than self-delusion. This raises the question as to whether timely implementation of adopted texts is guaranteed at the level of the European Union institutions, including in the ‘soft policy areas’.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we should not focus solely on economic results and competition; we should also consider establishing greater social solidarity and sustainable social measures. And where we have adopted a decision to that end, we must also see to it that it is implemented. Our citizens expect that much of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tasks adopted at the Nice European Council have been carried out inadequately. There are still groups of people whose income is below the minimum needed to survive. Lack of economic independence also interferes with people’s sense of dignity. A general ban on discrimination, and a guarantee of equal opportunities, chiefly for disabled people, are obviously needed, but they do mean a rise in expenditure on social aims. Our populations are ageing, which gives rise to fears about the financial capacity of pension insurance systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Lynne on an excellent report, which draws attention to these and other important social problems in our countries and also to methods that could be used to deal with them. I most definitely support this draft.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw attention to a contradiction in the European Union’s approach to social and economic problems. The pressure to restrict expenditure on social aims prevents numerous social problems from being dealt with. One example that could be quoted is the reform of the pensions system in Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that there is much poverty in Europe. When I came in and saw my colleague Fernando Fernández, I remembered what he said in Puebla, Mexico, a few years ago, when we were both attending a conference on world poverty. He said then that poverty can be predominantly blamed on bad government, which exists all over the world. Therefore, those responsible for poverty are first and foremost national governments, and not the European Union. This is a call for national governments, who expect and demand so much from Europe but do so little themselves, especially where it is most needed, to accept responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I also met a friend of mine, Mr von Wogau, as I came into Parliament, and he asked me whether it was true that in Italy, the state pension for a widow or for someone is completely incapacitated is EUR 50 a month for life. Mr President, I had to tell him that unfortunately this is true. For this reason, as the only elected representative of pensioners in this Parliament, I say yes to a minimum wage for anyone lucky enough to work, I say yes to a minimum pension in Europe for all old-age pensioners and I say yes to anyone who is unemployed, out of work or without a pension, that they too should also be entitled to receive a minimum income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who wants to combat poverty – as Mr Fatuzzo has already said – must really focus more intensely on the older generation. We must stay abreast of demographic changes and also ensure, despite steadily rising costs in the health system, that it will be just as possible to age with dignity in the future. Older people have just as much right to comprehensive, quality-assured health care and long-term care regardless of their income or where they live.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need a targeted exchange of experience amongst Member States as to how best to organise and secure high-quality, affordable care. In particular, we must take into account the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from dementia. However, to do this, we need sound data; that is also why we are asking the Commission to provide us with these data as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In a social Europe, all patients must have equal access to evidence-based medicines and medical products. It is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs EUR 3 in Belgium and EUR 34 in Germany, for example. Therefore I am glad that, with this report, we are calling for the Commission and the Member States to enter into intensive dialogue with us, and with the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups, in order to develop balanced guidelines for greater transparency as far as the effectiveness and price of medicines are concerned. This is another contribution to reducing the costs of health care for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My colleague, Mrs Lynne, with her sensitive approach to social issues, and all of us with our amendments, have been involved in all the OMC actions included in the national action plans. The report on social reality stocktaking will give direction to the social policy of the Member States. It should take account of the fact that in Europe today there are serious demographic problems directly affecting social cohesion and solidarity between the generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The family is still not taken into account by Member States in terms of the support it should be given, although it forms the basis of society. Poverty is increasing, in single-parent families as well as in large families, not only because of lack of income, but also because of a lack of social support and equal treatment, especially in taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Families’ living conditions directly affect children, especially in the more vulnerable categories. Inequality of access to resources and opportunities is growing, limiting both personal development and the future economic development and cohesion of Europe. Would the EU, for each child born there, not be able to guarantee an income to cover those children’s living expenses and upbringing, equivalent to the per-capita income of each Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">Policy on the promotion of social cohesion must be based on participation in the employment market. It must also contribute to the social integration of individuals not in employment and those offering informal services within the family. For this reason, the Member States are called up on primarily to investigate ways of recognising the unofficial skills acquired when caring for children and dependent persons, such as preliminary training and work experience. This will facilitate their integration into the employment market and provide pension and insurance rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity between the generations must be maintained by making use of the knowledge and experience of older people and through its dissemination and use by younger generations. The Member States are called upon to promote systems for the exchange of services between the generations and to invest in voluntary schemes, whether of an educational, cultural or business nature.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be achieved by creating suitable infrastructures and providing information on increased opportunities for older people to participate in such activities, so that they do not become marginalised or fall victim to social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should not, however, make a mistake. We have many documents, we have many analyses, we have many debates and we have many words, but here, as for diseases, we need not only a diagnosis but also treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as you said, Commissioner, that we need European treatment, through the Union, its institutions and its mechanisms, in order to respond to the problems of today and tomorrow, taking into account that if we do not do it at Union level it will be impossible to do it solely at the level of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States that are making fast progress, such as mine, are beginning to be threatened by policies that are seeking to slow down, or, in other Member States, to establish unfair competition with the supply and social change that is taking place in our countries. Commissioner, please take account of the fact that the feeling is beginning to spread that European social policy, which in the 1960s and 1970s, as a Spanish trade unionist said to me in a letter today, was aimed at harmonising progress, and in the 1980s and 1990s limited itself to ensuring minimum requirements, is now beginning to slide towards a social policy in which there is competition between the Member States to achieve the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the risks that we face for the future include not only ageing and globalisation, but also the contagious lack of solidarity and aggressive, xenophobic and anti-European nationalism that is threatening both Europe’s current social victories and its future ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Social protection and social inclusion help to combat poverty and exclusion in preventive health care and many other areas, and are among the most important challenges for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘minimum income’ is often discussed in different ways in the Member State that I come from. However, I fully support Mrs Stauner’s approach with regard to jobs, full-time working and income. The social partnership is strongly established in Austria, which gives us a great opportunity, indeed one that is used in attempts to find a solution with the agreement of all those involved. This means we do not have as many strikes as in other EU states, where these are frequently the order of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely why a regulation at EU level must be approached very carefully. The different national social welfare systems mean that we must proceed very judiciously with any harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern must be to offer social protection to all employees and to enable their social inclusion. Naturally, it must also be possible, within the framework of subsidiarity, that Member States should, must and can have higher standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people are trapped in poverty by inflexible welfare rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that communications and guidelines will not solve these issues. While I do not underestimate the difficulties faced by Commissioner Špidla, we need to establish legal obligations on Member States to achieve the necessary changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Working people are seeing their pensions devalued and their job security undermined, and many fear the race to the bottom. The problem is that inequality is built into many Member States’ economic models. For many of them, including Ireland, the attitude is ‘Let us create the wealth. Then we will sort out the social problems’. This is to ignore the reality that social inequalities are a brake on economic progress and that we cannot have long-term sustainable prosperity for everyone if we treat social policy as an afterthought and fail to avail of the wasted talent of 72 million people, not to mention the human misery that hides behind that statistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Social values are changing and societies are becoming more and more multicultural. The current developments have expanded people’s horizons and given them more options when making decisions about their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Member States of the European Union are among the richest countries in the world, new types of poverty and inequality are still emerging. Tens of millions of European citizens continue to live in poverty. Social inclusion and social protection are basic values of the European Union and fundamental rights for all individuals. However, the Member States must step up their efforts to combat child poverty. Unless there are significant improvements in the inclusion of children from disadvantaged social groups even at pre-primary level, the number of pupils who drop out of school early will not decrease; nor will we be able to increase the number of people completing secondary school and thus gaining key skills. An increasing number of citizens will have to cope with social exclusion, unemployment and other socially undesirable phenomena that are harmful to themselves as well as to the economy and society.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, it is also crucial to combat youth unemployment. It is important to remove the obstacles in some professional training programmes so that they are more flexible and effective and reflect the needs of the labour market. This will significantly improve the opportunities for disadvantaged people to assert themselves. Strengthening social cohesion and eradicating poverty and social exclusion must be political priorities for the European Union and its Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do think that European social funding and national programmes like the New Deal in the UK are essential active labour market measures to tackle the real barriers which prevent groups in our society from progressing from worklessness to work and that work is still one of the best devices for us to combat poverty.</p>

It would be very difficult to give a detailed answer to the individual comments, so allow me to provide a brief summary in response.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it seems to me that the debate has clearly shown that Parliament’s welcomes the idea of social reality stocktaking, and though I agree with Mr Cercas that diagnosis is not the same as therapy, I am also of the opinion that no therapy is possible without diagnosis. Our society is constantly changing and we have to find new methods to adapt to it or reform the old methods. For this to be effective, we need to understand the global picture.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the debate has another common denominator, and that is that although the social reality has its own dynamism to some extent, we also have our own values: a general European concept of a European social model that encompasses social inclusion and social protection and activity in general. It is therefore not acceptable in our model of thinking and acting to adopt a passive view. There is always the possibility of trying out active politics and active intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a third idea that I would like to stress. There is no doubt that, like most policies, the majority of European decisions also comply with the principle of subsidiarity, according to which the policies to solve a given problem are dealt with in the best and most effective manner. This means that there is no doubt in relation to the position of the Member States on social policy. On the other hand, the debate also clearly shows that the goal cannot be reached at Member State level alone, without efforts at European level. It is therefore our duty to find the most advantageous and effective synergy in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate brought to light a concern that I also share to some extent: a concern that there is a risk that inequality and the incompatibility of the social policies in individual Member States may lead to competition that possibly lowers social standards. The European Commission does not want to open this door. Our fundamental concept is to make individual European social policies compatible in such a way that will ensure competition and development from the bottom up, with a view to progress that always includes a social dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the debate also clearly shows that social and economic policies cannot be designed on an ‘either/or’ basis. The only possibility is ‘not only/but also’, which means the balanced development of both policies together, without making giving preference to one over the other. The usual trend is to give priority to the economic policy. However, I could see clearly from the debate that this approach is not favoured by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you mentioned a wide range of individual problems, notably the issue of the health service, including access to medicines and its overall organisation. You discussed the effects of demographic ageing and the importance of services of general interest. I am glad that all these views are represented in the European Commission’s strategic documents. We aim to integrate them into a general global strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me in conclusion to express my thanks to Mrs Lynne, whose report, which is currently being discussed here, is without doubt an important element of the global effort to ensure progress across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the spirit of compromise and, I hope, to win the support of the whole House, I would like to propose the following oral amendment. In recital A, we refer to President Musharraf ‘suspending the Constitution and the rule of law and replacing them with martial law’. I would like to propose that we say that he has replaced them ‘by the state of emergency, de facto martial law’. Then, in line with the suggestions made by other colleagues, in three other places, paragraphs 1, 10 and 11, we should replace ‘martial law’ with ‘the state of emergency’.

In fact, the Bali mandate means that at the Bali Conference the countries which have ratified the climate treaty will try to obtain a negotiating mandate to make it possible to establish the next climate treaty. In other words, the Finnish text in section 1 which says ‘to agree on a negotiating mandate for the conference’ should say ‘on a negotiating mandate for a treaty at this conference’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, the Schengen system stands or falls by a strict, watertight control of its external borders on the one hand – which, to be perfectly clear, is not taking place – and by a rigorous approach to crime in all Member States, coordinated in all Member States, on the other – which is found far too rarely. Finally, all Schengen countries must also conduct a strict immigration policy, something that is completely at variance with, for example, the waves of mass legalisation seen in quite a few Member States in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, as an individual and as a politician, I cannot rejoice at no longer having to pass through border controls at internal borders, since criminals and illegal immigrants do not have to do so either, and that is pernicious to our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally believe that this decision is absolutely vital. The accession of our countries, including my home country, the Czech Republic, should not be postponed under any circumstances. All the analyses to date objectively state that all these countries are adequately prepared for the enlargement of the Schengen area. Thanks to an incredible effort by the relevant Members States, the many experts involved in the inspections, the police, judicial authorities, officials and others, today these Member States are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> in a satisfactory manner. I therefore assume that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will also express its support for this decision on 6-7 December this year. The symbolic importance of the elimination of the internal borders that our citizens associate with joining the Schengen area will go down in history and can only be compared with the fall of the Iron Curtain almost 20 years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appreciate the effort and openness of the Member States and the Commission during the intense technical consultations required prior to the enlargement. The enlarged Schengen area will no doubt present greater challenges for Europe’s internal security, but on the other hand, and I would like to emphasise this, it is the culmination of the efforts to achieve free movement in a truly integrated area. Next year Europe will be united as it has never been before. The Iron Curtain is definitely gone and I thank you for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also supported Amendment 13 which would have meant that we should adopt a recovery plan worthy of the name. The proposal went considerably further than the original proposal, which is something we fully support.

<p class="contents">In view of the truly critical state of bluefin tuna stocks, the European Union is reacting as follows through this regulation: a steady reduction of catch quotas, a restriction on fishing periods, and a stepping up of control measures to combat illegal fishing. I support these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however plagued by a certain pessimism.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly this is because scientists are already saying that the provisions in this regulation are not enough to guarantee the recovery of stocks. They believe there would be good reason to set quotas going well beyond the annual catch rates set by ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas). I am inclined to believe them, so I have lent my support to Amendment 13 tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the presence in the Mediterranean of fleets from non-EU countries such as Libya, Turkey, Tunisia, Japan and China, which are not members of ICCAT, it is clear that the regulation we are looking at will only have an effect if these countries sign up to the provisions it lays down, and there is no certainty they will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The plan provides, amongst other things, for a steady reduction in the catch quota, closed seasons, an increase in minimum size and an observer scheme on board fishing vessels and on fish farms.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation adopted also provides for financial compensation to be paid to fishermen during the closed season with a view to safeguarding the fleet and employment in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think it is important to improve control, periodically updating the volume of catches by the various vessels to prevent some countries from exceeding allocated quotas to the detriment of others, as happens at present. You will recall that the bluefin tuna fishing season was closed from September to December because it was suspected that some countries had already exceeded the quotas, as turned out to be the case.</p>

That is why we want to express our satisfaction that Parliament confirmed this by adopting Amendment 7. We are not alone in our view. The UN’s climate panel, the IPCC, also confirmed the role of nuclear power as a low-emission form of energy. Perhaps, too, we should remind ourselves that this House took an historic decision in connection with Mr Reul’s report, with 509 votes in favour. The European Parliament recognised that nuclear power was, at the present, the EU’s most important energy source with low carbon dioxide emissions, and at the same time highlighted its role in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, our Group did not support section 25 in the resolution because in our opinion it needlessly linked or compared the peaceful use of nuclear power with the spread of nuclear weapons and the threat of terrorism. We should remember that there are no moral censors in the atmosphere. It does not shun one form of energy or sympathise with another for ideological reasons. Only freedom from emissions has any importance, and now the emissions are not welcome. In any case, I wish to say we are pleased that this House sent out a clear message for the Climate Conference and recognised the seriousness of the threat of climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is different in nature in the Mediterranean Neighbourhood compared with the Eastern European Neighbourhood, where many countries released from the Soviet area of influence are openly declaring a desire to accede to the European Community. In this event, as Poles, Hungarians and Lithuanians well understand, any substitute forms of involvement will not satisfy national ambitions. They have less influence on the required direction in political and economic evolution in these countries. They provide less of an incentive to reinforce the procedures of a state based on democracy and the rule of law and economic market principles and a genuine respect for citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at this from the perspective of a European Union border country like Poland, it would appear that the best policy is maximum openness to the aspirations of countries located beyond our eastern border. This is clearly linked to creating an area of stability around the European Union and limiting the field of action of demagogy, of which there is plenty in young democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also justification for a budgetary effort based on ENPI, the new instrument to replace the TACIS and MEDA programmes, which supports the desired processes in our part of the world. So far, the Eastern European Neighbourhood has been less well funded than the Mediterranean Neighbourhood.

This would help to reinforce the market economy, democracy and the civil state, which will bring Ukraine closer to EU membership.</p>

<p class="contents">Hence a whole programme and panoply of instruments which, in our opinion, amalgamate and confuse the ‘borders’ between ‘aid’ and interference, for example in such fundamental issues as ‘state-building’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly an urgent need to show solidarity with many countries that have inherited disastrous situations from colonialism and that are the victims of decades of interference, but such solidarity, in order to be effective, must be based on respect for the principles of national sovereignty and independence and on an effective and genuine development aid and cooperation policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violence suffered by Christians around the world is both an affront and a challenge to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">I intended to table this draft resolution at the last plenary in October, but the coordinator of the political groups asked me to postpone the resolution until the November plenary, to give us time to prepare a more detailed text backed by a broader consensus. In the text that we will be voting on this afternoon, which is the result of a compromise between socialists, liberals, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and the Independence and Democracy Group, the salient features of the initial draft resolution have remained.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been able to insert concrete references to acts of violence and abuses committed this year not only in the Middle East, but in other parts of the world against Christian communities. These events mainly concern Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, China and Vietnam, and in fact the intense coordination carried out in the last few days and the consequent unearthing of numerous episodes that have occurred outside the Middle East has led us to find a new, more fitting title, which is ‘serious events which compromise Christian communities’ existence and those of other religious communities’.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously the text does not include all violence perpetrated against Christians, such as in Eritrea and North Korea. However, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to recognise the political message of this text, which is also aimed at those countries and incidents that have not been mentioned. From the outset, having to liaise with other groups has allowed me to clarify that this resolution in no way intends to rekindle conflict between civilisations. Europe has always been first in line when it comes to protecting minority rights and cannot continue to ignore the increasing harm being inflicted on so many Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, ladies and gentlemen, our Parliament can express itself on an urgent and important subject, for the protection of life and religious freedom, not only of Christians, but of millions of people of all faiths. I would therefore ask...</p>

<p class="contents">That is true of this resolution. Recital K deplores the situation of Assyrian villages in Turkish border areas. Why? Because the Turkish Government is actually shelling Assyrian villages, claiming that they contain PKK militants, which seems to be an unlikely situation. In recital S it also refers to the situation in Syria, to where tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of refugees have fled from Jordan and Iraq, but the border is now being closed.</p>

It would be felt as a nasty shock, a sign of aggression, an unacceptable intrusion by a religious authority in a non-EU country into relations between our Member States and religious minorities. Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you is also a Christian precept.</p>
<p class="contents">Seriously, would such a resolution be perceived as a call for tolerance and intercultural and religious dialogue? Certainly not! The European Union, so proud of its values, would be well advised to demonstrate on these ultra-sensitive issues a modicum of discernment and respect for international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">To tackle violations of the rights of people from religious minorities, to condemn the murder of Christians or restrictions on freedom to worship, we have a choice between two equally well-founded approaches. The first is to talk to a country, on the basis of its international commitments and the agreements between us, and ask it to investigate, try those responsible, and ensure the rights of religious minorities are respected, and that is what we do here regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second approach is that taken by the United Nations, through a resolution tabled by 12 countries and by all the EU states, concerning the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion, beliefs, and freedom of thought and conscience because, in international law – and this is very valuable – they are linked. An individual’s rights to belief, to religion, to thought and to conscience are interdependent.</p>
<p class="contents">What will we be doing today if we adopt this unacceptable text you are proposing? We will be ignoring the work being done by our Member States at the United Nations and taking a different approach which is likely to encourage certain countries to exploit religious issues in their international relations. We will be going against the balanced approach recommended, for example, by Mrs Jahangir, United Nations Special Rapporteur, currently under house arrest in Pakistan, and at the end of the day we will also be making the situation of religious minorities throughout the world, including Christians, more fragile.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, together with experts working on religious freedom, such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide, I say that this resolution simply increases the danger for those we want to protect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such forces range from disastrous natural phenomena to incomprehensible somatic and mental illnesses. Man’s powerless status has been made easier to cope with through his belief in a superpower entity he called ‘God’. Different human groups developed a different understanding and a different approach to God.</p>
<p class="contents">The result has been the creation of a large number of religions. Such religions are, of course, man-made and not God-made and therefore suffer from several weaknesses. Such weaknesses include fanaticism, dogmatism and failure to accept other people’s right to believe differently. These weaknesses differ in number and in intensity amongst different religions and unfortunately they have often been exploited by extremist religious leaders and unscrupulous politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">This has led to religious wars and to the committing of despicable crimes against human beings in the name of religion. Both Christianity and Islam, two of mankind’s main religions, have not been exempt from these sad inflictions and history is full of shameful examples to illustrate the point. Of course, with the passage of time, most religions became more mature and more humanistic and this is certainly true with Christianity. But this change has not happened with some other religions, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why in some countries, mainly Islamic countries, Christians are being persecuted, sometimes with extreme criminal vigour and sometimes with the consent of political groups and even governments. This is indeed a very sad state of affairs, which involves a range of countries or regions worldwide – some of them have already been mentioned in this Chamber today – but it is more specific in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution we hope to bring attention to the persecution of Christians in these countries and hopefully to help in making sure that the authorities, both political and religious, in such countries fully understand that such aggressive behaviour is neither compatible with the principles of respect for human rights nor with the true teachings of a caring religion.</p>

They predate both Christianity in Europe and Islam in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet these days they are often seen as an alien element in what is now a predominantly Islamic area. This is not merely the result of religious intolerance from certain quarters within Islam; the blame also lies with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Three times in history, Europe and Christianity have aroused aversion and hatred in that region. The first time was the crusades in the late Middle Ages, when occupying European armies took control of sites holy not only to Christians but also to Jews and Muslims. The second time followed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of last century, when Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Iraq came under British colonial control and Syria and Lebanon under French colonial control.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently in the third phase. Europe’s positions on Israel, Palestine and Iraq arouse great opposition in the Middle East, where Europe is suspected of focusing primarily on its own energy supplies, on safeguarding its own transport routes and on giving preferential treatment to those ethnic or religious minorities best disposed towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">One possible consequence is that Christian minorities may be unable to hold their own in the Middle East in the long term and be doomed to flee to Europe. Giving Christians and Jews in the Middle East leeway is a better solution, as indeed Europe must do to its Islamic minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Islamic or Arab League has never championed the rights of Christians as we have the rights of Muslims. It is therefore high time that we put this matter on the agenda. It is an act of justice, whereby I must say emphatically that the problem is not Islam. Christians in the Middle East have survived 1 200 years under Islamic rule. It is in our supposedly so advanced age that they are seriously endangered, especially in Iraq, which is occupied by the West.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge our own responsibility to make it possible for them to survive and live in freedom and dignity. Most religious persecution takes place in communist China, in pseudo-Christian nationalist Russia, in communist dictatorships – and also under Islamic regimes. For me, Islamism is simply a perverse dictatorship and ideology of the twentieth century. We Europeans have a duty in this regard, and we shall perform it.</p>

<p class="contents">Religious freedom is a value that we must bring to the fore. Although it is true that in some cases Christians risk persecution and criminalisation, it is for this reason that Parliament must protect and defend them, just as this Parliament has always protected and defended Muslim citizens who have been the victims of discrimination in the West. We believe that all religions can play a positive role, a peacekeeping role, to encourage respect for diversity. For this reason we must strongly condemn any form of religious fundamentalism, which is so often a factor in conflict. I believe that this Parliament must always endeavour to listen and promote interreligious dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some notable examples that show how it is possible to construct a solution in which religions can listen to each other and build on common ground. I am also anxious to recall the sacrifice of some Catholics, some Christians, who have fought to free the poor, for peoples and for social liberation. This is why our group is voting in favour of this resolution, in memory of priests such as Peppino Diana and Pino Puglisi, who died because of their stance against the mafia and organised crime in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every day peace-loving Christians are under threat of systematic oppression and are used as scapegoats in crises they are not involved in. This is totally reprehensible and an issue it is necessary to highlight. Actually to improve the position of Christians, however, it is important to understand the problem as part of a wider whole. It is not only Christians who are having difficulties, but in many countries Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Sikhs and Ahmadis also have problems. The list is long.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of religion is essential for a society which respects human rights and civil liberties. It is, as it were, a meta-right, in practice a prerequisite for the existence of other human rights, which reflects the condition of society as a whole. If a society starts to get ill, it is visible first in the shape of restrictions on freedom of religion and in the status of religious minorities. For this reason we have to show our firm support for the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that in many countries, like Pakistan and Indonesia, religious communities are striving jointly to establish freedom of religion and the protection of minorities. Religion itself might therefore also be a solution. A pluralist dialogue always leads to less tension and benefits freedom of religion and society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regardless of the differences between them, the Christians there have managed on many occasions to demonstrate that they are able to live alongside Muslims, Jews or followers of other religions in peace and mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Lately, however, we have seen actions by adherents of the Islamic faith that have come down to a practical implementation of the false notion that being anti-Christian shows what a good Muslim you are. The Lebanese journalist Hazem Saghieh made this point recently. Numerous and often drastic instances of violations of the rights of people who, solely because of their Christian faith, are treated as second-class citizens are evidence of the violation of the fundamental principle of human freedom: the freedom to practise a faith.</p>
<p class="contents">The question needs to be asked: What can we in the European Union, which is open to and respects the rights of Muslim co-citizens, do for Christians who do not even have a modest fraction of such rights in those countries? Where is there the slightest reciprocity? There is none to be found in religiously motivated murders, nor in widespread discrimination, nor in the failure to give consent to the building of Christian churches, nor in the ruination of memorials to Christian culture.</p>

One reason for this is the rise in the influence of Islamic fundamentalists, who heap blame on them for every failure suffered by the people of the region. Because of their religious ties with people in the West, they are also accused of westernising the traditional social structures, about which people in the Middle East are very unwilling to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">One way in which the fundamentalists express their dissatisfaction is by organising anti-Western demonstrations, during which they destroy symbols associated with Christianity and shops run by Christians. In extreme cases even murders are committed. The passiveness of governments means that increasing numbers of Christian families are deciding to emigrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution outlines a number of problems encountered by Christians in the Middle East. These are not all the examples, however, so in my view the European Parliament should prepare a full-scale report on the situation of Christians in the Middle East, or the situation of religious faiths generally.

I have no doubts whatsoever about this resolution. I support it wholeheartedly. The only problem is whether we are effective, whether we will be effective and whether we will change anything. There are three ways in which we can act.</p>
<p class="contents">The first way is through diplomatic pressure. That is what we are currently doing. European governments need to be mobilised too, however. Every diplomat should bear this in mind. We must push for such actions in bilateral and multilateral talks. The only way to get a good result here is through large-scale diplomatic pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second way is through economic sanctions. I know from my own country’s experience 20 or 30 years ago what economic sanctions meant for the Communist government in Warsaw – well selected sanctions, so as not to cause harm to citizens. We must use this method too.</p>
<p class="contents">The final way is through thorough analysis of our actions, because countries in the Middle East and other parts of the world have their ups and downs. This also depends on our actions, which are not always very coherent or prudent. This means intervention, cultural events, and also speeches from diplomats. We do not want to hide our convictions.

Where Uzbekistan and more broadly the whole of Central Asia are concerned, there is a danger that in assessing the region’s energy resources the interests of individual countries will begin to prevail over our common values. Unfortunately, this is also apparent in the inability to agree on a motion for a resolution in support of the EPP and the UEN on the Council Decision suspending the visa ban on Uzbek officials for six months without a genuine change in the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution also refers to the very critical human rights situation in Uzbekistan. To date, however, there has been an understanding in Uzbekistan, and I heard this with my own ears, that human rights are an internal matter for that country. We cannot agree to this approach and I urge you to support the first, more critical version of the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we find it equally unacceptable if, within this very House, diplomatic relationships and interparliamentary cooperation between the EU and Uzbekistan are risked without giving it a thought. When I look at the motions for resolutions presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the left-wing groups, it is tantamount to a diplomatic demolition derby.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s last resolution, dated October 2006, we committed ourselves to a constructive, dialogue-oriented solution. Today, however, we are not seeking dialogue but slamming a door shut. My group cannot answer for this, so I ask you to reject the motions for resolutions by the PSE Group, the ALDE Group and the left.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution presented by our group together with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group has the following in its favour. The political situation in Uzbekistan is by no means satisfactory. The human rights situation continues to be alarming in many respects. Yet some progress is being made in spite of everything. For example, the first round of the human rights dialogue between the European Union and Uzbekistan took place in Tashkent on 8 and 9 May of this year. Any resolution by the European Parliament must illuminate the current situation, and the present resolution can only be based on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, bearing in mind the Community guidelines on the protection of human rights adopted in 2004, I would like to emphasise the need to improve relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan.

That is what the Uzbek people and human rights activists are asking us to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency derives from the assassinations of journalists and dissidents that have occurred over the last few months, and from the conclusions of the Council on 15 October, which were wrongly presented as a diplomatic victory by President Karimov. The important fact is that the sanctions have been extended for 12 months because no investigation has been carried out into the Andijan massacre and the meetings of experts on the matter have not produced any result.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the lifting of visa bans for six months, we agree that the visa bans should automatically be renewed if the excellent criteria introduced – the visits by United Nations special rapporteurs, for example – are not met within six months.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are not happy with the conclusions on the alleged progress made on human rights. For example, the abolition of the death penalty has still not actually come about, and the EU-Uzbekistan dialogue on human rights is suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this resolution, we condemn the assassination of several independent journalists and dissidents, and demand that serious and impartial investigations are conducted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the intentions of the PPE and the UEN. They are proposing to go further than all the Member States by interpreting the Council’s conclusions not only as a suspension of the visa bans but actually as removal of the visas altogether. Their paragraph 3 states that the ineffectiveness of the sanctions is an encouragement to the Uzbek regime, which makes no sense either intellectually or politically. The text does not even mention the 13 human rights activists whose immediate release President Pöttering demanded by letter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point is that paragraph 9 mentions the difficult situation of Human Rights Watch. That is fine, but the organisation made it known clearly that it did not want to be mentioned in a resolution that was technically incorrect and as harmful for human rights activists as for the Uzbek people and that in the end, as everyone realises, would be used as a propaganda tool by the dictator, President Karimov.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I am asking the MEPs from the PPE and UEN to subscribe to the serious attitude we need to adopt on this matter and with regard to the Uzbek people, and support our motion for a resolution, which says nothing more than the truth about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Karimov’s regime is responsible for the implementation of a policy of terror and corruption in his country, with the victims being, of course, mainly the people of Uzbekistan. These people are subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, to torture and ill-treatment and, while there have been numerous demands for democratic reform, both by the international community and the EU, Mr Karimov carries on taking no notice whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">This reminds me of another individual who is governing his country in a similarly totalitarian manner and takes no notice of those who call for democratic reforms to be implemented. I am talking about King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a country where women have no right to vote, and even no right to drive a car, and where serious human rights abuses are part of everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, sadly, some EU governments are guilty of double standards: they attack Mr Karimov ferociously – and quite rightly so – but are very gentle indeed with King Abdullah. In fact, recently King Abdullah was given an extravagant welcome on state visits to Britain and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The main difference between Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia is money – lots of it – and as long as King Abdullah spends his billions in Britain and Italy, his involvement in gross violations of human rights and democratic institutions in his country can be conveniently overlooked. That, I suppose, is why, when I suggested that the situation in Saudi Arabia be discussed here today, it was turned down ceremoniously by almost all the groups. Perhaps more sensitivity might be shown next time, I hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initial impetus in this direction was nipped in the bud on 13 May 2005, with brute force that claimed the lives of hundreds of demonstrators. Since then, the outside world has remained silent for a conspicuously long time. Little happened initially following our earlier topical and urgent debate on 27 October 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it was not only in better-known states such as Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus that authoritarian regimes took power following the collapse of the Soviet Union; this was particularly also the case in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. There, it was not democracy that had triumphed, but a small group of people who had gained experience in the old state apparatus and the security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Having no objective other than to stay in power, these people turned state enterprises into their own private property, manipulated electoral results, gave the opposition as little leeway as possible, hampered free organisations, restricted the press and, if need be, used violence against their own people. Sadly, this state of affairs persists in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, Europe’s attitude towards Uzbekistan is influenced far too much by economic and military interests. It appears that the dictatorship in Uzbekistan has been allowed to stay on because it proved itself useful in the military intervention in Afghanistan. Such an attitude would completely destroy the credibility of Europe’s pretensions with regard to human rights and democracy. Europe must not make the rights and freedoms of the Uzbeks secondary to other considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU and Central Asian countries, including Uzbekistan, have agreed to make human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democratisation key elements of the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to step up support for the protection of human rights and the creation and development of an independent judiciary, thus making a sustainable contribution to the consolidation of the rule of law and respect for international human rights standards in Central Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">EU-Uzbekistan relations have to be put in this context, where encouragement to take positive steps to improve human rights and democratisation are the basis of dialogue and cooperation. Our relations with Uzbekistan have gone through a difficult phase over the last few years, notably since the events in Andijan in May 2005, and we remain seriously concerned about the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our firm belief that we stand a better chance of encouraging progress in the human rights situation in Uzbekistan by engagement rather than isolation. Isolation has not worked. We welcome the gradual re-engagement that has taken place over the past year, since the EU-Uzbekistan Cooperation Council agreed to establish a regular human rights dialogue, the first round of which was in May this year. Two rounds of expert-level talks have also taken place on the Andijan events. We are also planning a dialogue with Uzbek civil society on freedom of the media, which should take place in Tashkent early next year. We also welcome Uzbekistan’s introduction of habeas corpus and the abolition of the death penalty, which should come into effect in January 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last meeting of the General Affairs Council, the EU Member States agreed on the renewal of restrictive measures but, at the same time, agreed on the conditional suspension of the visa ban. The Council urged Uzbekistan to fully implement its international obligations relating to human rights and, in particular, to allow unimpeded access by relevant international bodies to prisoners, to engage effectively with UN special rapporteurs, to let all NGOs operate without constraint in Uzbekistan and to release human rights defenders from detention and cease harassing them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council stated that the lifting of the visa restrictions would be reviewed after six months, to assess whether Uzbekistan had made progress in meeting these conditions. The Uzbek authorities agreed to continue the discussion on human rights issues in the context of the EU-Uzbekistan Cooperation Committee early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan has also shown itself open to discussing with the Commission ways to further enhance Community assistance in supporting the reform of its political institutions, such as the parliament, and the reform of the judiciary, all of which we will discuss further in the Cooperation Committee. The fact that the EU’s restrictive measures remain in place clearly signals both to the Uzbeks and the broader public our concerns about the situation in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan has a long way to go in the area of human rights and we will continue to stress to the Uzbek side, in line with the Council conclusions, that we expect to see concrete progress in the human rights situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights will continue to be an important and difficult issue in our relations with Uzbekistan, but the Commission believes that engagement is the best way to promote positive developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union absolutely must pursue the policy begun in 2005 after the blind and totally unpunished repression at Andijan, which according to the OSCE and Human Rights Watch left between 500 and 1000 people dead. The many challenges ahead (energy, terrorism, freedoms) mean that Europe must mobilise more than ever on its periphery. Its most pressing mission is to act to promote human rights and to make calm relations with Uzbekistan dependent on progress with fundamental freedoms. The EU cannot ignore the reality of a chimerical rule of law and the hateful assassination last September of the director Mark Weil, known for his opposition to the regime in Tashkent. The Uzbek parliament has recently made several steps towards the abolition of the death penalty and civil justice. Although these decisions are still very inadequate, the European Union’s firmness has not been in vain and runs counter to the principles of an unacceptable and dangerous realpolitik. We need to go even further to achieve democracy and political stability, but we have finally begun to hope. It is up to the vast country of Uzbekistan not to ruin this hope, by building a genuine partnership with Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

They have a long tradition of working in the British Merchant Navy and sending monies back home. During my time in the British Parliament, I was Co-Chairman of the British-Somali All-Party Group. Sometimes we took up problems and sometimes we took up personal issues and so forth. There were many of these. The Somalis were wonderful people but were not served by particularly wonderful leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Now things have gone from bad to worse. We now have a failed state. We have a situation where the country has some of the worst health statistics in the world. Its people face violence every day and continually rising child and maternal mortality rates. They are being caught in the crossfire between Ethiopian and government troops and the court militias. That is why this issue is on the agenda today. We can see how awful it is to live in Somalia today. We can see the glaring necessity to get humanitarian aid there, and yet we cannot get it there. We can see the need for peacekeeping forces, and we welcome what the African Union has promised, but we do not welcome what it is actually providing. It is nothing like what has been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment all we have there is Ugandan troops. Until the promised figure of 8 000 troops is reached, the Ethiopians will not leave. We have to see how we can get people talking – talking across borders, talking across some of our traditional prejudices – because, if people do not talk, there will be no stability, and if there is no stability then there is no future for that country. If there is no future, then more people will die. We will not be responsible, but we will have played no part in preventing that happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, on this point we must not forget, as Mr Bowis was saying, that the enormous level of violence that exists in the country at the moment is primarily fuelled by the continuous entry of arms, mainly light weapons and ammunition, which come from other countries in the region, and in many cases directly from Western countries, which include the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore must not forget that, as well as reacting to the current immediate consequences of what is happening in Somalia, we also have a responsibility for this situation, and when we talk about the obligation and responsibility to protect, which is what we are used to doing in this type of debate, we also need to take our own responsibility for prevention, for example by controlling arms exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU must, as a matter of urgency, bring pressure to bear on all parties to the conflict to commit themselves to an inclusive process of national reconciliation, capable of tackling the political issues at the root of the crisis. The ‘transitional government’ will remain a fiction if it continues to take no action to protect the civilian population and facilitate humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Somalia is more awash with arms than ever, according to a recent UN report. It is essential for countries and dealers who breach the arms embargo imposed in 1992 to be stopped and held accountable. Finally the African Union peacekeeping force urgently needs to be strengthened and the occupying Ethiopian troops need to leave. It should be acknowledged that the Ethiopian intervention, instigated by the Bush administration with the passive complicity of the European Union, did not bring peace or government or even help to combat terrorism in Somalia.

It is generally said that there are three intervention measures that can be taken in such a case: diplomatic pressure, an economic embargo and, if necessary, armed intervention. There is, however, a fourth possibility that we do not mention, and that is that EU countries should start by removing the potential for their own pseudo-business to corrupt bureaucrats in various post-colonial countries, who then set about starting civil wars, often in the basic interests that the pseudo-business is pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something else on the same subject that Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Gomes: surely the weapons used in these countries, including Somalia, are produced in and exported from so-called democratic countries, countries that are economically developed.

Unfortunately, the situation there has not improved and the prolonged destructive civil war has carried on unabated. The resulting tragic human suffering continues, with hundreds of thousands of poverty-stricken refugees, thousands of malnourished and dying children, and the reported emergence in the region of contagious diseases like cholera and hepatitis. That country is in a desperate situation, where anarchy and the law of the jungle prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">In this joint motion for a resolution, as in previous ones, we make a series of useful suggestions, such as the cessation of all foreign military intervention in Somalia – mainly from Ethiopia and Eritrea – and full implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia, which, although imposed 15 years ago, is sadly still to become truly effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We also make a call for protection of freedom of the press by strongly condemning the Somali Government’s systematic harassment of the media and its shameful failure to investigate the killing of journalists whose reporting was deemed to be critical of the government.</p>
<p class="contents">We make these calls conscious of the fact that the chances of them being listened to are very slim indeed. Still, we must persevere in the hope that perhaps common sense and a humanistic attitude will at last prevail and that the Somali people eventually will see more peaceful and prosperous days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only in the north, in the former British colony of Somaliland, does a kind of state exist, but this state is not recognised internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">The place of the state has been taken by a number of warlords, who alternate between fighting and cooperating with each other. The army of neighbouring Ethiopia has appointed itself their joint protector. The Union of Islamic Courts, on the other hand, is their joint adversary and wants to reunite Somalia on the basis of traditional Islamic rules, without the warlords.</p>
<p class="contents">All attempts so far to establish a generally accepted unity government and to help Somalia function again as a state have failed. The Commission’s financial support for the Transitional Federal Institutions that were created in 2004 appeared justified at the time but led to the accusation that the European Union was taking sides in an armed conflict and thus cooperating with Ethiopia against the forces that would prefer to see a strict Islamic regime in power.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a European policy, however well meaning, cannot succeed without the support of the inhabitants of Somalia. For this reason, it is good that the motion for a resolution on which we are soon to vote calls for the cessation of foreign military intervention and for dialogue and reconciliation at domestic level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We consider it very timely to have this wake-up call on Somalia today, since the situation currently poses a significant threat to peace and security, not only in the region but also beyond. It also causes immense suffering for the people of Somalia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Union has taken a lead role in the Somali peace process and the establishment of the transitional federal institutions. We have always strived for a political solution involving all Somali parties, and Commissioner Louis Michel carried out a last-ditch peace mission to rescue the peace process prior to the Ethiopian intervention in December 2006 and has been instrumental in linking EU support to the African Union peace mission to Somalia and to the launch of a genuine National Reconciliation Congress.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an unfolding humanitarian disaster and a diminishing humanitarian space in Somalia, including a crackdown on the independent media and journalists, who are dying in targeted killings. The current levels of humanitarian distress in south and central Somalia have reached alarming proportions. An estimated 1.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 730 000 internally displaced persons, of whom one-third are estimated to be at extreme risk. An estimated 173 000 Mogadishu residents fled the violence in the past two weeks alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to inform you that, in response to the current humanitarian crisis, the Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Office, ECHO, is working with implementing partners to support 1.5 million people, providing the local population, internally displaced people and host communities with access to water, sanitation, nutrition, drugs and support for livestock and livelihoods. This year, it has allocated the highest ever budget for assistance to Somalia, amounting to EUR 20 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very concerned about the evolving security situation in Mogadishu and other regions in south-central Somalia. Insurgency operations appear to be expanding and all parties have significantly increased their military capabilities in the past weeks. The EU is committed to following a multi-pronged approach that entails supporting a comprehensive security strategy, including a ceasefire process and a full deployment of the African Union Mission in Somalia that would facilitate Ethiopian withdrawal, and encouraging the nomination of a representative and effective Prime Minister and government while engaging and providing reassurances to the opposition, to facilitate their involvement during the remainder of the transitional period leading up to elections in 2009.The EU will also urge all parties to respect basic human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to take into account the regional dimensions of the crisis and engage with Ethiopia and Eritrea, which are fighting a proxy war in Somalia, which risks provoking their own border conflict. The Commission has nominated an EC Special Envoy for Somalia and is driving forward proposals for EU action at the General Affairs and External Relations Council. It remains committed to working closely with the European Parliament to stem violence and to find a political solution to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been no functioning government since the overthrow of the Said Barre regime in 1991 which led to anarchy, inter-clan fighting and banditry.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent fighting between the Union of Islamic Courts and allied Ethiopian and Transitional Federal Government troops has displaced at least 100 000 people and famine threatens. Yet the worsening security situation in Mogadishu has prevented international NGOs from coping with this unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the efforts by the African Union to assemble a peacekeeping force to help with national reconciliation, but only 20% of the promised 8 000 have actually been deployed. The African Union must honour its commitments. However, the European Union must in parallel increase its efforts to provide political, financial and logistic support.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community, including the EU, must step up the provision of humanitarian aid to the displaced people. The ultimate solution, however, to restoring Somalia to a functioning state requires the International Somalia Contact Group, including the African Union, the UN, the EU and the US, to engage with actors inside Somalia to support the implementation of the Transitional Federal Charter and Institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>There was a high turnout for the Turkish parliamentary elections. The composition of the new Parliament is more representative of the Turkish population than the previous one and Prime Minister Erdogan’s government has an absolute majority. As the honourable Member states, the government has now had its legitimacy renewed and has a clear mandate, which will allow it to press on resolutely with the reform process.</p>
<p>The European Union has taken – and will continue to take – every opportunity, in particular within the framework of the different political dialogue meetings, to draw the Turkey’s attention to the EU’s expectations that the new government will give reforms a new impetus after the slowdown witnessed over the last year and in the run up to the elections. In that context we would draw attention to the parliamentary majority’s intention to draft a new Constitution – a process that we shall follow closely.</p>
<p>Progress in the reform process, both in terms of adopting new legislation and implementing it, is essential for accession negotiations to move forward and the Union remains ready to help Turkey along that path. Much work lies ahead, especially regarding political criteria. We have pointed out the need for significant progress in areas such as freedom of speech, religious freedom and civil-military relations. Obviously, we view the situation in the southeast of the country with great concern; we roundly condemn all acts of terrorism and we underscore the need for continuing respect for the primacy of law and maintaining regional stability.</p>
<p>In addition, we continue to encourage Turkey to move forward in normalising relations with the Republic of Cyprus and we call for full implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, as mentioned in the EU Declaration of 21 September 2005 in conjunction with the Council conclusions of 11 December 2006. We also urge Turkey to step up its efforts to ensure it fully and unequivocally meets its commitment to maintaining good-neighbourly relations and its commitment to solving any outstanding border disputes in accordance with the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes pursuant to the United Nations Charter, including, if necessary, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Economically, we hope that Turkey will continue on the path of sustainable economic growth whilst simultaneously implementing the structural reform programme.</p>
<p>Summing up, I should like to point out that the Union has drafted a pre-accession strategy providing Turkey with the framework to prepare for accession. The Association Agreement is an important instrument for cooperation between both parties. The Accession Partnership, which is soon to be reviewed, sets priorities for subsequent work and also serves as a reference for tailoring EU assistance to the applicant country’s specific needs. As regards financial assistance, under the new IPA financial instrument, the average annual allocations for Turkey will increase from EUR 497 million in 2007 to EUR 653 million in 2010.</p>
<p>Furthermore, accession negotiations themselves are the most valuable and powerful instrument for generating reform.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0795"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member quite rightly pointed out, the Council, at its 1 October 2007 meeting, reached a political agreement on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services, which is due to be approved through co-decision and thus with Parliament’s full participation.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the agreement is the final deadline of 31 December 2010 for implementation of the amending directive. In this respect, certain Member States (listed in the new Article 3) may be able to extend this deadline to 31 December 2012 at the latest, with the proviso that they notify the Commission beforehand. Further points include clarification and important adjustments that have been made to the relevant definitions, as well as the safeguarding of the universal service, including funding for that service and the authorisation system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the agreement takes account of amendments to the Commission proposal by including a considerable number of amendments suggested in the European Parliament’s opinion in first reading.</p>
<p>Jurist/linguists are putting the final touches to the text of that agreement so that the Council is able to adopt a common position at a forthcoming meeting.</p>
<p>The Council warmly welcomes the excellent cooperation and joint vision it has shared to date with the European Parliament on this crucial subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0797"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question raised by the honourable Member is an interesting one and mirrors one aspect of the broader subject of ‘repatriation of corpses between States’ currently governed by the Strasbourg Convention of 1973, which only some of the Member States have signed and which sets strict rules governing the transfer of corpses. This topic was dealt with in the Commission’s Green Paper on consular protection of European Union citizens, but only in terms of transferring corpses from States outside the European Union.</p>
<p>The question of repatriation of corpses is the responsibility the Member States, which vary in their positions on this issue. Most, if not all, do not have any obligation, or legal possibility for repatriating the corpses of their citizens. The Presidency therefore thinks it is unlikely that a decision will be taken on these matters in the short to medium term, namely in terms of setting up a fund to cover costs which most Member States at least regard as the responsibility of private individuals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0799"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is placing the emphasis on preventing CVD (cardiovascular disease) by dealing with specific health questions affecting the incidence of CVD.</p>
<p>–	Nutrition and physical activity: in 2005 the Council approved Conclusions on promotion of healthy lifestyles and prevention of type 2 diabetes and also approved Conclusions on Health promotion by means of nutrition and physical activity at its meeting of 31 May 2007. It is currently drafting a new set of conclusions on the application of the EU strategy on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues. The High Level Group set up to implement the strategy will discuss cutting the amount of salt in food products as a matter of priority, since salt is a key determining factor in CDV.</p>
<p>–	Smoking: an exchange of opinions took place at the Council meeting of 31 May 2007 on strategic options for a ‘Smoke-free Europe’ policy. Reducing active and passive smoking may result in major progress as far as cardiovascular health is concerned.</p>
<p>–	Alcohol: in November 2006, the Council approved its Conclusions on the EU strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm. Excessive alcohol consumption and the harmful effects which it causes are one of the main priorities of the German, Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies’ programme.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning the European Heart Health Charter, which was drawn up by the European Heart Network and the European Society of Cardiology, with the support of the European Commission and the WHO, and which aims to reduce the impact of cardiovascular disease in the EU and the WHO European Region, as well as decreasing disparities between countries in this area.</p>
<p>Those actions are helping to reduce the main risk factors for contracting CDV set out in the European Parliament’s Resolution of July 2007 and they highlight the importance of prevention through a healthy lifestyle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0803"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Responsibility for negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements on behalf of the EU lies with the Commission, based on the Guidelines approved by the Council in June 2002. Negotiations are normally conducted at regional level. At the level of all the ACP countries, the ACP-EC Council of Ministers is responsible for approving the political guidelines and for taking the necessary decisions to implement the provisions of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, (Article 15 (2) (b)), including those related to the EPAs. In this context, the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 25 May 2007 endorsed a review of the EPA negotiations, as required by Article 37 (4) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p>The ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is not a formal negotiation forum for the EPAs, instead it plays a broader and extremely important role in the Cotonou system. Under the provisions of Article 17 (2) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, its role, as a consultative body, is namely to promote democratic processes through dialogue and consultation and to discuss issues pertaining to development and the ACP-EU Partnership.</p>
<p>The Council of the EU is strongly committed to providing political guidelines on behalf of the EU to the EPA-related process. The Council therefore approved Conclusions in April 2006 and May 2007 underscoring its commitment to the EPAs as development instruments which help to eradicate poverty in ACP States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0806"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not given presented during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member rightly points out, the European Union is a global economic leader in various aspects, in terms of the trade of goods and services, and in the area of internal and external investment. I cannot, however, agree with the honourable Member’s assessment of economic growth and domestic demand in the Union: if the available European Commission forecasts are proved correct, GDP will rise above potential both in 2007 and 2008 and domestic demand will increase even more this year (and will be above that of the United States).</p>
<p>If truth be told, the European Union takes its responsibilities very seriously in terms of solving imbalances in the world economy and hopes that the same is true of its world partners. The EU has been pushing through the economic reforms laid down in the Lisbon Agenda for seven years to try to solve a large number of questions related to both economic demand and the general programme for competitiveness in the global economy. The successful reforms that the Member States have introduced in the context of the Lisbon Agenda are now yielding results and the EU economy is at present in a stronger position to deal with the current period of global economic uncertainty. However, we are not complacent: our structural reform efforts must and will continue, in accordance with the Lisbon Agenda priorities.</p>
<p>As far as the specific question of the euro exchange rate is concerned, I can inform the honourable Member that the Council has not discussed trends in exchange rates as regards the euro or the currencies of Member States not using the euro as their national currency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can inform you that Eurogroup approved and decided to release a statement on exchange rate issues at its meeting on 8 October, reiterating that the ‘Euro area is playing its role for an orderly reduction of the imbalances by implementing structural reforms and contributing to a rebalancing of growth.’</p>
<p>The economic situation and exchange rate developments were also discussed at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting held in Washington on 19 October. The G7 Finance Ministers’ statement included the following paragraph: ‘We affirm that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate. We welcome China's decision to increase the flexibility of its currency, but in view of its rising current account surplus and domestic inflation, we stress its need to allow an accelerated appreciation of its effective exchange rate.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0811"></a>

The international community and all the main stakeholders in the region in particular must support Turkey’s efforts to protect its population and combat terrorism, whilst at the same time respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, maintaining international and regional peace and stability and refraining from taking any disproportionate military action. It is also worth mentioning that the Presidency took part in the Ministerial Conference of the Neighbouring Countries of Iraq, which took place in Istanbul on 2-3 November, where participants voiced their appreciation of the efforts undertaken by the Iraqi government to combat terrorism, including efforts to prevent Iraq from being used as a base for terrorist attacks on its neighbouring countries and recalled the bilateral agreements signed between Iraq and its neighbouring countries with respect to combating terrorism. Reinforcing dialogue and cooperation between the Turkish and Iraqi governments is of the utmost importance in trying to solve this problem.</p>
<p>As an applicant country negotiating for EU accession – and in accordance with the Negotiation Framework – Turkey must undertake to maintain good neighbourly relations and respect the international legal order.</p>
<p>In this context, I can assure the honourable Member that we shall continue to follow the situation very closely and advocate a solution based on cooperation between Turkey and Iraq.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0815"></a>

<p>The Portuguese Presidency has taken the view that fiscal policy needs to make a greater contribution towards improving environmental sustainability. The Presidency is therefore launching a debate on all the initiatives which might promote the efforts undertaken to fight climate change and reach the EU’s objectives for the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in the realisation that fiscal measures can have a positive impact on pollution and consumer behaviour.</p>
<p>With this backdrop in mind, the Portuguese Presidency has intensified discussion of the proposal for a Directive on passenger car related taxes [<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0261">COM(2005)0261</a>] in the Working Party on Tax Questions and has presented a compromise text that gives Member States more flexibility, namely in choosing the environmental performance criteria to be used as a basis for tax differentiation (grams of CO2 per kilometre, fuel consumption or other aspects that may help cut emissions). The Portuguese Presidency instigated a general discussion on this topic in the Council (ECOFIN) on 13 November, the goal being to adopt the proposal for a directive by the end of its mandate, if possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0823"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Once the definitive results from the elections in Sierra Leone were announced on 17 September, the Presidency, on behalf of the EU, congratulated the new President, Ernest Bai Koroma. The Council is looking forward to an improved political dialogue with the new government.</p>
<p>The people of Sierra Leone have shown a laudable strong commitment to democracy throughout the entire electoral process. Sierra Leone’s fundamental institutions and the NEC (National Electoral Commission) in particular, played an important role in the success of the electoral process.</p>
<p>EU aid to Sierra Leone is essentially channelled through the European Development Fund (EDF). The amount allocated to Sierra Leone under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF for programmable aid is EUR 242 million (as opposed to EUR 220 million under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF), plus EUR 26.4 million in non-programmable aid (unforeseen situations). This amount may be reviewed under the mid-term review, based chiefly on the results which the country achieves as compared with the commitments undertaken by its leaders. This new feature of EU cooperation under the EDF will actually make it possible to provide appropriate support to those countries most committed to reforming their governance. We hope that the new leaders of Sierra Leone will help to give a new boost to the country’s development so that they can receive more support.</p>
<p>The EU and several of its Member States also generously support the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Heeding the recent calls of the Special Court on the need to cover its funding for 2008, the Council’s preparatory bodies recently discussed additional support that could be given resulting in new commitments for the 2008 budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0827"></a>

<p>The EU has decided to send out a clear signal to the international community on its determination to fight climate change and its commitment to starting negotiations on a global post-Kyoto agreement for the post 2012 period.</p>
<p>Climate change has systematically featured on the EU’s diplomatic agenda and last year it played a prominent role at various summits and meetings between the EU and third countries, including the USA.</p>
<p>The most recent EU-USA summit on 30 April 2007 approved a joint statement on energy security and climate change which underlines our mutual interest in ensuring secure, affordable, and clean supplies of energy and tackling climate change with the ultimate objective being to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The EU and the USA held a High Level Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development in Helsinki on 24 and 25 October 2006 on using existing initiatives as a basis for progressing with the Gleneagles G8 Action Plan. The third ministerial meeting of the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development took place in Berlin on 9-11 September 2007 and was attended by representatives from 20 countries with high energy needs, including the USA, to discuss innovative ideas so as to develop an integrated energy and climate change policy outlook.</p>
<p>The G8 process begun at Gleneagles yielded an important result in Heiligendamm this year: recognition by all G8 parties that the UN climate process is the appropriate body for negotiating global action on climate change. Also in the scope of the G8, it is worth mentioning the Special Meeting of Sherpas (technical advisors) on Climate Change (Berlin, 16 October 2007).</p>
<p>Another event which also offered an opportunity to move forward work in the area of cooperation in bilateral EU-USA meetings was the High Level Event on Climate Change hosted by the United Nations’ Secretary General (New York, 24 September 2007).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0829"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The 7th RDT Framework Programme is anchored on the premise that regions are among the most important stakeholders in innovation and research policy.</p>
<p>Under the ‘Capacities’ Specific Programme, EUR 126 million is allocated specifically to the ‘Regions of Knowledge’ initiative, in addition to a further EUR 340 million earmarked for the ‘Research Potential’ initiative, which is specifically geared around the European Union’s convergence and outermost regions.</p>
<p>In theory, the aforementioned initiatives (which are targeted on the regions) are due to run throughout the entire Framework Programme. A mid-term review is planned for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> FP, which will be carried out during the programme. This might possibly then have some impact on certain aspects of the programme. Nevertheless, it is most likely that the initiatives aimed more specifically at the regions will continue.</p>
<p>Of further note are the ‘ERANet’ projects under the ‘Cooperation’ Specific Programme, which are worth mentioning with regard to the regional dimension, given that one of the priorities of the corresponding mechanism consists of supporting the creation of networks between regional (and national) public S&amp;T programmes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Europe’s regions in general (and the outermost regions in particular) should have the benefit of funding initiatives under the Seventh Research and Technological Development Framework Programme until 2013.</p>
<p>Moreover, it will probably be possible to achieve greater synergy between the RTD Framework Programme and Structural Fund-related programmes for European regions, chiefly by allowing the regional bodies to take part in the FP and making it possible forthe European regions to develop at local level the results obtained by participating in projects covered by the Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0832"></a>

<p>Yang Chunlin, a Chinese activist campaigning for land rights, has been tortured in a Chinese prison. According to his sister, Yan Chunping, the activist spent days at the prison chained up in the same position and was forced to clear up other prisoners' excrement. The reason for his arrest was a petition which he had organised against the Olympic Games. He collected more than 10 000 signatures, mainly from expropriated farmers, under the slogan, 'We don't want the Olympic Games, we want human rights'. Illegal expropriation of land is commonplace in China. One and a half million people are said to have been forced to leave their homes to make way for the new sports complexes.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought that holding the Olympic Games in China would have a positive effect, because the event would present an opportunity to expose China more to external influences. Now, however, it is felt that a boycott of the Olympic Games is the only remaining instrument available to Europe to bring pressure to bear on China. Is the Council considering boycotting the Games in order to make it clear to China that serious violations of human rights are unacceptable?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or on the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In accordance with the EU guidelines on human rights defenders, the EU Heads of Mission in Beijing are following the situation of human rights defenders closely, including that of Yang Chunlin, and the Council regularly raises individual disturbing cases with the Chinese authorities through different channels.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities were also given a list of individual cases before the last talks held in Beijing on 17 October. At that meeting, the EU voiced its concern at the harassment and ongoing imprisonment inflicted on human rights defenders. The EU regretted the increasing surveillance and control of the media, including via the Internet, and defended freedom of expression. It also raised the question of torture. As has happened in previous dialogues, the EU called on China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China signed nine years ago and which enshrines and protects citizens’ rights and offers them protection against abuse.</p>
<p>In its human rights dialogue with China, the EU regularly raises many of the claims set out in the open letter entitled: ‘Human rights wanted, not Olympic Games’ which formed the subject of Yang Chunlin’s campaign. During the last round of talks, the items broached included the following questions: giving national journalists the same access and independence as foreign journalists, protecting Chinese workers’ rights on construction sites and ending discrimination against migrant workers. The Council is also concerned with the removal and forced relocation of people due to urban development whether or not in relation to the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Council agrees with the honourable Member that the human rights situation in China continues to give cause for concern. However, some modest progress has been seen in some areas, for example the reduction in the number of executions following the reviewing of death sentences by the Supreme People’s Court, fewer restrictions on the foreign media since 1 January 2007 and promulgation of the new labour contract law.</p>
<p>The Council therefore believes that it is worthwhile continuing the dialogue with China on these subjects, even if the results are not always quantifiable after each round of talks and do in fact move only gradually.</p>
<p>As regards human rights and the Olympic Games, China has undertaken a series of commitments in this area as part of its bid to host the Olympics in 2008. The Council will thus monitor the situation closely and raise any questions that cause concern. As for the possibility of boycotting the games, it is not up to the Council of the EU to take a decision (as this is a question for each IOC Member State to decide).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0836"></a>

<p>The Reform Treaty was adopted at the European Council meeting of 18-19 October, and it is to be signed on 13 December in Lisbon. The agreement that was reached will make it possible to put an end to six years of discussions on institutional reform and to concentrate on tackling the EU’s main tasks. As the experience with the EU Constitutional Treaty showed, however, the Reform Treaty still has to negotiate a difficult passage before it is ratified in the 27 Member States. According to sociological research, about 60% of the Constitutional Treaty’s opponents in France gave as one of their reasons that the text of the Treaty was very complicated and difficult to understand. In comparison with the Reform Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty was significantly shorter and easy to understand. This gives rise to doubts as to whether the Member States will be able sufficiently to explain the content and meaning of the new Treaty to their citizens.</p>

<p>The Commission recently presented its proposals on a future ‘integrated maritime policy’ at EU level.

Following the refusal of the party leadership to comply with the order to cancel the congress, the President of the Court indicated the party chairman Gyula Thurmer and six members of the executive for contempt with the possibility of a two-year prison sentence.

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or on the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of normalising bilateral relations between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus is being followed closely and dealt with at the appropriate levels. Ratification and subsequent implementation of the Adaptation Protocol of the Ankara Agreement on the accession of the ten new Member States of the EU is an obligation which Turkey has undertaken but has still not fulfilled. Much attention has been given to that question, for instance at the meeting of the EU-Turkey Political Directors’ Troika held in Lisbon on 18 September. The question will also be dealt with at the next meeting of the Ministerial EU-Turkey meeting, which is being held in Brussels on 20 November. Moreover, the Council regularly asks Turkey to change its policy with regard to the Republic of Cyprus’ participation in international organisations and forums.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council will analyse the situation on the basis of the progress report published by the Commission on 6 November. Pursuant to the Council conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council will analyse the questions covered by the EU Declaration of 21 September 2005. Full implementation of the Protocol is also a short-term priority under the Accession Partnership, which will be reviewed over the course of this year. Turkey’s fulfilment of its obligations to the EU and the Accession Partnership priorities will affect the negotiating process.</p>
<p>As regards the situation in Cyprus, the Union is still committed to contributing towards a resolution of the Cyprus problem in the scope of the UN that is inclusive, viable and compatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded. In this regard, we support the rapid implementation of the agreement reached on 8 July 2006 under the aegis of the UN and we are still eagerly awaiting the start of the technical committees and expert groups’ work on the in-depth issues.</p>
<p>I can assure the honourable Member that the Presidency and the Union will continue to support the efforts made in this regard.</p>
<p>Let me also state that the Union is still committed to contributing towards a resolution of the Cyprus problem in the scope of the UN that is inclusive, viable and compatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded.

<p>The EU considers this question first and foremost as coming under the scope of bilateral relations between the USA and Cuba. Nevertheless, as was the case last year, the EU voted in favour of Resolution 61 of the United Nations’ General Assembly on the need to end the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the USA. The Council adopted Regulation (EC) 2271 protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom and joint action based on Articles J.3 and K.3 of the TEU on measures protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom. The EU continues to call for the Helms-Burton legislation to be repealed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council conclusions on EU policy vis-à-vis Cuba, of 18 June 2007, state that: ‘the EU recognizes the right of the Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future and remains ready to contribute positively to the future development of all sectors of Cuban society, including through development cooperation instruments.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0828"></a>

<p>The Commission is contributing to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of universal primary education, this through a mix of instruments. This is clearly upheld by the MDG focus of the European Consensus and the Africa Strategy.</p>
<p>In its bilateral cooperation, the European Commission currently supports developing countries' efforts in the field of education through over 400 bilateral and regional ongoing projects in almost 100 countries. In 2006, the EC allocated €517 million for the education component of its development policy and external assistance: 43% to basic education, 15% to secondary education, 24% to post secondary, and 18% specifically to institutional support.</p>
<p>In addition to support through projects, the Commission provides general budget support to 28 countries from the 9th European Development Fund. This instrument is important because it helps to pay for salaries and other running costs covered by the budgets of the governments of those countries. About 30% of the funds going to these 28 countries is planned to be provided in this way. The Commission gives crucial support to education through this instrument, which provides a strong financial incentive to implement sound policies in the social sectors since part of the disbursement of general budget support is linked to indicators that contribute to the achievements of the MDG.</p>
<p>In line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Harmonisation, the Commission intends to increase the share of its programmable bilateral development aid channelled through budget support –be it sector or general one– to 50% if possible.</p>
<p>A purely accounting approach to development aid based on sector allocations is not really complete. For example in Rwanda budget support is delivered by a coordinated group of donors engaged in a permanent sector dialogue with the authorities. The results are visible as public spending has successfully been reallocated to social sectors (while reducing military expenses). Between 1998 and 2004 social spending grew from 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product to 7.5%. Specific operations allowed school fees to be eliminated, with a corresponding upsurge in the primary enrolment ratio which rose to 93%.</p>
<p>As for the new programming cycle, an estimated €1.8 billion is programmed for education from the EC budget and the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (all regions). The Commission is improving the ways to link funding commitments to MDG progress. The MDG Contract is an enhanced form of General Budget Support with outcome indicators linked to education and other MDG relevant sectors. The aim is to have a longer term predictability where the support to education will not be undermined by the “stop and go” dynamics which have often characterised the disbursement of budget support.</p>
<p>Finally, the thematic programme "Investing in People" will also provide additional assistance to developing countries in cases where regular channels of financial support are not sufficient. Such additional support will be used to accelerate progress towards the core Education for All goal of Universal Primary School Completion (UPC) through a financial contribution to the Fast Track Initiative (FTI).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0845"></a>

<p>A number of reports have recently been coming in from NGOs operating in Myanmar concerning widespread poverty and warning that the situation is likely to get worse in view of the increase in oil prices, the lack of welfare services and public spending curbs in the health and education sectors. They also consider international aid programmes to be too limited and inadequate to the task. The meeting of the Council of Ministers for General Affairs and External Relations of 15 and 16 October 2007 concluded that a substantial programme of humanitarian aid for Myanmar was necessary and announced that the EU was ready to step up aid subject to an assessment of the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p>What is the level of European presence in the country and what action is it taking in cooperation with the populace, local organisations and international bodies? Has the Commission been given an appraisal of the current humanitarian situation and the possible impact of an international embargo? Does it intend to take further measures and initiatives on the humanitarian and diplomatic fronts?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of humanitarian organisations about the general vulnerability of the Burmese population, which has only deteriorated over the last few years. In view of this development, the Commission has responded by constantly increasing its humanitarian aid in the last few years. In 1997, less than EUR 4 million per year was dedicated to the Burmese crisis – this covered not only aid for the populations living inside the country but also aid for Burmese refugees housed in camps in neighbouring countries. In 2007, the programmes under way reached EUR 15.5 million.</p>
<p>The sectors for priority action in Burma are protection, basic healthcare, water and sanitation, food aid and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children. In the refugee camps in Thailand – there are approximately 150 000 of these – the Commission’s support covers basic needs: food, healthcare, and access to drinking water and sanitation. These actions are implemented by the agencies of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and partner non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that further support of EUR 1 million for the World Food Programme (WFP) has just been approved, and that its services are currently preparing a new programme worth EUR 18 million covering the end of 2007 and the whole of 2008, to meet the need for protection, basic healthcare, water and sanitation of the most vulnerable Burmese populations, particularly ethnic minorities, and the needs of Burmese refugees in Thailand.</p>
<p>This humanitarian aid will be supplemented by the budget line on aid for uprooted people, providing EUR 16 million for the period 2007 to 2010 for Myanmar and Thailand, and from 2008 by the new Food Security Thematic Programme, which has been given EUR 16 million for Myanmar alone.</p>
<p>In addition to humanitarian aid in the strict sense, the Commission has also developed programmes to fight poverty. For the first time in 2007, a multiannual indicative programme (2007-2010) has been adopted for the benefit of the people of Burma. This programme is worth EUR 32 million and will be used to support the activities of the Three Disease Fund, which aims to fight the ravages of tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in Myanmar. The other sector of intervention of the programme will be basic education, through UNICEF’s Education For All programme<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on several occasions the Commission has expressed its concern, both publicly and through discreet diplomacy, about the reduction of the humanitarian space in Myanmar – such as the ICRC’s difficulty with fulfilling its mandate in Myanmar, especially with visiting those in detention and visiting conflict areas in the east. The restrictions on work and conditions of access for humanitarian aid workers in Myanmar are also a major obstacle to increasing the aid programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will persist with its efforts at persuasion of the Burmese authorities and will continue its humanitarian aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2001 at the African Summit on HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases in Abuja, Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity pledged indeed to set a target of allocating at least 15% of their annual budget to the improvement of the health sector.</p>
<p>In his question the Honourable Member suggests that six years later, the vast majority of countries are investing a far smaller percentage of their budgets on health. However, the picture is not quite as black. The World Health Organisation Regional Committee for Africa reported in August 2007 that half of the countries of the region are now allocating between 10% and 15% of their national budget to health. Furthermore, ten countries of the Region have been able to raise their health spending to between 30 and 40 US dollars per capita.</p>
<p>The Commission supported the original Abuja Declaration and has continued to engage African governments – ministries of finance and health - through policy dialogue on various development issue including health and health expenditure. The Commission continues to pursue this dialogue but the decision about resource allocations must be made by the partner countries and cannot be made in Brussels.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago (24-26 October 2007) the Commission was involved in the first African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States' Health Ministers' Meeting that took place in Brussels and where over 40 ministers of health discussed the challenges of ACP progress towards the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The issues of financing and management of health systems have been key areas of concern and discussion. The declaration from this meeting has recommitted once again to progress on the Abuja Declaration.</p>
<p>The policy dialogue with partner countries in Africa is underpinned by the work on aid effectiveness and aid predictability. The Commission has been the driving force behind the adoption of EU's new development policy, which reflects European ambition to make a decisive contribution to the achievement of MDGs through delivery of better coordinated Official Development Assistance in a less volatile and unpredictable manner.</p>
<p>Performance based budget support, which strengthens the overall ability of partner countries to develop and execute their development plans, is an important step in this respect. Under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF) two thirds of the countries which received budget support had performance targets linked to health sector financing improvements. Under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, some 40% of programmable aid, at national level, will be through budget support, part of which will be linked to outcomes and budgetary performance in health sector.</p>
<p>But even budget support, does not always allow for substantial fiscal space that countries need to have to finance high recurrent costs in health. Unless the Commission provides long-term, predictable and coordinated support, it will not be able to give partner countries sufficient opportunity to strengthen their health systems, ensure predictable numbers of health workers and deliver health programmes that are key for the achievement of health MDGs.</p>
<p>This is the reason why under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF a new modality of budget support – the MDG Contract – will also be introduced which will provide longer term (six years) and more predictable aid, with a focus on results as a mean to improve effectiveness of budget support in accelerating progress towards the MDGs.</p>
<p>The 20% benchmark that the Honourable Member refers to is an undertaking by the Commission to dedicate by 2009, 20% of spending under the Development Cooperation Instrument to "basic and secondary education and basic health, through project, programme or budget support linked to these sectors, taking an average across all geographical areas under this instrument."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Manifestly, the Honourable Member’s question relates to the consequences of the closure, at the end of 2006, of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian government took the decision to close these units eight years ago, in 1999. This decision was based on the absolutely overriding consideration of nuclear safety, and is in line with Bulgaria's obligation under the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>It was known that this would have consequences.</p>
<p>The EU has provided very substantial financial assistance not only for decommissioning, but also to mitigate the consequences of the closure. €550 million has been put in as grants, mainly via the Kozloduy Decommissioning Support Fund managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Half of this sum should finance projects leading to substantial energy savings, including the improvement of lignite-fired power plants such as Pernik. Moreover, there is a €212.5 million Euratom loan for the modernisation of units 5 and 6 of Kozloduy, which consequently operate at a higher utilisation rate of power capacity. According to conservative estimates provided by the EBRD, the combined effect of the energy savings the Commission is financing will exceed the loss of supply from Kozloduy units 3 and 4.</p>
<p>But the security of electricity supply also requires better interconnections between countries. This is primarily a matter of Transmission System Operators working together. In addition, in the Balkan region, there is a structural problem of underinvestment in generation capacity. Considering the importance of the needs it is necessary to attract private investment. For that reason, the Commission is strongly supporting the full implementation of the Energy Community Treaty providing a common legislative and regulatory framework in the region. Market integration and clear market rules are indeed a key precondition for investments in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0819"></a>

<p>The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as Western Balkan states participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), have been given the perspective of eventual EU membership. Before joining the EU, the two countries will need to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria and the conditions established within the framework of the SAP.</p>
<p>In its 2005 Strategy Paper, the Commission outlined the consecutive steps for the Western Balkan countries on their way towards the EU. The Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) aiming to prepare the countries for the future EU membership mark an important point on this road. A satisfactory track record in implementing the SAA obligations will be an essential element for the EU to consider any membership application.</p>
<p>As regards the time frame of the integration process of the two countries with the EU, the European Council stated in December 2006 that the Union would refrain from setting any target dates for accession until the accession negotiations were close to completion.</p>
<p>The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia applied for membership in 2004 and was given status of the candidate country in December 2005. The Commission will be in a position to recommend the opening of accession negotiations once the country has met all the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>In particular, before accession negotiations can be opened, the country will need to achieve concrete progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria and in the effective implementation of the SAA. The political criteria must be met and significant progress towards meeting the economic criteria and the obligations of membership must have been achieved.</p>
<p>In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the technical negotiations on the SAA were finalised in December 2006. In May 2007, the Member States endorsed the outcome of the negotiations, but reiterated that to conclude the SAA, Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to meet the four key conditions set out by the EU in October 2005: i) police reform; ii) full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY); iii) reform of public broadcasting; and vi) public administration reform. The progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina up to date has not allowed for concluding the SAA. The conclusion of the SAA is a prerequisite for further approximation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0856"></a>

<p>The United Kingdom has recently signed an agreement with Turkey known as the 'Turkey United Kingdom Strategic Partnership for 2007/2008', which is distinctly dichotomous in nature, since it constantly refers to provisions and principles recognising as a fait accompli the occupation of 37% of the Cypriot Republic by the Turkish military, in flagrant violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 541/83 of 18 November 1983 and 550/84 of 11 May 1984, condemning the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' as illegal and secessionist and calling on all governments to refuse to recognise any Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. At the same time, it has been reported that this agreement effectively sacrifices the interest of Cyprus to those of Turkey and has been agreed by the United Kingdom in exchange for Turkey refraining from incursions into Iraq.</p>

Following the enlargement to incorporate the countries of Eastern Europe, public debates were instead dominated by warnings that labour markets would be overrun by migrant workers from the new Member States. As regards the EU membership prospects for the countries of the Western Balkans, the objectives of European enlargement have never been explained to the public, the result being a striking lack of awareness of the issues at stake and a dramatic loss of support for the EU's enlargement policy.

<p>The Commission regrets the negative attitude concerning the EU's Enlargement policy which seems to prevail in a number of Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly stressed the importance of better communication and the need to tackle myths with facts. It is essential to raise awareness about both, the challenges as well as benefits of Enlargement policy.</p>
<p>However, it is a fact that the Commission cannot on its own bring about a change of public perception, but that all institutions of the European Union have to play their part. Much more needs to be done in this respect by the Member States, themselves, be it at national, regional or local level.</p>
<p>The Commission is of course ready to support their efforts by making available factual information, and by creating synergies with the EU institutions and interested Member States. It has in this respect, increased its activities for which the following examples may offer an illustration:</p>
<p>On the occasion of the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> anniversary of the 2004 Enlargement, a number of specific web pages were published with illustrations of the positive impact of the last enlargement.</p>
<p>A brochure on Enlargement policy for the general public is about to be published in all official languages.</p>
<p>Organisation of a number of events involving in particular young people.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue of free movement of workers from the new to old Member States (explicitly addressed in the question), the Commission has published a report on the issue.</p>
<p>Enlargement led to a gradual implementation of the free movement of workers within the EU. Those Member States which immediately opened their labour market to new ones benefited in various ways: migrants helped fill vacancies and jobs moved from the grey to the white sector. Building on this positive experience, a number of other Member States are moving towards the full free movement of workers. Fears of a tidal wave of labour migrants from the new Member States disturbing seriously the labour markets of old Member States have not materialized.</p>
<p>For 2008, projects informing on the impact of enlargement will be continued and complemented by communication activities aimed at providing a platform for networking between Civil Society actors in Member States and candidates and potential candidate countries.</p>
<p>Increasing public support for future enlargements to the countries in Southeast Europe will require a concerted effort. In the Commission's opinion, it will in particular be necessary to provide factual information about the considerable benefits of the 5<span class="sup">th</span> enlargement.</p>
<p>The Commission appeals to all actors to help provide information and support efforts to better communicate, not least does it welcome support from Members of the Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0810"></a>

<p>The Commission has taken note of the recommendations in the resolution adopted by Parliament on 21 June 2007, on the basis of the report by the honourable Member on juvenile delinquency.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that all the stakeholders – mainly those from civil society and the local and national authorities – need to step up their efforts to prevent and combat the causes that set young people on the road to delinquency and to reduce the effects of their social marginalisation.</p>
<p>The Commission fully supports the multidimensional approach to preventing and repressing juvenile delinquency. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation between all the public and private services with responsibilities in the field of training, education, employment and social integration, focusing particularly on preventive measures. Facilitating the exchange of information and best practices should be a cornerstone of the European Union’s action, possibly leading to the development of models for intervention or minimum guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to support cooperation between different local and national bodies through financial instruments with various different objectives. Given the cross-cutting nature of the causes of juvenile delinquency and its treatment, it does not seem appropriate to develop a single financial support programme. The diversity of public policies likely to prevent the desocialisation and marginalisation of young people demands different types of financial support from the Community.</p>
<p>A major study is currently being conducted on juvenile crime and statistical data will be collected on criminal justice, on the basis of reliable and comparable indicators.

<p>The process of the Schengen evaluation in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia before the lifting of controls at internal borders has been accomplished. Although experts of the Commission participate in the evaluation visits, it should be underlined that this evaluation process is carried out under the responsibility of the Council.</p>
<p>The evaluation process of the state of preparations in the Member States concerned started in 2006. Since then, a number of visits to verify the correct application of the Schengen acquis at external borders (but also to consulates, police stations and data protection authorities) of the concerned Member States took place.</p>
<p>As a result of this two-year long process of evaluations and verifications, it has become evident that the Member States concerned have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply the whole Schengen acquis. There are no remaining difficulties or problems with the control of the land borders with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Serbia and Croatia.</p>
<p>Parliament is consulted on the draft Council decision confirming this positive evaluation and determining the date for the lifting of border controls at the borders with and between these new Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0847"></a>

<p>The final draft framework decision by the EU Ministers for Home Affairs and Justice legally endorses a new era of 'biometric' monitoring of individual beliefs and convictions. This involves increased immunity for the secret services and facilitates on 'pre-emptive' grounds also, the more widespread processing and exchange of sensitive personal data with any interested third parties, be they governments, international organisations or private bodies, together with exchanges of information regarding suspects for the prevention, investigation or penalisation of criminal acts. Such information covers not only political and trade union activity but also extends to personal data concerning health, religious and philosophical beliefs and ethnicity for the ostensible purpose of averting a potential threat to public safety within a Member State but also for scientific and statistical purposes.</p>

<p>The Commission's proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has not yet been adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision does not regulate the biometric monitoring of individual beliefs and convictions. Article 7 of the draft Council Framework Decision regulates the processing of special categories of data: sensitive personal data. Personal data reveiling racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religous or philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership and data concerning health or sex life are considered as special categories of data. The processing of special categories of data shall be permitted only when this is strictly necessary and when domestic law provides adequate safeguards. The Commission is of the opinion that this does not contribute to more widespread processing and exchange of sensitive personal data. The European Data Protection Supervisor has signalled that he is satisfied with the current wording of Article 7.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision provides a clear set of rules on the processing of personal data between Member States. In addition, it clearly regulates the transfer or making available of personal data received from another Member State to a third State or international body. Finally, the Framework Decision regulates the transmission of personal data received from or made available by the competent authority of another Member State to private parties in Member States.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision does not allow onward processing of personal data to any interested party. The purposes allowing onward processing of personal data for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties are well set out in detail in the Framework Decision. Regarding the averting of a potential threat to public security, the draft Council Framework Decision does allow the onward processing of personal data in the interest of the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security insofar as this is not incompatible with the purpose for which the data were collected. The competent authorities are only authorised to process such data in accordance with the legal provisions applicable and the processing is necessary and proportionate to that purpose. As regards the processing of personal data for scientific and statistical purposes, the draft Council Framework Decision provides that the competent authorities may further process the transmitted data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, provided that Member States provide appropriate safeguards, such as, for example, making the data anonymous.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission does not think that the draft Council Framework Decision infringes the protection of personal data or democratic rights. Since the Framework Decision only provides a minimum set of data protection requirements, the Commission is of the opinion that the evaluation of the national measures taken to ensure full compliance with the Framework Decision, which is foreseen in Article 27 of the draft Council Framework Decision should be used to examine whether the level of data protection could be increased.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0867"></a>

<p>The European Community has recently joined the Hague Conference on International Private Law. The Member States need Community authorisation to accede to a range of international civil-law arrangements. The European Commission has submitted a number of proposals to the Council for signature or ratification. In the case of some conventions, the decisions have been pending for several years. Some conventions are operational exclusively between those Member States that managed to ratify them prior to their accession to the Union.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider it a good policy to refuse European citizens the benefits of modern conventions, frequently negotiated at the request of, and with active participation by, the Member States, as well as Commission, to distance Europe from global instruments of cooperation, and to delay such moves ad infinitum? Does the Commission consider Community accession to the Hague Conference compatible with the virtual standstill on accession to instruments developed by its members? Does the Commission believe that the EU can be viewed as a reliable partner by others in international negotiations if it is unable, for several years, to make up its mind and decide on a course of action? Is the Commission planning to take any steps to resolve this problem?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission understands that the Honorouble Member is referring to international conventions the ratification of which is pending for reasons relating to the dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar and does not refer to the accession to the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities held with an Intermediary where the Council is substantially divided as to the desirability of a ratification, since the Parliament itself, in a resolution adopted on 14 December 2006, urged the Council not to sign this Convention until a comprehensive impact study had established that such accession would not create distortions in the internal market in financial services.</p>
<p>As already set out in reply to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-2576_EN.html">E-2576/07</a>, the Commission fully shares the concern that that the differences between Spain and the United Kingdom over Gibraltar are currently blocking the accession of the Community to several important conventions, namely:</p>
<p>- 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (Hague Convention on child protection);</p>
<p>- 2001 Unidroit Cape Town Convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the Protocol thereto on Matters specific to Aircraft Equipment;</p>
<p>- 2002 International Maritime Organisation Protocol to the Athens Convention relating to the Transport of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea;</p>
<p>- 2003 United Nations Protocol on Civil liability for Damage and Compensation for Damage caused by Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters;</p>
<p>- 2003 Council of Europe Convention on Contact with Children.</p>
<p>Since these Conventions fall, wholly or partly, under exclusive Community competence, Member States are not allowed to ratify them without having been authorised by the Community to do so. Consequently, the bilateral problem between Spain and the United Kingdom indeed prevents all other Member States from ratifying these Conventions.</p>
<p>As the list shows, this problem does not only concern conventions adopted in the framework of the Hague Conference on Private International Law but also other international organisations such as UNIDROIT and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The Commission has already undertaken considerable efforts to remedy that situation. Concerning, in particular, the Hague Convention on Child Protection, the Commission has written to the Member States concerned several times since 2005, urging them to unblock the situation which is becoming increasingly unacceptable for the other Member States keen on ratifying this valuable convention. The issue also was raised at a number of JHA<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Councils directly with the Ministers concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission has been assured by the two Member States concerned that negotiations on this issue are ongoing and that a resolution of the problem is expected in the near future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The purpose of the Strategic Guidelines is to provide guidelines for programming the EU funds in the Member States.

<p>As far as the allocations to the Member States for each of the four Funds are concerned, the Commission transmitted to the Member States, in July 2007, the final allocations on the budget year 2007 and the provisional ones for the budget year 2008.</p>
<p>90% to 93% of the amounts of the Funds must be implemented under shared management. Therefore, it is now up to the Member States to involve regional and local bodies, as well as non governmental organisations in the process of elaboration and implementation of their multi-annual and annual programmes.</p>
<p>En effet, les décisions créant les Fonds prévoient explicitement que les Etats membres sont responsables de la sélection et la mise en œuvre des projets cofinancés, dans le respect des grands objectifs européens de programmation. C'est au niveau national et local que les besoins prioritaires spécifiques liés à la politique d'asile, d'intégration, de la gestion des retours et des frontières extérieures peuvent être le mieux défini.</p>
<p>As far as the shares of the Funds to be implemented directly by the Commission as "Community actions" are concerned, calls for proposals will be published on a regular basis.

In acting this way, the Commission would be responsible for the serious tensions which would certainly come about between countries of the same region that were treated differently, in a spirit which would be quite contrary to the objective of regional integration, depending on whether or not they had signed such agreements.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to prevent such agreements from being directly damaging to the countries that do not sign them? How can the Commission explain this new position, in view of the priority it has always given to regional integration as an argument for the signing of EPAs?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Based on the Cotonou Agreement and its objectives of sustainable development, regional integration and enhanced participation of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in the multilateral trading system, the EC has been conducting Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations with the ACP Group of States and ACP regions since 2002. These negotiations are now in their final phase ahead of the end of 2007 deadline when the current Cotonou preferences and the World Trade Organisation waiver protecting them expire. The 2007 joint ACP-EC review of EPA negotiations reaffirmed the parties' commitment to meeting the deadline.</p>
<p>The EC's objective remains to replace the current Cotonou trade regime by full, comprehensive EPAs covering issues relating to trade in goods as well as services, investment and trade-related areas important for ACP development with a view to establishing effective regional markets and special relationships between these regions and the EU. At the same time, progress across the EPA negotiations has been uneven. Where a full EPA cannot be completed on time, the parties have to capture those issues negotiated so far in an agreement with a good market access arrangement at its core and then move on to finalise negotiations in other areas in the early part of 2008. This will help avoid trade disruption without compromising the objective of negotiating comprehensive EPAs with a full development package.</p>
<p>Similarly, where only certain countries within a region wish to proceed with negotiations, the Commission is prepared to work on this basis, in order to reach agreements on market access as a step towards full EPAs. To maintain the momentum of ongoing regional integration plans any such agreement will be a stepping stone to a full EPA open to all countries of the region in question.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that at present there is no alternative to this pragmatic approach, set out in its Communication of 23 October 2007, and it will continue to pursue development objectives rather than EU offensive interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0785"></a>

<p>The European Security Strategy states that: ‘The post Cold War environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and external aspects of security are indissolubly linked’. EU intervention has covered both the internal and external aspects of the threats identified by the European Security Strategy, particularly through the 2005 European Anti-Terrorism Strategy from an internal point of view and through international cooperation and assistance with strategic partners in third countries. As regards the fight against organised crime, the European Union is pushing for the ratification of the international agreements that constitute the frame of reference for our assistance in third countries. Europol is supplying annual reports and statistics that are helping to improve information and knowledge about the areas in question.</p>
<p>The implementation of the European Security Strategy is more effective when EU and Community instruments work towards the same objectives. The Commission has been trying to achieve this by taking account of the external aspects of internal policies as well. This will become easier with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which removes the current division between the first and third pillars, introduces the codecision procedure and increases the role of Parliament.</p>
<p>Actions under the CFSP<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the ESDP<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> will continue to take account of external threats in parallel with Community action outside the EU and internal measures in the area of freedom, justice and security.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission believes its internal and external policy objectives are more than ever intertwined, demanding a renewed vision of the way in which the EU’s interests and values, obviously including the security of its citizens, are planned, promoted and protected.</p>
<p>All our instruments are working together to deal with the challenges highlighted in the European Security Strategy: our enlargement policy, which extends peace, stability, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law across Europe; our neighbourhood policy, which aims to build relations based on shared interests and values with neighbouring countries; our trade policy, our development and humanitarian aid policy, and our action on climate change and energy security.</p>
<p>Any revision of the European Security Strategy should take account of these new global challenges and incorporate all the responses to them at European level, regardless of institutional considerations, as the Commission stated in its 2006 Communication ‘Europe in the World – Some Practical Proposals for Greater Coherence, Effectiveness and Visibility’<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's internal market proposals adopted on 19 September 2007, the package and, more specifically, the proposal for more effective unbundling apply in the same manner to publicly and privately owned companies. This means that irrespective of its public or private nature, no person or group of persons would be able alone or jointly to influence the composition of the boards, the voting or decision making of transmission system operators and at the same time the supply or production companies. This ensures that where supply or production activities are in public ownership, the independence of a publicly owned transmission system operator is still guaranteed; but these proposals do not require state owned companies to sell their network to a privately owned company. For instance, to comply with this requirement, any public entity or the State could transfer the rights (which provide the “influence”) to another publicly or privately owned legal person.</p>
<p>The important issue is that in all cases where unbundling is carried out, the Member State in question must demonstrate that in practice, the results are truly effective and that the companies operate entirely separate from one another, providing a real level-playing field across the whole of the EU. Moreover, the Commission's proposals oblige Member States to guarantee the independence of the regulatory authority by ensuring that the regulatory authority is legally distinct and functionally independent from any other public or private entity.</p>
<p>These provisions should ensure that irrespective of the ownership of transmission system operators or supply companies, all market players should be faced with the same level playing field and should receive an equal treatment from the regulatory authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0812"></a>

<p>In Mexico 2004, Mr Ulises Ruiz Ortiz succeeded in becoming Governor of Oaxaca by means of electoral fraud.

<p>The Mexican Supreme Court decided in June 2007 that human rights violations under Ruiz Ortiz’s government should be investigated.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to exert its influence to insist that these human rights violations be investigated?</p>

<p>The European Union and the Commission are particularly attentive to the development of the Oaxaca situation and have closely monitored the unfolding of events. The Commission has therefore been kept regularly informed about events in Oaxaca by its Delegation in the country, by organisations from civil society and by the Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission raises the issue of human rights whenever it has the opportunity, as it has done since the beginning and strengthening, since 2004, of exchanges with Mexico within the framework of the political dialogue. Obviously it will continue to do this within the framework of forthcoming high-level contacts provided for under the Global Agreement, and will continue to pay particular attention to the situation in Oaxaca.</p>
<p>In parallel with our various actions under the Agreement, the EU Delegation in Mexico assisted and accompanied Erika Mann, MEP and Chairwoman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, during the parliamentary mission to Oaxaca in September 2006. There, Mrs Mann met representatives from the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO), among others.</p>
<p>The Commission also keeps itself informed of reports and observations by various national and international human rights NGOs, including on the conflict in Oaxaca. The Commission also organises meetings with these organisations to find out the results of their research and analyses of the situation. MEPs who are members of the EU-Mexico interparliamentary delegation have been involved in these meetings. At the meeting of the interparliamentary delegation in Mexico at the end of February 2007, the Commission Delegation in Mexico organised a session on human rights, during which the problem of Oaxaca was discussed.</p>
<p>More recently, the EU Council requested information on the human rights situation in the State of Oaxaca. A mission of representatives from the embassies of the Member States and from the Commission Delegation in Mexico was therefore organised from 27 to 28 August 2007. This mission held meetings with the chairman of the State Human Rights Commission (CEDHO), human rights NGOs, the President of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the government, and the Under-Secretary for Human Rights of the State of Oaxaca. A representative from the Office of the Secretary for Public Security also spoke at the monthly political advisors’ meeting in September 2007, at which the situation in Oaxaca was examined.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the Commission is cooperating actively with the United Nations High Commissioner on the subject of human rights in Mexico. It is engaged in two projects to support human rights, one of which concerns the situation of natives in the Oaxaca prison system. In this context, the issue of the conflict in Oaxaca is discussed during exchanges between the High Commissioner’s Office and the Commission, and forms part of our joint policy to defend human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0816"></a>

<p>Since 1994, the Commission has adopted five decisions on State aid concerning Olympic Airways. The first three were ‘conditional’ decisions authorising aid to be used for restructuring the company before the end of the 1990s, subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these decisions were not complied with, and the restructuring did not produce the anticipated results. Therefore in December 2002, then in September 2005, the Commission had to adopt two ‘negative’ decisions stating that Greece had given Olympic Airways and Olympic Airlines illegal aid incompatible with the common market. The first of these decisions was substantially confirmed by the European Court of First Instance, apart from a few minor aspects. It should also be mentioned that the Court of Justice stated that Greece had failed to implement the first decision. Because the Court decision declaring this failure was not implemented, the Commission has brought a case under the terms of Article 228 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>As it has done for a number of years, the European Commission is continuing discussions with the Greek authorities in order to find a solution to the problems concerning the implementation of the 2002 and 2005 decisions. The Commission’s objective is to ensure that EU law is complied with, both as regards the implementation of the 2002 and 2005 decisions and as regards any other measures that may involve the use of public funds for the benefit of Olympic Airways/Airlines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0820"></a>

<p>The Commission fully shares the two main starting points of the report: the importance and the success of Cohesion Policy in curbing disparities and thus in contributing to the EU's social, economic and territorial cohesion; and the fact that, as the result of recent enlargements, the range of such disparities are greater. The Commission is also very much aware of the pressure that globalisation poses on European economies in terms of relocations, demographic change, migration flows and other related issues. In response to these challenges, Cohesion Policy for 2007-2013 has been reformed and modernised while aligning it with the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda.</p>
<p>The Commission also agrees that, if Croatia and the Western Balkans countries were to access the EU before the end of this programming period they could be accommodated into the current framework for Cohesion Policy without major disruption. The Honourable Member should note that eligibility rules for 2007-2013 for the EU-27 were fixed in 2006 and are being applied. As regards Turkey, the Commission agrees that a specific impact assessment needs to be conducted at the appropriate time from the point of view of its likely impact on EU Cohesion Policy. According to the Negotiating Framework, accessions negotiations with Turkey can only be concluded after the establishment of the Financial Framework for the period from 2014 together with possible consequential reforms.</p>
<p>The Commission will therefore assess, at the appropriate moment, the impact of all future enlargements on the EU Cohesion Policy and propose the corresponding modifications. Until this assessment has taken place, the Commission is not in a position to comment on any estimate of associated costs.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that a sufficient financial allocation is an essential pre-requisite for ensuring the success of the policy, in line with the Commission proposals for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspectives, and is very keen on taking on board proposals aiming at increasing the leverage effect of Cohesion Policy in the current Member States, like enhancing private capital participation or using innovative financial instruments beyond subsidies. However, at this point in time, the Commission is not in a position to comment on estimates of amounts needed for any specific policy in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0831"></a>

<p>Formaldehyde is classified as a Category 3 carcinogenic since 1996 when the 22<span class="sup">nd</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances was adopted. Category 3 includes substances which cause concern for man owing to possible carcinogenic effects, but in respect of which the available information is not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment.</p>
<p>France, taking into account the recent decision of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, proposes to classify formaldehyde as Category 1 carcinogenic. Category 1 includes substances known to be carcinogenic to man. In fact, in September 2004, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that formaldehyde is carcinogenic to humans and listed it in its Group 1. This is a higher classification than previous evaluations made by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
<p>The French proposal has been discussed in November 2005 by the Technical Committee of Classification &amp; Labelling under Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. The recommendations made by this Technical Committee are used by the Commission to elaborate a proposal for an Adaptation to Technical Progress to update the list of substances of the Directive on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances by comitology. These substances are included in Annex I.</p>
<p>However, due to ongoing research on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, in particular an update of an epidemiology study of the United States National Cancer Institute, it was decided to postpone any decision to a future meeting. The results of the updated study of the National Cancer Institute should be available shortly.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the Technical Committee of Classification &amp; Labelling did not finalise its discussion on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, it was not possible to include it either in the draft proposal of the 30<span class="sup">th</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress voted in February 2007 or in the 31<span class="sup">st</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress, which will go through the comitology procedure by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>However, the French proposal will be dicussed again under the REACH<a href="#defann_58_4" name="refann_58_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> legislative framework by the Risk Assessment Committee, which should be established by June 2008. On the basis of the recomendation of this Risk Assessment Committee, the Commission could then elaborate a new proposal on the Adaptation to Technical Progress to modify the current classification of formaldehyde, if needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The consequence is that, according to the customs services, more than 70% of all counterfeit products come from China.</p>
<p>The audiovisual sector is the biggest victim of this. What is particularly annoying about it is that it is not only the big American stars who have their products counterfeited in China but also less well known European artists.

<p>Effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China is an EU priority. The Commission is aware of piracy encountered by the audiovisual sector in China and regularly addresses this issue in its bilateral talks on intellectual property matters with the Chinese authorities. For example, this issue was on the agenda of the last EU-China Intellectual Property Working Group which took place in Beijing on 27 September 2007. The Chinese authorities have made efforts to tackle this issue but these efforts are insufficient. This issue will also be on the agenda of the EU-China Summit scheduled on 28 November 2007 in China.</p>
<p>The Commission has favoured dialogue and co-operation with China to tackle piracy. This co-operative approach has produced limited results. The Commission has made it clear to China that significant progress was needed. In this respect, the EU-China Summit will be crucial to measure China's determination to meet the EU concerns. If China continues to pay insufficient attention to EU concerns regarding intellectual property issues, the Commission will consider lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0838"></a>

<p>As stated by the Honourable Member, healthcare-associated infections constitute an important burden of disease and mortality in European societies.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reflecting on a draft proposal for a Council Recommendation on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections.</p>
<p>This proposal is being prepared with the help of an international group of experts and incorporates comments from:</p>
<p>the surveillance authorities of the Community network on communicable disease, and</p>
<p>those which were made by stakeholders in the course of a public consultation in December 2005 to January 2006.</p>
<p>The principal recommendations will be establishing or strengthening:</p>
<p>Control and preventive measures to support containment of infections</p>
<p>Infection prevention and control programmes in healthcare institutions,</p>
<p>Surveillance systems according to commonly agreed standards,</p>
<p>Education, training, research and information exchange.</p>
<p>In the 2008 Commission Legislative and Work Programme, the proposal is identified as a strategic initiative, underlining the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal.</p>
<p>The objective is to put the proposal to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council during the French Presidency in 2008.</p>
<p>Given the time needed for the steps leading to adoption by the College and transmission to the Council, it is not realistic to bring the proposal forward half a year to the EPSCO Council during the Slovenian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Commission however wishes to assure the Honourable Member that it is determined to avoid any delay on this strategic initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0841"></a>

The Directive includes many forest habitat types that specifically refer to characteristic tree species which are present and for which the designation of Natura 2000 sites is required. Furthermore, the protection of trees is also important for the conservation of species such as woodpeckers and beetles, which may be dependant on mature and old trees. Therefore, the Natura 2000 network may include ancient trees, where they contribute to the conservation objectives of these sites.</p>
<p>However, there is no specific reference to the inclusion of sites in Natura 2000 exclusively on the basis of the presence of small numbers of very old trees. While such trees may have an important ecological, cultural or historical importance they are not systematically considered to be the key determinants of overall biodiversity. For this reason, the Commission does not have any plans to amend the Directive to include consideration of ancient trees among the criteria for site designation. Member States are of course free to establish national measures for protecting such important living monuments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Gas and electricity prices are continuing to rise excessively, partly because of a lack of competition, particularly in Belgium. This could lead national regulators and national authorities to impose price ceilings in order, at least somewhat, to reduce the prices paid by the final consumer.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that price ceilings (perhaps temporary) would be an acceptable and effective way of dealing with the lack of competition on the energy market for the benefit of consumers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU legal framework, in particular Articles 3(3) of the Electricity<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Gas<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Directive, allows price regulation in limited circumstances - namely, to ensure universal and public service obligations, i.e. the right for households and, if the Member State deems this appropriate, small enterprises, to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable and transparent prices. However, such price regulations cannot impede the opening of the market.<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, in order for markets to work, it is essential that supply, production and investment decisions are made using the most relevant and undistorted information. Prices are the most important piece of that information.</p>
<p>Price ceilings outside the legitimate objective of ensuring universal service as set out in the Directives may pose a significant threat to the emergence of competitive energy markets. If price ceilings are set too low or, if costs increase while regulated prices remain unchanged, electricity and gas suppliers can easily be caught in a price squeeze in which retail prices no longer allow them to cover their costs. New entrants are essential for bringing competition into previously monopolised markets, and these new entrants are particularly vulnerable as they have to rely on energy wholesale markets for sourcing electricity and gas. This risk is not theoretical. It has already occurred in several Member States.</p>
<p>This is why the Commission has had to open several infringement proceedings against Member States who have introduced regulated prices or price caps beyond the legitimate universal service objective. The Commission has also had to launch proceedings under other legal instruments including the state aid rules.</p>
<p>It should be added that properly functioning markets and price signals are also a prerequisite for guiding investment decisions. Price caps may render a market unattractive for investment and stifle capacity increase as private operators can no longer recover their costs or, at least, cannot realise the returns possible in other markets. Investments, such as in generation capacity, are however important to secure the replacement of exisiting capacity. So properly functioning markets and price signals are not only important for realising an internal energy market, but are at least equally important to achieve other policy objectives, in particular, secure energy supplies, , reaching the Kyoto targets as agreed during the 2007 Spring European Council and targets for energy savings<a href="#defann_62_4" name="refann_62_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that action needs to be focussed on the core issue, namely, measures improving competitive conditions. The Third Liberalisation Package presented by the Commssion on 19 September 2007 as well as the increased enforcement action under the EC competition rules reflect the high priority the Commission attaches to bringing about truly competitive energy markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the Augustow by-pass, which is a part of the ´Via Baltica´ project, the Commission decided on 21 March 2007 to refer the case to the Court of Justice. The decision of the Commission of 21 March 2007 also provided for interim measures on the basis of Articles 242 and 243 of the Treaty. The construction of the Augustow by-pass would lead to the destruction of a unique ecosystem and annihilation of rare Rospuda marshlands.

It must be noted that Poland confirmed later to the Court that the works in Rospuda Valley would not be initiated until the Court delivers its ruling. The Commission closely monitors the situation regarding the execution of the project.

<p>Given the recent developments surrounding the expiry of the so-called ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on Chinese exports of certain textile and clothing products to the countries of the European Union on 31 December 2007, and the pursuit of total liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing,</p>
<p>how does the Commission assess the consequences of the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing as far as this strategic industry within the European Union, and particularly on the economic viability of the companies (and specifically the SMEs) concerned, and on employment?</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s assessment of the consequences of the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing on the major importers and distributors, specifically as regards their exponential increase of their profit margins by forcing lower prices on the producers, while maintaining or increasing their margins as far as consumers are concerned?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After the expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) in 2005, to deal with the surging levels of textile imports from China, the Shanghai Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) provided for agreed levels for imports from China into the EU of ten product categories. The agreed levels apply to imports shipped from China by 31 December 2007. The MoU itself remains valid until the end of 2008.</p>
<p>That was a once and for all deal with China based on the provisions of their World Trade Organisation (WTO) entry and gave an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new challenges posed by China as a major world player in the textile sector.</p>
<p>The Commission, fully aware that other countries have concluded MoUs with import limitations which will continue until the end of 2008 and that the textile sector needs a smooth transition towards full liberalization in 2008, has held discussions with China on the best way to achieve such transition. In this spirit the Commission and China have decided to put into place a joint monitoring mechanism for trade in eight textiles product categories for 2008 (cat 4 T-shirts, cat 5 pullovers, cat 6 trousers, cat 7 blouses, cat 20 bed linen, cat 26 dresses, cat 31 brassieres and cat 115 flax and ramie yarn). The surveillance covers the economically important categories and those with particular sensitivities. The two categories not covered are those where the utilization of the agreed levels has been and remains lowest in the period 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p>By this joint surveillance, China has de facto accepted that it shares with us the responsibility to ensure a smooth transition after the expiry at the end of this year of the MoU agreed levels.</p>
<p>Member States, the textile industry and the trade sector have welcomed this agreement as they all agreed that a repeat of the 2005 situation was in nobody's interest.</p>
<p>More generally, even if trade issues are very important with respect to the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing industry, this sector in EU is facing structural changes that go beyond trade issues.</p>
<p>In fact, structural adjustment process started years before the dismantling of quotas. This made clearer that the competitive advantages of EU textiles and clothing industry lies mainly in innovation, research, labour force skills and access to markets. In this industrial sector, the reinforcement of these competitiveness strengths represents a major contribution to our Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p>The textiles and clothing industry can maintain its strategic role in the EU economy. However, the sector could provide fewer but better jobs in future. There is therefore a need for initiatives related to innovation, research and skills as the main means for the increase of viability of the sector companies.</p>
<p>After the liberalisation of the textile sector in 2005, the Commission was interested in the liberalization impact on consumer prices and has commissioned a study on the subject.</p>
<p>The study showed clearly that consumers have benefited from the progressive liberalisation of textiles trade to a considerable extent. Across the EU, clothing prices fell by 16.2% relative to the overall price level over the ATC phase-out period. There is a direct link between the progressive liberalization under the ATC and the price reduction: in average, 60% of the drop in import prices has been passed through to consumers in terms of lower prices. Consumer price being a composite of service input prices and imported products prices the drop is less than perfect.</p>
<p>The study also found evidence of a partial capture of these benefits by the distribution chain, pointing out issues of dysfunction of the Internal Market and of competition in the distribution sector. Some Member States have experienced a great decrease in consumer prices (a 50% drop of clothing prices relative to the overall price level) while others have remained largely unchanged. This overall variation across Member States in terms of consumer price reductions is linked to the structure of national service sectors and in particular the retail sector.</p>
<p>The study is the beginning of a process whereby the Commission is considering the question of how to ensure a fair distribution of the benefits of trade opening and has to be seen in the wider context of our Global Europe strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0854"></a>

<p>The Commission has announced a proposal for the Emissions Trading Scheme after 2012.

The scheme has the potential strongly to influence the use of fuels in the EU and in the Member States, the security of EU energy supply and opportunities for investment, particularly in more efficient coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>By what means does the Commission intend to ensure that the Member States’ decisions on the structure of their energy mix are respected?

<p>The structure of the energy mix remains a decision for Member States. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme only serves as an instrument to ensure that the price of carbon is taken into account in investment and production decisions. Investments in modern and more efficient power plants are thus incentivised under the Scheme, as such plants will have either spare allowances to sell, or will have to buy less allowances to cover their emissions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0857"></a>

<p>In its Communication "A new framework strategy for multilingualism"<a href="#defann_67_1" name="refann_67_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted in 2005, the Commission reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism, underlining that respect for linguistic diversity is in fact a core value of the European Union. The Commission's multilingualism policy encourages the full expression of all languages, which have the same rights and an equal value.</p>
<p>The Action Plan "Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity" (2004-2006) was the first comprehensive policy statement on languages, setting out actions at European level to make further progress in this field. These actions address all languages present in the European Union, official languages as well as national, regional, minority and migrant languages.</p>
<p>Both the Action Plan and the Communication on Multilingualism stressed the need to consider linguistic aspects of other European policies and programmes, for example in the areas of culture, media and social inclusion. In order to define the contribution of multilingualism to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Commission set up a high level group of intellectuals that will produce its recommendations by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008 is to provide means for intercultural dialogue and dialogue between citizens to strengthen respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. Its preparation has led to the development of a wider strategy to promote intercultural dialogue, involving EU programmes and instruments, as well as mobilizing Member States and all interested parties. Third countries will also be involved.</p>
<p>The school curricula for language learning fall under the responsibility of the EU Member States. Regional and minority languages are protected by the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Member States of the Council of Europe are signatories to this Charter.</p>
<p>The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is an objective of the programme Lifelong Learning 2007-2013. In the past Community support to organisations for the promotion of regional and minority languages was limited to the http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/eblul_en.html"  and the http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/mercator_en.html" . Now the Lifelong Learning Programme has been opened to other such organisations. In 2008 the transversal activity for languages in the programme will give priority to projects that reinforce the acquisition of competence in languages in order to improve intercultural dialogue in Europe. It is open to practically all languages (official languages of Members States, regional, minority, migrant, "non-EU languages", etc.). Application for projects and organisations to support and promote Romanian also as a language of minority communities are eligible under this new programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

A case in point is the unlawful measure being adopted by the 'Varvaresos' textile manufacturing company in Naousa, where an internal memorandum has been circulated to plant managers instructing them to single out workers 'due to give birth in 2007 or 2008', since the 'Varvaresos' plant, like other undertakings in general, is seeking to avoid the need to grant parental leave and pay prenatal and childbirth allowances, entitlements which workers have had to struggle to obtain. This is not unrelated to the company's plan to shut down one of its three plants, involving the immediate release of workers or the modification of employment contracts, of which the first victims are likely to be young women and women with children.

<p>The Danube Black Sea (DABLAS) initiative was launched following a 2001 Commission Communication<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that highlighted the land based pollution problems faced by the Danube-Black Sea region and outlined the Commission approach to deal with it.</p>
<p>As tributaries to the Black Sea, the two rivers Dniester and Dnieper are already within the overall scope of the initiative, even though their river basins are not shared by any Member State of the EU.</p>
<p>The Communication underlined that the two relevant environmental conventions (Convention on Co-operation and Protection and Sustainable use of the Danube River and the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution or Black Sea Convention) should be the basis for regional cooperation. The Black Sea Convention has continued to be actively involved in DABLAS throughout its development.</p>
<p>The importance of the Black Sea Convention as the forum for regional environmental cooperation has also been acknowledged in the recent Black Sea Synergy Communication<a href="#defann_70_2" name="refann_70_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Following this then Commission has been exploring the possibility for the European Community to become a Contracting Party to this Convention. This will require an amendment to the Convention to allow the possibility for regional economic integration organisations such as the European Community to become a Contracting Party.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Parliament and Council are currently negotiating the proposed Marine Strategy Directive, which will aim at ensuring good environmental status by 2021 in the seas surrounding the EU, including the Black Sea. To this end, the Directive will require an additional effort of cooperation at regional level to properly involve other concerned countries in its implementation, including for tackling land-based pollution. In this context, the Black Sea Convention appears a privileged forum upon which such cooperation could be built up in the region for the purpose of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Innumerable animals are still being subjected to unspeakable suffering when being transported on European roads, e.g. watering times are not adhered to, calves injured during transport have to be put down. The EU Directive lays down a maximum journey time of 8 hours, yet a sheep transport from Spain to Greece is recorded as taking a full 96 hours. Austrian animal conservationists have now set up an internet site (http://www.gegentiertransporte.at" </p>
<p>) and have already collected over 60 000 signatures in support of their stand against these abuses.</p>
<p>How can these 60 000 and more signatures be used most effectively so as to ensure that Parliament and also the Commission and Council take firmer action on the issue of these abuses in the transportation of live animals? When can a report on animal transport be expected from the Commission?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the views of the Honourable Member regarding the importance for EU institutions to take into account the concerns expressed by the EU citizens on animal welfare.</p>
<p>Among those issues the correct implementation of the Regulation on the protection of animals during transport is a top priority for the Commission.</p>
<p>But it is not an issue falling solely under the responsibilities of the Commission.</p>
<p>Member States have the full responsibility to find proper solutions to ensure rapidly adequate enforcement of the rules.</p>
<p>EU rules on animal transport foresee strict requirements for vehicles, drivers and loading/unloading conditions.</p>
<p>At the last October 2008 Council of Ministers of Agriculture the question of better enforcement of the EU animal transport legislation was discussed. Ministers called for stringent respect of EU legislation in all Member States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Commission vigilantly monitors enforcement of the Regulation on transport in Member States.</p>
<p>Both missions of Commission veterinary experts and complaints from Non-Governmental Organisations are highlighting that there is an urgent demand for coordinated actions. At the same time the Commission is aware that corrective actions to remedy shortcomings have been undertaken in certain Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is always ready to initiate action against Member States which do not implement measures to enforce EU rules on animal welfare.</p>
<p>The use of navigation systems for long distance transport will improve controls and make targeted actions possible. The establishing of national contact points for animal transport and the creation of networks of competent authorities in Member States will facilitate the prevention of such episodes of mistreatment of animals. It is however not only a matter of sanctions and controls. Strong political will is necessary to reinforce the importance of animal welfare in the operators in the food chain.</p>
<p>Concerning the future Commission proposal on the revision of travelling times and space allowances, a specific impact assessment will be carried out in 2008. This impact assessment will in particular include a comprehensive study on the current state of play of the implementation of the above mention aspects of the legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0870"></a>

<p>Various publications recently announced the market release of a product labelled ‘C-Ice Swiss Cannabis Ice Tea’ in a number of countries across Europe. Launched first in Switzerland, the beverage is now available in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria (non-exhaustive list). The producer explains that, to make it legal, the narcotic elements of the plant have been removed from the tea, and it is described as containing five per cent hemp flower syrup and a tiny (0.0015 per cent) quantity of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). However, this is not clear to consumers. There is a great concern that selling the product is dangerous and will lead to ‘normalisation of cannabis as an image in young people’s minds’. It even seems to be marketed as a health drink.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider such marketing strategies appropriate at a time when the use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, especially among young people, is turning into a serious problem for society?</p>
<p>Does the Commission envisage specific measures with regard to influencing control over advertising and marketing practices that could promote positive connotations of products or substances known in any other form or quantity to be of an illegal or harmful nature?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A brand name or a name, under which a foodstuff is sold, that contains the word "Cannabis" is indeed of concern from a public health point of view.</p>
<p>Firstly, labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs sold to the ultimate consumer is regulated by the general food labelling directive 2000/13/EC. The general rules prohibit the use of information that would mislead the consumer.</p>
<p>Secondly, cannabis is classed as an illicit drug in all Member States and is scheduled as such in the relevant United Nations Conventions. To market a product that even claims to contain this substance is inconsistent with the fight against drug trafficking and consumption in the EU which is a priority for all Member States and is based on a number of legislative instruments at EU level as well as on the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 and the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008.</p>
<p>In addition to existing efforts under the EU's Public Health Programme, considerable funding is moreover being released this year under the EU's Specific programme on Drug Prevention and Information, designed to support the Member States in their efforts to counter drug consumption. The marketing of products by appealing to an attraction for those drugs therefore runs counter to anti drug policies pursued by all Member States. It is also the reason, why some Member States have prohibited the placing of concerned foodstuffs on their market on the basis of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, which can justify a ban on grounds of public morality as well as public health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
