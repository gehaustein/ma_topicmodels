<p class="contents">I endorse the criteria of greater prudence adopted, but other aspects of the matter must also be taken into consideration, particularly the solvency ratio, which is a weighting factor according to the type of counter-party used to estimate the credit risk associated with a bank's assets. In Italy, this is currently fixed at 8% – 7% for banking groups – of the weighted risk assets, for both cash and off-balance-sheet items.</p>

Those in favour of the directive can legitimately demand that their interests be protected, and mediation is required if a fair regulations are to be devised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in the first place, savers who could profit from harmonised EU-wide regulation because their investments would be protected against losses in accordance with identical criteria. On the other side of the argument are the SMEs, which fear that regulation would make it difficult for them to raise credit because they would not be able to compete with the guarantees which large companies are able to provide. As a result, there might be job losses in SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">A second conflict of interests arises from the fact that, on the one hand, a fairly long transitional period is required in order to provide as many banks as possible, especially smaller institutions, with the opportunity to implement the necessary new regulations in their internal operations. On the other hand, a delay in implementing the regulations favours American banks, which profit from the current set of regulations and are able to undercut European banks in Europe. We must not allow our companies to be disadvantaged in this way, but without playing large European companies, powerful as they are, off against smaller ones, to the detriment of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the demand for a solution to be found to the conflict between the United States and the EU, produced by the discriminatory Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, it may be said that the demand for European harmonisation is legitimate and that the latter would bring benefits to all sides in terms of security and fairness.

I believe this is an important report, and I am therefore proud and happy that it is to be debated and voted upon on a Friday, for Friday is a working day like any other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the view that, as a European Parliament, we can also be proud of the fact that we have got the idea of a European Police College under way. As you know, the idea came about in 1995 at a professional convention in Deggendorf in Lower Bavaria and was unanimously adopted in 1998 by this Parliament in the context of a report on internal security and eastward enlargement. At the time, we were concerned with the important matter, which we are finding ever more pressing, of not only having to get the applicant countries ready economically for accession but also of having to ensure, above all, that the framework conditions in terms of democracy, constitutionality and administration were right. On reading the latest progress reports, we note that there has been a considerable improvement in the way in which the legislation has been transposed. However, the way in which the legislation is applied in the applicant countries is still problematic because it is huge task, after decades of dictatorship, to construct new police forces, new systems of justice and new public prosecution authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we produced at that time, we said that, in those countries which had found their way to democracy through their own efforts, we wanted, after decades of police States, to see the training of police who did not only genuinely accept the standards of European democracy but were also prepared to act in partnership. That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose. This idea of Parliament's was then adopted at the Tampere Summit, and I am very grateful to the Council for adopting this project, originated by Parliament, as its own. I am especially grateful to Commissioner Vitorino who has shown his vigorous commitment to a European Police College, something which also finds expression in the fact that the Portuguese government, which thinks along similar lines to himself, has thankfully seized this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the will of the Council and of that of this Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the European Police College is to become a reality as early as next year, more precisely as part of a network of national police training institutes with a joint remit, joint leadership and joint training programmes. However, we want this only to be a first step and we want an actual Police College to be set up within no more than two or three years. In this context, I should like to refer to a valuable comment by the French Presidency of the Council which said that we need a common, actually existing Police College of this kind in order to create a European culture of police training.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint training of this kind is urgently needed when it comes to protecting external borders and combating cross-border crime and also when it comes to applying human rights standards in the European Union. It also has very wide support from police trade unions and professional associations. They know that, in the border area between the current EU and the applicant countries, such as in Eastern Bavaria, a great many towns have already asked for such a Police College. I am of the view, however, that it is still too early to make a decision on the matter. Naturally, that would be the best place for it to be located. It is now firstly a question, however, of actually creating this Police College, and all political forces are together helping to achieve this goal. I would thank the Bavarian and German ministers of the interior, as well as former Austrian Minister of the Interior Schlögel, who together made this possible back in Tampere. I believe this is a one-off opportunity to create a Europe in practical terms, namely a constitutional Europe that does not just exist in some documents or other but finds expression on an everyday basis. As the European Parliament, we can be proud that this is one of our own ideas and initiatives, which is to become a reality in just a few months’ time.</p>

This is a cause to which he has demonstrated his ongoing and productive commitment. We have before us a very useful instrument which will allow us not only to optimise police cooperation between Member States but also to improve cooperation with candidate countries and with Norway and Iceland.</p>
<p class="contents">This police cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the very important objective of affording European citizens a high degree of security within the European area of freedom, security and justice. The intention of the Portuguese Presidency in presenting this initiative, following the Tampere conclusions and in order to meet the deadlines laid down in the ‘scoreboard’, was to initiate the preliminary stage of the European Police College by creating a network of the national institutes already existent in each Member State in order to improve the training of senior police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, we are beginning to train the next generation of police officers to work and operate throughout Europe; in other words, we will be preparing them to implement Community law and joint and Community actions. This will be a kind of virtual police academy, whose task will be to improve mutual familiarity with the Member States’ national police systems and structures, to increase familiarity with international instruments and to optimise cooperation and coordination between the College and the other European multinational police training institutes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no doubt that it will be easier to reach consensus at this first stage. The transition to the second stage, that is, the institutional and physical creation of the future European Police College, is bound to raise some problems. We know that there are still a number of Member States that support the creation of the College only as a permanent network of national institutes, but we feel that the majority will accept this proposal as a temporary stage that will make it possible to create a tangible institution within a maximum of three years. This is also the proposal that the Commission supports, which has been so vigorously advocated by Commissioner Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People’s Party. The rapporteur goes even further, proposing that the deadline should be brought forward to two years; as soon as the proposed objectives can be achieved, it would certainly be in the common interest to be able to relax the deadlines in order to give substance to the area of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the report by Mr Posselt, who has done some sterling work, it is a fact that judicial and police cooperation is new territory for the European Union and that every proposal that comes up for discussion marks progress. The Tampere conclusions clearly expressed the need to set up a European Police College. I believe that the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs have enriched the proposal put forward by the Portuguese Presidency. For example, we believe that police training should not be confined to cross-border police cooperation and to combating crime, but should cover other areas of policy, such as human rights, the provision of services to citizens, the use of new technologies, non-repressive law enforcement, crime prevention methods, respect for the rule of law, and knowledge of the political and socio-economic developments in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these areas, the police college can play an important role by promoting more effective practices and up-to-date methods, either in the form of a network coordinating national training establishments, or as an actual college with a permanent seat. Naturally priority should be given to the countries with which the European Union is conducting accession negotiations. The enlargement of the European Union, which will extend the space in which citizens are free to move, should be accompanied by supplementary measures ensuring safety and peaceful co-existence among the Member States. The candidate countries must not delay their full integration in the third pillar of justice and home affairs. To this end, they must establish specific frameworks for cooperation between the European Police College and the police forces in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the European Parliament has an exclusively advisory role in all this. But the establishment of new European infrastructures will necessarily impact on the lives of its citizens, especially in relation to matters of policing. That is why I would like to call on the Council, which I believe is absent today, to carefully study the amendments we have tabled and to pay serious attention to the opinion of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just have a few reservations with regard to the name. The term ‘police academy’ makes me think of a humorous American TV series about the police. What is more, I find the word ‘academy’ is not assertive enough when it comes to police operations. That is just a minor detail, of course. I think that it is more important to confine ourselves to the essentials.</p>
<p class="contents">Social conditions in most Member States of the European Union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross-border cooperation between the various police forces. Cross-border cooperation can only lead to results if a number of conditions are met, if the greatest care is taken over appropriate, goal-directed programmes for ongoing training, if attention is paid to training regarding the Member States’ response to crisis situations in third countries and if exchanges and secondments are made possible in a professional way, with the emphasis on the professional aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention must also be paid to training at European level with regard to crime prevention, maintenance of public order and efficient border control. On the other hand, a European Police College needs to become the forum for gaining an understanding of the various national police systems and defending the knowledge they have.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I hope that there will be no delay in giving concrete expression to this initiative which, to my mind and also in my Group's opinion, answers the need to bring about a European training structure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These rights are very differently interpreted in different parts of the Union. I come from a country in which the maximum period of detention allowed by law is 110 days. After 110 days of detention a person, if not tried, must be released and never tried for that offence again.</p>
<p class="contents">From what I see, conditions in French and Portuguese jails are very different. People can be kept for enormously long periods of time awaiting trial. We do not really have a common culture in Europe on these important points.</p>
<p class="contents">This connects exactly to our culture of policing. Do we have a culture of policing in which the idea is to detain people as briefly as necessary, find the evidence as quickly and expeditiously as possible and get trials moving forward, or do we have a system where people do it as it suits them best? If we could develop a common culture of policing in Europe, and if it were based on best practice, then that would be a fine thing. But, as I have said in another debate this week, the danger is that we develop a kind of general casualness, we have moved to the lowest common denominator, not the highest common factor. Let us make sure that if we have a police college it is, as Mr Posselt's report stresses, grounded in the need to develop and enhance respect for human and civil rights in our police culture. Police efficiency is not just to do with grabbing guys and putting them inside. It is to do with finding the people who actually commit crimes and proving the case against them in a civilised way, with a proper connection between prosecution services and police services. If we can get a police college for the whole of Europe to do that or begin to develop this kind of common culture that would be a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college. I see the need for a permanent seat for its administration but I want Members of the House to think seriously about whether, in the interest of a common police culture in Europe, it would be better to take everybody to one place or to have courses which move year-by-year or subject-by-subject to different police colleges and academies in different parts of the Union. That way, people begin to appreciate differences of local assumption, differences of local approach. We hope that over time our police forces will genuinely learn from each other and learn best practice from each other, not worst practice. If that could be done we would have a police academy of which we, as Europeans, might be proud. I hope that will be the result of this excellent proposal and this excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The questions arise, however, of what this College is for and of what tasks and objectives it has. To take just one point, Mr Posselt writes of 'providing training sessions for senior national police officers on the basis of common standards'. That is when things already begin to get difficult. What are these common standards? As you know, Mr Posselt, police duties in the Federal Republic of Germany are a matter for the individual Länder, which are absolutely sovereign in this area. Now, compare the various Länder’s laws on police duties. You will see that, in Brandenburg (unlike in Berlin), de-escalation is the supreme precept when it comes to deploying police and that, under Brandenburg law, any police who are to be deployed are obliged to be identified by name so that anyone who might be attacked in a demonstration can read the name of the policeman concerned and know who it was. In other words, if you want common standards, you have to start by defining these. Otherwise, you end up with training that may be completely different in form from area to area. A College along these lines is not really needed just for the purpose of exchanging different types of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">You speak about establishing public order. All right, that is accepted. Again, the only question is, with what resources? In the Federal Republic of Germany, even public order is defined completely differently in the various Länder’s laws relating to police duties. What do you understand to mean by public order? You write in your report about border control services. I ask you! We make a perfectly clear distinction between duties relating to the protection of Federal borders and the duties of the police. (In other States, it is different.) If you write in those terms, then before what you say can be approved, it must first be clear what common activities are planned and according to what standards one is going to proceed. As long as such matters have not been clarified, I have to say to you in all honesty that I myself cannot consent to the basic idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet another interim but not so short-term<span class="bold"> </span>decision, another little present to Parliament from the Council. Just as Europol grew out of the "Drugs" unit, so the seed of judicial cooperation will produce Eurojust and maybe a European prosecution service. We can therefore safely say that a lightweight and currently practically non-existent structure such as the European Police College will give rise to yet another bureaucratic structure, almost as if it were in the genetic code of the European Union to entwine policies in red tape. It is clear, blindingly obvious and even banal to state that it is necessary to fight organised crime operating at transnational level with transnational policies, just as it goes without saying that national police forces need to be trained in order to be better equipped to tackle the cultural, legal and linguistic crime issues raised by both European integration and the integration of criminal organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we do not feel that this makes it necessary to create a new structure. The underlying reasons for establishing a police college – reasons which we endorse – could have been better and more effectively achieved by encouraging existing national academies to develop training courses, exchanges, MA courses and specialisations to fill the gap which does, in effect, exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, the fact remains that Mr Posselt's work is, in our opinion, excellent. On the other hand, we fail to understand the position of the Socialist Members. Mrs Karamanou has just stated that she welcomes the fact that Parliament will have an advisory role, and yet, only the other day, the Group of the Party of European Socialists voted against a motion on the grounds that the Europol Management Board was to include Members of Parliament with the right to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Posselt's work has resulted in provision at last being made for police training to include human rights and the right of defence, and the proposal is also important and appropriate at the moment to create a virtual police college which would take advantage of the potential offered by the Internet. In general, instead of taking advantage of the new economy to develop a new policy of employment structures and organisation, the European Union is still trying to work and organise itself according to last century's criteria.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Farage (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, according to the Council decision on the establishment of the European police college, the aim of the EPC is to help train senior law enforcement officers of the Member States. I note that the rapporteur wants to change "law enforcement officers" to "police", which is probably a good idea. But what also caught my eye is that this training is aimed at supporting and developing a European approach in the field of crime-fighting and protecting internal security. The rapporteur wishes to see added crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and border surveillance and also wants internal security modified to include maintaining law and order.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem I have with these statements is that I am not quite sure what the European approach to maintaining law and order, etc, actually involves. It is not specified in either the Council decision or the rapporteur's report. All I can say, from a strictly British perspective, is that if this means that continental practices are to become <span class="italic">de rigeur</span> throughout Europe, our own police force will be taking an unhealthy interest in armoured cars, water cannon, tear-gas launchers and dinky little pistols which they can swing from their already over-laden belts.</p>
<p class="contents">This apart, it is something of a surprise to find that there is even such a thing as a European approach to crime fighting. I am absolutely certain that it will come as a rude shock to most of the British population that internal security is an area where there is any room for involvement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It will probably come as an even greater shock for them to learn that the European Parliament wants the European police college to be responsible for training police forces and border control forces – that is to say customs and excise – in order to prepare them for the use of Community law and the implementation of common and Community measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There it is: Community law and common and Community measures. The cat is out of the bag. Clear as day we can see the ambition of the EU naked in tooth and claw; a common approach – the European approach – to fighting crime and internal security; one people, one law and one police force. I am sure that the European Union will be far more subtle than this. Our police force will retain their uniforms, right down to the comforting woolly pullies that they have taken to wearing. The ranks will be the same and the local badges will be untouched. From all the outward signs the facade will be unchanged but, under the expert tutelage of the European college, they will be working to a different agenda: a European agenda, applying Community law and Community measures.</p>
<p class="contents">That is such a far cry from the Common Market which the United Kingdom joined in 1973. No-one in the UK would ever have believed a soothsayer from that period who warned that it would all end up in Dixon of Dock Green whistling "Ode to Joy" and working out how to apply the European approach to policing down at the nick.</p>
<p class="contents">But here we are in Strasbourg in a near-deserted Chamber hearing that which is almost unbelievable. Our own Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, his Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook and other British ministers may deny that a superstate is on its way, but when I hear proposals for our own police forces to be trained in a European approach to crime fighting and internal security, it is obvious that the writing is on the wall. As you can probably gather, I will not be supporting this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If he reads the records of some of the representatives from his own Member State, the United Kingdom, in those days they were extreme left-wing socialists who forecast everything which seems to scare him with the same hysterical sort of attitude to European Union. They forecast all the things which seem to frighten him today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a different part of the political spectrum, it is very interesting to hear him repeat, with the same hysteria, the same concerns. Their capital in those days was Moscow or Budapest. Those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for. However, I am glad to say that attitudes in the Labour party in Britain have changed.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mr Posselt for his report. The work we do on a Friday morning in Parliament has the same legitimacy as the work we do on a Monday or any other day. Indeed it was commented that on Wednesday evening when the Commissioner spoke about BSE, somebody drew attention to the fact that there were only 17 people in the House. There are a lot more people here this morning and I will regret the passing of Friday when we can carry on a real debate and respond to each other and take the time to listen to each other. Parliament and democracy in Europe will be the poorer for the shortening of the Strasbourg week.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I welcome this proposal. Parliament can be proud that the proposal to set up this academy originated here, and we are grateful to the Portuguese presidency for taking it up and the Commission and Council for their support. It is a good idea and in the European Union where people have freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the right of establishment, where travellers from Scotland can go to Sicily or Greece, it is only logical to expect to develop a common system of maintaining the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That common approach is not there at the moment. I come from a state where the police developed out of a chaotic situation – a civil war. But the people at that time established, very wisely, an unarmed police force that is very socially engaged with the communities in which they live and work. You might call them a soft police force but they did succeed in healing the wounds of a civil war and in bringing credibility to the idea of law and order. When I come to continental Europe I am a bit surprised at the way police distance themselves and adopt what appears to be a harder attitude. I will welcome a levelling-out of standards in some Member States in the European Union. All of us have experienced abuses in our own countries. I hope that this academy will help us to have a better understanding of the whole system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since border controls within the European Union disappeared, they also no longer take any notice of state boundaries. Cross-border crime requires a cross-border approach. Because everyone agrees about that, closer cooperation between the police from the different Member States and their regions has already been worked on for years. Three days ago, following publication of the Marinho, Karamanou and Roure reports, I pointed to the dangers attached to this. An enlarged and centralised police force, disconnected from its surroundings, will look for its own priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a European Police College is based on the assumption that there is agreement on the tasks and modus operandi of the police. We see that the police in one country react totally differently to the same situation than the police in another country. In the Netherlands, the police are trained in the de-escalation of conflicts and in repressive tolerance whereby the existence of subcultures and ethnic minorities, the organisation of political protest and the use of churches as ports of refuge for illegal immigrants are seen as normal social phenomena. I am under the impression that, in some other countries, violence is still used as a method of winning prestige, on behalf of the government, in combating everything that can cause unrest.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the contribution made by President De Gaulle to establishing peace in Algeria was held up by Mr Posselt as a model for the role which Mr Kostunica will have to play in order to solve the Kosovo problem. He also cited the situation in which Hitler could claim that he could exterminate the Jews without being punished because, after all, nobody remembered the mass murder of the Armenians any more. At such moments, I can agree with Mr Posselt to a very large extent. On the other hand, we shall probably remain permanently in disagreement about the vision for the police.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer a small-scale, trained and organised police force, constantly driven by signals from the society within which it must function. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the rapid progress made both by the Portuguese Presidency, which launched this initiative, and by the French Presidency, which intends to adopt it by the end of the year. I therefore feel that the efforts made by us all will have made it possible to effectively create the European Police College just one year after the decision taken by the Tampere European Council. I should also like to congratulate and thank the European Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and particularly its rapporteur, Mr Posselt, not only for his personal commitment but also for the excellent study that he has produced and for the way in which he has pushed for the creation of the European Police College.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future of the College, the Commission is – as I am sure you will be aware – of the opinion that Conclusion No 47 of the Tampere European Council laid down, extremely clearly, that the network-style functioning of the College, which is already causing it also to be called a ‘virtual’ Academy, will be only the first stage. Like the European Parliament, the Commission feels that it would be desirable for a formula to be adopted within a practical and clearly defined timescale, ensuring greater continuity of training action or even its development beyond the senior police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make it clear, however, that what we are talking about here is not the creation of a European police force. We are talking about the need to exchange experience and information, to exchange best practices in crime fighting in order to make respect for citizens’ rights and the fight against transnational crime more effective. Above all, I wish to emphasise that, as someone who has always advocated the idea of community policing, which is the method employed in the United Kingdom, I would welcome the fact that this British idea is finding ever more support in a range of countries in so-called “continental Europe”. Whoever believes that the solutions that they advocate are good should not have anything to fear from exposure to other people’s solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that the transition from a virtual police academy or police staff college to a police academy as an institution is not only justified from the point of view of the operational ability of the current Member States’ police forces. It is also justified from the point of view of being able, as early as possible, to systematically include the police forces of the candidate countries in a training strategy. I consider this to be an extremely important priority, not only for the candidate countries but also to ensure that the guarantees that we have to provide for our citizens that enlargement will be accompanied by safeguards for the security of Member States. I should like to assure Parliament that the Commission is willing to continue to cooperate, both with regard to creating the Academy and to ensuring its smooth operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted Mr Posselt’s proposal that, in 2003, the Commission could draw up a report on the College’s future, on the basis of a study produced by its management board. The Commission is prepared to undertake this task if that is what is decided. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the idea that Council currently has in mind. The Council wishes the Police College to develop primarily with an intergovernmental approach. Our priority is to see actions in the field of training launched as quickly as possible. The fact that the Commission is not playing a central role in this process, however, does not mean that we will not be paying close attention to the process, doing all that we can to ensure that it is a success, and I am convinced that this project will help to improve security in the area of freedom, security and justice, since freedom and justice can only exist in an environment of genuine security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Combating crime is simply a pretext.

<p class="contents">It is especially important to stress that the European Police College, which is expected to start its operations on 1 January 2001, is not simply a network of the national training institutes of the Member States of the European Union; it also involves the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

We find the objectives of the proposal are excellent: to establish training programmes for senior officials and staff in the police forces of Member States, but also applicant countries, in all crime-fighting areas necessitating cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think the method adopted for this initiative is perfectly appropriate: we are not going to set up a new European structure liable to be rather divorced from reality at the national level, but rather to create a College in the form of a network made up of the existing national training institutes for senior police officers. Each national unit would accommodate one section of the European Police College. In this way, the College would not be based in any one place, but would be present everywhere. Its governing board would be made up of all the directors of the national institutes, who would therefore have the benefit of full knowledge of the facts when determining their requirements. This arrangement would guarantee the College’s remaining permanently close to grass-roots developments, avoiding any divergence between the approach of the college and that of the national technical experts to actual problems. Moreover, it would be flexible in its organisation, offering great potential for development, with the possibility of training programmes being held at the best qualified national institute for each aspect. This is a good illustration of what we are starting to call ‘Network Europe’, a Europe which puts nations in contact with each other directly, without the need to maintain pointless superstructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this instrument, which we find perfectly satisfactory, does not seem to appeal greatly to the European Parliament. The amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are pushing in the opposite direction, emphasising that this is a temporary structure, that the time period for revision must be short, and that a permanent headquarters must be found for the organisation. At this rate, there is a great danger that, in a few years’ time, we will find ourselves with a new costly superstructure that thinks itself superior to the national services, that does not cooperate well with them and ends up not being efficient enough. According to what I have been told, this is the route that Europol is going to go down if we do not soon take steps to change its course.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the most effective way of working, for the European Police College, as for most of the other areas of cooperation, especially in the police, justice and security sector, is to establish networks between the existing national services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This role was first developed by President Plumb, following a request from many women in France whose children had been abducted and with whom they were no longer in contact. They were seeking Parliament's help. Since then, many other people have also sought the help of the European Parliament when their children have been abducted.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked on these issues for over six years and, very much thanks to the help and resources of the European Parliament, have had several significant successes in recovering children who have been abducted. Most of the cases of child abduction are actually handled very efficiently and appropriately by the central authorities in all Member States. Unfortunately, I generally find myself dealing with the more complex cases.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of this regulation, which has been essentially rushed through during the French presidency, is the question of access to children by non-custodial parents. It has already been dubbed "the Brussels 3" issue, not so much a directive as a regulation. As such, it has the limitations of the Brussels 2 Convention, but also some of its strengths. It refers exclusively to children of couples who have married. It refers to children under the age of 16. It is also a directive whose scope has been described as both modest and pragmatic – and indeed it is a modest little regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The precise scope of it would cover parents, living in a different Member State from where the guardianship judgment was made, who were looking for visiting rights. It would allow the child to be brought to another Member State for a limited period in order for the visiting right to be exercised.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucial to its operation would be the principle that a judgment made on visiting rights in one Member State is recognised throughout the EU. An exception to this principle would be if the guardian parent proves that, due to new circumstances, the visit would endanger the physical and moral health of the child. Undoubtedly, this regulation will work in tandem with the Hague Convention on the transnational abduction of children. It does not seek to impose on other Member States the existing law of one Member State; it is simply an attempt at mutual enforcement of these custody orders.</p>
<p class="contents">There are constitutional concerns in some Member States, notably Germany and Austria. There is concern that the applicant parent can apply for access to the child, with only eight days for the other parent to respond to the request. Undoubtedly, many of our courts are very slow and ponderous, and there is great difficulty in getting them to act quickly on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also concern about the forcible return of a child. My belief is that the existence of good law, applicable in all Member States, has had a significant effect in reducing the number of abductions of children. Hopefully, this is what this regulation will ensure between Member States. Unfortunately, it does not apply outside the European Union, and there are fears that it will cut across the Hague Convention. But the Council of Ministers will discuss this, and I recommend its acceptance to the House.</p>

<p class="contents">The French initiative warrants a favourable welcome. It is part of the gradual development of judicial cooperation in civil matters and its communitisation. It is a proposal for a regulation that seeks to make exercising rights of access and accommodation for the children of separated parents easier, in an attempt to prevent children becoming a kind of hostage in the dispute between parents who are resident in different Member States. In these cases, situations unfortunately often occur that correspond to the cycle of love, hate and the desire for revenge of one or both of the parents. Hence the need for speed in order to protect the well-being of the children and, sometimes, their very safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe in which its citizens are able to move around freely, regardless of their State of origin, one can easily understand the ease with which family ties are established between people of different nationalities or who are resident in different countries. It is also understandable that lawsuits arise, specifically divorces and the regulation of parental power, which could lead to problems with regard to the exercise of rights of access when the child lives in another country, as in cases of abduction, particularly when the child is not returned by the parent who holds rights of access within the specified time.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation establishes the principle of mutual recognition of judgments for rights of access to children without any intermediary steps and limits the possibilities for seeking the suspension of the enforcement of such judgments. In this way, the regulation responds to the need for a direct application of uniform rules on such important issues as the regulation of parental power and the exercise of visiting rights. We are thereby improving Community spirit and European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless a matter for regret that the scope of this regulation is limited, since it does not cover the families of unmarried couples, in which there are children born outside of marriage, whose rights will not, as a result, be recognised and enforced under Community law. Now, this is a very common situation in our states. According to the latest statistics produced by Eurostat, in 1998, 26% of all births in the Union took place outside marriage and these numbers are continuing to increase. It is therefore crucial that this loophole must be plugged for reasons of fairness, of realism given the way society is changing and for the sake of equal rights and obligations for all of the European Union’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say in conclusion that I support the amendment proposed by the rapporteur in Article 1, in which it must be specified that the period of access should not be less than one day. In particular, we must take account of the fact that situations sometimes occur in which the parent comes from the other side of the Union, travelling thousands of kilometres, and so it is pointless to do this for a visit limited to one hour. This is ridiculous. Maintaining relations with both parents is an essential part of the child's upbringing and the development of his or her personality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A Europe without borders has most certainly contributed to an increase in the number of marriages between couples with different nationalities from both the E.U. and third countries. But when such marriages break down, there are often problems of ensuring personal contact between children and one of the parents, especially when the children reside in another Member State. And, as previous speakers have already pointed out, there has also been an increase in the number of cases of abduction with the child not being returned by one of the parents. That is why this regulation, which seeks to simplify the enforcement of rights of the parents with the aim of ensuring that children are able to maintain regular contact with both parents, is of major significance.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the Brussels II Regulation, which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents. Mr Coelho gave some very pertinent statistics and, personally, I think it is an unacceptable anachronism that, in the Europe of the twenty-first century, we legislate simply with regard to conventionally legitimate children and institutionalised human relations and that we significantly limit the scope of a regulation which is good in all other respects. I believe that there is a need for an immediate review of all regulations based on standards which have been overtaken by life and by contemporary reality. It is also necessary to take the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union more seriously into account when hammering out regulations and to give more serious consideration to the repeatedly expressed views and positions of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Often, couples go their separate ways in a civilised manner. They find it unpleasant to continue sharing each other's lives, but they do not start hating their ex-partner. Unfortunately, others separate on the basis of accumulated hatred. Parents who separate on that basis are a disaster for their children who become victims of that insoluble conflict. One parent wants the absolute power of decision over the children in order to exclude the other parent forever.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is familiar with the awful situation in which the parent to whom custody of the child is awarded, often the mother, tries to make contact with the other parent impossible. We also recognise the equally terrible situation in which the other parent, often the father, abducts the child and makes him or her untraceable. Children remember that sort of occurrence for their whole lives. My mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago, and she still talks about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Banotti has tried to make creative use of all the possibilities for securing effective arrangements for parental access on a cross-border basis too. She is trying to preclude all situations in which parents can misuse the existence of different rules of law in the Member States of the European Union in order to delay or prevent effective arrangements for parental access. A part of her solution involves drastically curtailing the right to call in a judge in order to overturn a foreign court order.</p>
<p class="contents">That regulation will only work if both parents are nationals of an EU country or are resident within the European Union and if their relationship was confirmed by a legal marriage. Only a part of the problem will be solved, but a precedent will be created. If we also start applying something similar to other situations, we are undertaking in the future to have centralised unitary legislation such as does not even exist between the 50 States of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I see drawbacks. But I have many more objections to tackling legal weaknesses and setting precedents in ways that leave social problems permanently unsolved. Because we support the goal that has been set, we are voting for the proposed measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Banotti on her excellent report, which is part of thorough, ongoing work on protecting and guaranteeing children’s rights. As the House knows, the Commission and the Council have the firm intention of adopting a programme of mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters by the end of the year. Priority was specifically given in this programme to family disputes, as laid down by the Tampere European Council. The French government’s initiative is the first practical step towards this. I should like to emphasise that, although this report and this subject are being discussed on a Friday morning, I hope that the media, which so often says that European debates have nothing to do with the everyday lives of our citizens, understands that, on this occasion, with this subject, we are addressing an issue that affects not only the life but also the hearts of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In May, we adopted a regulation incorporating the Brussels II Convention into Community law. This regulation simplifies and clarifies rules on defining the competent court and the relevant law for regulating divorces, separations and the allocation of parental control. This French initiative therefore refers to the scope of the Brussels II Regulation and is, if I may put it this way, a revolutionary initiative. I say this because, for the first time, it enshrines the abolition of the <span class="italic">exequatur</span> for the automatic recognition of a judgment by a court in a Member State by the legal system of another Member State. While it is true, however, that it is a great step forward from this point of view, I also share the opinion of Mrs Banotti and other honourable Members that it is deplorable that the scope of this regulation should be limited to the protection of children of marriages that are recognised as such by the law. This fact is bound by the scope of the Brussels II legislation itself. What I therefore wish to tell Parliament is that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters – which we hope will be adopted by the end of this year – the Commission proposes that the first and utmost priority should be given to extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, of this regulation on rights of access, covering both the children of married couples and those of unmarried couples without discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the document – as you know, this is not a Commission initiative – I should simply like to make three observations. The first is that we are working together with the Council in order to improve the text, specifically with regard to its most complex issue, which is the delicate balance between the need to guarantee that the child will be returned immediately after the visit, and also the need to safeguard the possibility of guaranteeing protection of the child whenever this should prove necessary. We are addressing a tragic issue here, that of the abduction or improper withholding of children, which is, unfortunately, much more common than we might think. It is difficult to find this balance, but we are convinced that it will be possible, with the help of your amendments and with the climate of dialogue that exists with the Council, to reach a solution that is both technically flawless and, above all, workable.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, I wish to emphasise that the Commission has some difficulties with Amendment No 1, tabled by Mrs Banotti, because this is not merely a procedural amendment, but an amendment that takes us into the field of the harmonisation of substantive family law, establishing a lower limit of one day for the exercising of rights of access. I am sure that the intention behind this amendment is valid, but it could have harmful effects if we consider that courts will only grant rights of access when they feel that this must be for a whole day. There are solutions in which the courts grant rights of access for a period of less than a day for reasons to do with the protection of the child itself. I feel that we should lay down an indicative criterion but not a legal obligation, trusting judges who are called on to apply the law to be reasonable enough to guarantee that the rights of access they grant are effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that although this is not the subject of a direct amendment by Mrs Banotti, the Commission has difficulties with the amendment to Article 17 of the regulation proposed by the French Government. We have difficulties with this because we feel that this article places too much emphasis on the purely intergovernmental origins of judicial cooperation. It is worth saying, however, that the issue of civil judicial cooperation was communitised by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Therefore, the functioning of the committee that Article 17 is challenging should not be purely intergovernmental. The Commission should play a more active role, as it does with regard to the European judicial network in civil matters, an issue which has, in fact, been submitted for the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that I am convinced that, with the adoption of this regulation that has a limited range but which is of symbolic value and important practical application, I am convinced, I repeat, that we are taking an initial, important step towards bringing the European Union closer to the citizens, particularly those citizens who, because of the circumstances of their lives, have had the misfortune to experience the tragedy of separation or divorce, which is always a tragedy, but which should certainly not have repercussions for every child’s right to happiness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point about the one day clearly refers to people who often travel right across the world to see a child. There is a problem in a situation like that, if they are only allowed twenty minutes access to the child. I think if there is a fear of abduction this can be handled by having supervised visitation. I feel very strongly that we have to in some way ensure that the rights of these parents, of whom there are quite a lot, are respected.</p>

The Commission feels that the Treaty establishing the European Community that is currently in force enables account to be taken of the specific nature of sport in general and of its social function in particular. The European Parliament’s statements on this matter and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, confirm the validity of the approach adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless true that the enormous dynamic of the Single Market and the increasing commercialisation of sporting activities have caused a number of legal conflicts in this field. Certain sports organisations claim that these conflicts can only be resolved by the inclusion of a reference to sport in the Treaty. The Commission does not fully share this view. With regard to the proposals submitted by the major federations for certain sports, which are in support of a protocol that would exempt them from complying with some of the Treaty’s basic rules, specifically those relating to free movement and to competition, it must be emphasised that this kind of exemption would, if we accept this definition of it, clearly be out of step with all of the objectives we are seeking to achieve. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether such an exemption could even be effectively put into practice. Sport these days – and this needs to be said – is closely bound up with other economic sectors, such as the audiovisual sector or the sector of the promotion and sale of sporting products, for example. What is more, such an exemption would, at worst, not even allow Community actions for the promotion of sport. Other equally important sports organisations, however, such as the national Olympic committees, for example, or national sports federations, have specifically insisted on the need to develop Community actions for the promotion of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, since the adoption of its opinion on the content of the current Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission has advocated that the Conference should focus on addressing institutional issues, which will enable it to take the process of enlargement forwards. This is why the Commission did not include in its opinion any request for new rules on Community competence, for example in the field of sport. In order to further highlight the specific nature of sport and even to provide guidance for the Community institutions on how to deal with sports-related issues, at the behest of the French Presidency, a draft declaration for the Nice European Council is now being prepared which would complement the conclusions of the Santa Maria da Feira European Council on this subject. The Commission hopes that such a declaration appended to the Nice Treaty will make it possible to take the work that has been started with sports bodies further, enabling them to adapt to the new economic climate but at the same time preserving the fundamental nature of their activities. As this Parliament stressed in the Mennea report on the report for the Helsinki Council, this would be carried out in full respect of the Community’s legislative framework. It is in this spirit, Mr President, that the Commission will continue the intense dialogue that it has maintained over the last few months with the sports movement as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recognise their commitment and determination to do that and, of course, that sport and especially football are big business and cannot expect to be exempt from the normal rules of business.</p>
<p class="contents">I am far from convinced that the football transfer system should be at the top of the Commission's hit list at the present time. It would be very prudent for the Commission to allow plenty of time for this, to allow it to go into extra time, not just so that we get a result but that we get a good result, a result that would be good for the single market and good for football.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that FIFA have played for time already and has waited far too long before coming up with any response to the Commission's formal statement issued back in 1998. In many respects they have only themselves to blame for the present situation. However, let us not forget that football is of crucial interest to millions of our citizens. As a famous English footballer, Jackie Charlton, said, it is not just a matter of life and death; it is more important than that. The EU must not shrug its shoulders and say <span class="italic">"tant pis"</span> if banning the transfer system does irreparable harm to football.</p>
<p class="contents">Many small clubs depend on the revenue stream that comes from transfer fees. The transfer fee is not just a wealth distributor, it is a wealth retainer. If transfers go, then what is to stop the upward spiral of footballers' wages? The manufacturers of Alfa Romeos may do very well, but that money will be lost to football.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly agree with the Commission that there is no need to have a mention of sport in the Treaty. What we need is an intelligent and flexible way of interpreting the present rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to negotiate positively with the national and international football authorities. I suggest that the Commission give much higher priority to other abuses of the single market for instance, the parallel import of designer goods. I would like to see much more effective moves to create a single market for newspapers and journals across Europe. The car industry too is still full of obstacles to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest to the Commission it puts those at the top of its list and does not allow football to become an own goal for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also really very glad that Commissioner Vitorino delivered this speech on the special features of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, unfortunately, sport still does not have a legal basis in the European Union, it has many special features that must be taken into account in the work of the Union. This is the direction it has been going in since Amsterdam. Sport affects all the citizens of Europe, in one way or another. It has been estimated that a hundred million people take an active interest in it in the European Union. Sport has many important social, cultural and, besides, very significant economic dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very positive sign that the Union’s sports ministers would like a statement made at the Nice Summit that would act as an extension to the Helsinki report that came out a little under a year ago. As the purpose is to determine those ways in which matters of sport can be taken into account in community legislation, we may speak of gradual progress made in this important area. The agenda before us is totally acceptable. Special attention must be paid to the system of player transfers and the protection of young sportsmen and women, the role of national sports federations, club ownership, television rights, sport’s civic work and ethical principles.</p>
<p class="contents">As we shape the EU’s policy on sports, we have to take account of sport’s different structures. For that reason, I hope that non-governmental sporting organisations will continue to be heard after the Olympics meeting in 1999. At the same time we have to remember that, although many questions that require us to take a stand are connected with the professional and commercial aspects of sport, sport and exercise have a wider significance than this with regard to individuals and society. We have to pay attention, for example, to young people’s opportunities to take up exercise as well as issues of gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has often expressed its concern with regard to drugs and called for more effective action to counter their use. It is gratifying, therefore, that the Community’s extent of involvement in WADA (<span class="italic">World Anti-Doping Agency</span>) and in its financing is now being clarified. This issue was discussed by Coreper on Wednesday. It is only natural that the member of the Commission responsible for sports should represent the Union in WADA in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, to put it plainly, it is the consequence of an attack on democracy, however hard we try to avoid seeing it in this light.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the problems that we have experienced and that have leapt into the centre of the debate, particularly following the Bosman ruling, even when they are neither directly nor indirectly connected to the content or the nature of that case, result from the frequent and sometimes glaring contradiction between on the one hand, specific types of sporting bodies and their deeply ingrained practices, and on the other, certain rules contained in the Treaties, specifically competition rules or other principles of the internal market, particularly the free movement of workers and rules of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these rules are amongst the oldest in the Treaties, from the Treaty of Rome onwards, despite the amendments that they have undergone. We all know, however, that when they were originally defined, or even when amendments were added at a later date, no one, but no one, not even those drafting them or those who took the decisions, thought for a moment that a current legal framework would hang this truly imperial weight around the neck of the sporting world.</p>
<p class="contents">I was talking about the economy and just the economy, in the strictest sense of the word. Not throughout society, because in all sectors we can see windows of economic opportunity. This is what I mean when I talk about a law without a policy. A law which was drawn up without participation, this absurd law that nobody really wanted to be like this but which has been inexcusably foisted onto everyone. This is why it is crucial that the Treaties recognise the specific nature of sport. Otherwise, no problem will find a satisfactory solution. Otherwise, we will continue to stand by helplessly in this situation in which it seems that the European Union and lucre are working hand in hand to put an end to sport, to distort the profound nature of sporting competition itself, to sabotage the social roots of clubs and the national fabric of its traditional organisation. Otherwise, sport will continue to be regularly trampled upon with inexplicable legal violence by the corrosive and destructive effects of rules that were not designed for this purpose and about which in truth no one really had any choice or could vote on to any degree. We are not seeking to meddle with fundamental rules or basic principles of Community law in the Treaties. What we want is to be able to construct in a politically free and carefully considered way a balance which is appropriate to the specific needs of a sector which, although it is of primarily cultural value and enormous social relevance, also has other, economic, facets.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be able to protect the sporting authenticity of sport itself and its social function from the exclusive control of the laws of the market. I repeat: we need to protect sport, not to abandon it. Why should we allow the basic fabric of training within the rich tapestry of sports clubs and associations to be abused? Why are we unable or unwilling to allow safeguards for a minimum of national identity in the professional teams that represent clubs? In sport, even in professional sport, the competition that really counts is the sporting competition itself, not just the unbridled economic competition of its agents. Furthermore, in European sport, there is not, nor should there be a true single market. What we have are fifteen national markets which are all different and which mirror the competitive situations in each country. This is even more true if we look at the specific case of the United Kingdom, which, together with other, equally European countries which happen to be outside the European Union, makes up the basic pool for long-established European competitions. Now, however, what is happening is completely the opposite. The growing inequality in wealth lays down the law and increasingly decides who wins all the trophies. The corruption of the authenticity of long-standing tradition has cemented the tendency and the pressures of the power of money, aided kindly by a poorly understood Community legal framework, to destroy everything that is of real cultural value and impose a single market of closed leagues and a money-obsessed spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end with a reminder of one of the conclusions of the resolution that we voted for in September following the Mennea report: “The European Parliament invites the Intergovernmental Conference to include an explicit reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty, so that the European Union will, in its actions, acknowledge the cultural, economic and social phenomenon that sport represents”. Perhaps we are still in time. I appeal to the forthcoming IGC not to be another wasted opportunity for sport. In particular, I urge the French Government not to reject at Nice the words and guarantees that President Chirac gave us here in July. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the plans announced is the introduction of some form of road user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers, British and non-British alike, for their use of the road network in the UK. Provided that the details of its implementation respect the relevant rules, such a measure seems to be in line with current Community law which aims at the elimination of distortion of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and at harmonisation of levy systems within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the EU directive governing this field, which was adopted unanimously in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply user charges or motorway tolls. Accordingly, six Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden introduced a common user charge system often called the euro-vignette while Austria continued to apply its own user charge system and France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece maintained their already existing motorway toll system. This means that by 1995 12 out of the 15 Member States had adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis on direct charging and less on taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which also give an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of road networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures announced by the UK signal such a readjustment of its charging system. However, the whole package of measures announced also includes other elements such as a reduction in the fuel taxes, similar to measures recently announced by other Member States. All these measures are presently the subject of an examination by the Commission responsible under the EU Treaty for ensuring the consistency and coordination of national activities within the common transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore expecting to receive shortly a reply to its request for detailed information on the measures planned by the UK government. The Commission will then have to investigate, as it does in the case of all other Member States, whether or not such measures are likely to distort intra-Community competition. Depending on the outcome of this analysis, the Commission will decide on the next course of action in fulfilling its role of assisting Member States in taking the measures which are right for them and while respecting the rights of others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What he said is news to me because my understanding was that the proposal was a special tax on all foreign vehicles, which we assumed was all non-UK vehicles using the roads of the United Kingdom. I see this as a political gesture rather than as a political or fiscal measure. My understanding is that costs in the UK, taking into account the new proposals, without this particular charge are on a par with the rest of the European Union and on a similar level to French transport costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the Commission says that a country may introduce that charge and put the same charge on its own vehicles, I still regard it as a distortion of the single market because presumably British hauliers will apply for their tax disc and every charge will be included in the single payment that they will make. Other users of British roads will be required to pay a special tax at the border on entry into the United Kingdom. No matter what the Commission thinks, this is a distortion of the single market and a distortion of free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is particularly hard and vexatious for Ireland. Ireland, is obviously a very small but open market, yet most of what we buy comes from the United Kingdom. We buy GBP 11,000 million worth of goods from Britain annually as against only GBP 7,000 million from the rest of the European Union. That shows the extent to which Irish industry and commerce favour the British market, although with the current strength of the pound sterling, this situation will not be maintained if the value of the currency does not change. At the moment every Irish citizen buys EUR 5,000 of goods from Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this measure is certainly contrary to free trade even with the improvement that has been mentioned by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement and the facts that he confirmed. It may be advantageous at this moment just to say what has actually been proposed by the UK government and also what they are proposing, bearing in mind the crisis in Britain and indeed throughout the whole of the European Union with regard to the road haulage industry.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said at the outset that this is not just a specific British problem. The proposal was put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a pre-budget statement made six months before the full budget statement made in the spring of 2001. It contained a number of proposals, not just specifically this one on the vignette, which will effect the haulage industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure my Irish colleagues that the vignette proposal is being made in full cognisance of the euro-vignette directive and is likely to be along similar lines to those already in place, as Commissioner Vitorino explained, in many of the present Member States of the European Union. It is worth pointing out that at the moment lorries from the United Kingdom are faced with vignette or toll charges on roads in other EU Member States but so far such levies have not been charged within the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the United Kingdom government will be responding to the Commission's request in discussions with the Commission as well as the haulage industry to explore ways in which the vignette scheme can operate within the present euro-vignette directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The details of our scheme have yet to be put in place. I understand Mr McCartin's concerns, but it seems to me that a lot of what is being said about the UK system is based not on fact but on rumour and things that are being said in the industry rather than things that have been proposed by the UK government.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the UK government want to consult with hauliers and I also know that the UK government recognises the specific position of Ireland and I am sure that it will be talking to its counterparts in Dublin as well as in Belfast.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to get clear today is that the UK is proposing what it is doing in full recognition that it must consult the European Union and in full recognition that there is EU legislation in place that it must abide by. It also recognises that if it charges the euro-vignette system then it will also have to charge similar amounts to its own UK hauliers. It recognises that whatever scheme it brings in must be non-discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are being premature in the European Parliament in holding this debate, but I welcome the fact and the statement from Commissioner Vitorino which clearly indicates that the UK government has the right to introduce a euro-vignette system provided it keeps within the rules and regulations already in place. I believe that is what the UK government wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not take this debate as premature at all. When an important proposal of this kind comes forward we, in this House, should have the chance to think about it and discuss it as early as possible, not necessarily for the last time.</p>
<p class="contents">Like him, however, I was very grateful to the Commissioner for the extremely clear statement of the conditions in which charges of this kind would be lawful under Community law and of the real possibility that what we are facing here is not just a dodge to get out of an awkward corner, but a proposal that will fulfil Community law. Again, I thought that what Mr Simpson said was extremely helpful in reassuring us about the probable intentions of the UK government.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to respond to Mr McCartin's remarks. British trade is important to Ireland but it is true the other way round as well. For example, the economy of south west Scotland around Stranraer and Loch Ryan is heavily dependent on the traffic which comes across the north channel, the shortest crossing between the UK and Ireland. Our people depend very heavily on that trade. I would like to say that it would be disgraceful if we were to introduce a vignette which is supposed to support the infrastructure but do not then use it to improve the infrastructure. The condition of the road leading from south west Scotland into the main motorway network, the A75, is disgraceful at the moment. This might give us an opportunity at last to see a real and sustained improvement of the transport facilities which connect our two economies. I very much hope that will be one result of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has already submitted an excellent Green Paper concerning fair prices on the roads, and an important principle of this Green Paper is that there should be no cross-subsidising of road hauliers and that, above all, the money collected from particular roads should be used to solve the problems on these same roads.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also quite clearly ascertained that the greatest problem on the roads at present is accidents. Safe and well constructed roads are an important and basic prerequisite for preventing accidents. At present in Europe, we have approximately 50 000 deaths on the road each year. Very many people die not least because of poor and badly signposted roads with poor visibility on which people drive with a bad mental attitude, and it costs our social systems a very great deal of money to deal with the resulting damage to people’s well-being. Precautionary measures are therefore required in this area. We should see to it that people are safe on the roads and, in the interests of the environment in particular, we must ensure that congestion is prevented. Not only is a lot of time lost and high costs incurred through congestion, but it is quite a major problem for the environment in particular, and I therefore believe that, if the British government is actually investing money in solving the problems, then we all have something to gain, particularly all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was in this House on Monday night when the agenda was agreed by this body. The item was not agreed for the agenda. Later on, when one of our colleagues, Mrs Doyle, raised the issue, all of a sudden the President decided that this issue should go on to the agenda. That is not a democratic and fair way of drawing up this House's agenda. This House draws up the agenda, not the President at the whim of one Member. I also notice that Mrs Doyle is not here today to take part in this. That said, I will go on to talk about the subject in question.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we had a debate on the subject. I listened to Mr McCartin earlier and it is evident he has got the wrong end of the stick. This is not discriminating against every other driver or road haulier in Europe to the benefit of British drivers. This applies to all road hauliers, whether they come from the UK or any other country. That should be made quite clear. Also, the details are yet to be fully worked out but I was quite heartened to hear the statement from the Commissioner about how it is going to be proposed and developed. I am sure the British government will be in discussion with the Commission in applying this vignette.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to pick up on a point raised by Mr MacCormick. He talked about the trade between Ireland and Scotland, the south west of Scotland, coming over to Stranraer and Loch Ryan. He said that he hoped the money raised by this vignette would go towards improving the infrastructure around the south west of Scotland. I know the south west of Scotland is part of my area and yes, the infrastructure there is not the best, it can be improved. But can I point out to Mr MacCormick that this vignette is for the whole of the UK. It is to improve the road structure throughout the whole of the UK. We cannot take one small area of the UK and say that is where it is going. It is for the whole of the UK. That is a point we should be making quite clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we face the highest petrol prices, the highest diesel prices of any country in Europe – GBP 1.20 a litre for diesel is paid in the United Kingdom. Vehicle excise duties are eight times the French level in the UK, so one should not be too surprised that in Britain there is a great deal of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As a British driver, when I go on French motorways I must pay French tolls. I might say that by the time I have arrived at Calais, having driven from Strasbourg, I feel I own the French motorway system, so expensive are those tolls. I drove in Austria in the summer and paid the Austrian vignette which seemed to me to be perfectly fair and reasonable and a much more agreeable price than one pays on French motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">My objection to this proposal is not that it is unfair. At long last the British government has come up with a reasonable solution. We in my party proposed it two years ago. The present British government has allowed the situation to get out of hand and it is rather late in the day for them to come up with this proposal which will probably take another two years to come into effect. If they do bring it into effect, we want to see them really pass the benefits on to the British road-users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The local haulier in Denmark or in the UK will get his full money's worth 365 days a year, but the foreign haulier from another Member State entering that country – maybe for one or two days or ten days or even 100 days – will not. He is paying over the odds for his vignette unless there is some special dispensation on a <span class="italic">per diem</span> basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be better now that we have arrived at this stage to think of maybe having a mutual recognition system, so that a vignette in one country is recognised in other countries, giving a real euro-vignette system works? The Commission should consider coming forward with proposals in order to provide for a common system throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn now to my friend Mr McCartin. I agree that Irish trucks have a special case. They are compelled by geography to pass through the UK just as British trucks are compelled to pass through the Netherlands, Belgium and France to get around the European Union. The best thing the UK could do to help the Irish and to help the Scottish is to improve the very inferior British motorway system on which we depend to get to our markets. Yes, the Stranraer-Carlisle road is an absolute disgrace. But it is also difficult getting round Birmingham, getting around London, getting to the Channel Tunnel and to the channel ports. The best thing the British could do with this extra money is to improve our system in the hope of improving UK-Irish friendship and relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Rural areas account for 80% of the EU's territory and 25% of its population. Rural depopulation is continuing, and, despite the Union's efforts to support rural development, the countryside remains at a severe disadvantage in terms of social, labour and human indicators by comparison with urban areas.</p>
<p>The closure of rural schools is in many cases not a consequence but a cause of depopulation. However, the successive rural development programmes have not used existing rural educational resources as dynamising agents: the Community programmes aimed at redressing imbalances in less-developed and more isolated areas have not interacted sufficiently with those aimed at improving the education and training levels of their inhabitants. By contrast, the use of the human and material resources of rural schools would require the mobilisation of key strategic factors for the realisation of EDRF and ESF objectives and, in general, those of all the various policies for regional cohesion in the Community.</p>

<p>Council Regulation (EC) No  of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), among the rural development measures eligible for cofinancing under the programmes presented by the Member States, provides for support for vocational training intended to contribute towards improving the vocational skills and competences of farmers or other persons involved in farming or forestry activities, and their retraining. This applies, for instance, to the implementation of production methods compatible with the upkeep and improvement of the landscape and environmental protection, or to gaining the level of professional qualification required to manage an economically viable farm.</p>
<p>The following are, however, explicitly excluded from support under Commission Regulation (EC) 1750/1999 of 23 July 1999: any educational or training courses which form part of the standard secondary or higher education curriculum in agriculture or forestry, and, in the programmes submitted to the Commission, Member States must, in addition to outlining the eligible schemes and beneficiaries, provide assurance that no standard educational programme or scheme is put forward for Community funding. The scope of these measures for the purposes of vocational training is therefore not the same as that of the Socrates Programme which the Council, in response to the Commission proposal, has just decided to renew.</p>
<p>Socrates, the Community’s action programme in the field of education, the second phase of which was established by decision No 253/2000/EC of the Parliament and the Council, seeks to contribute to the development of quality education by encouraging cooperation between the Member States and by supporting and supplementing their action. According to Article 149 (ex-Article 126) of the EC Treaty, the responsibility for the content of teaching and the organisation of the educational systems lies with the Member States.</p>
<p>The school education chapter of the programme, Comenius, aims at enhancing the quality and the European dimension of school education throughout the Community. Comenius targets all schools of the Member States, be they rural or urban, and it seeks to encourage transnational cooperation between schools, to contribute to improved professional development of staff in the school education sector, and to promote the learning of languages and intercultural awareness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0838"></a>

<p>The Commission has already had occasion to present its views on the conditions for the application of Structural Funds in the event of natural disasters in its statement to the European Parliament of 25 October 2000.<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>With regard to the resources of the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF), the Commission has not received any official requests from the authorities of either Spain or Italy with a view to reallocating resources from this fund following the recent natural disasters.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the Council Regulation on support for rural development<span class="sup">2<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></span> gives Member States the option of including in their rural development plans measures pursuant to the twelfth item of Article 33 on restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and introducing appropriate prevention instruments. A number of Spanish and Italian regional plans have indeed included a provision of this sort for the programming period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>EAGGF resources could consequently be set aside on this legal basis, on the proviso that they remained less than the financial contribution of each Member State. With regard to the regions affected, and in consideration of the extent of the damage, reprogramming within the limits of the available appropriations seems probable but must be submitted to the Commission for examination and, if necessary, approval.</p>
<p>With regard to the Community initiative Interreg III, there have been no specific requests from the Member States concerned. This does not, however, exclude the possibility that some action with regard to natural disasters, particularly with a view to prevention, may be included in the proposed programmes for sections A and B of Interreg III which are to be submitted to the Commission in the next few weeks. The Interreg programme cannot take actual expenses related to such action into consideration until the competent national and/or regional authorities present their proposed programmes.</p>
<p>More specifically regarding the Italian regions mentioned by the honourable Member, on 27 July 2000, the Commission finalised the list of Italian regions eligible for Structural Fund action under Objective 2 for the period 2000-2006. The regions of Trento, Piedmont, Val d’Aosta, Liguria and Lombardy, which were affected by the flooding in September and October, have not to date officially presented their Single Programming Document proposals under this objective. As soon as these proposals have been received, the Commission will assess the possibility of undertaking action in these areas along the lines already presented to the European Parliament on 25 October 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Since the honourable Member’s oral question was tabled, the Commission has implemented a raft of measures intended to improve the effectiveness of the provision of information, both centralised and decentralised.</p>
<p>Efficiency has been sought in the structures implemented in order to ensure cooperation and coordination. Coordination is effective at a number of levels:</p>
<p>-	At departmental level: regular meetings chaired by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs bring together the Commission departments directly or indirectly affected by the issue of the euro. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Parliament (EP) are invited to attend these meetings.</p>
<p>-	At the level of ECB and the Eurosystem (European System of Central Banks), the Commission monitors, as an observer, the meetings of the group responsible for monitoring and directing the euro information campaign. A monthly meeting is held in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>-	At Member State level, and, more specifically, at the level of ministries and other bodies responsible for conducting the euro information campaigns, meetings of the euro communication campaign directors are convened by the Commission (the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs). Five or six meetings are planned for next year. The last meeting, held on 23 and 24 October in Strasbourg, at the invitation of the European Parliament, made it possible to hear Mr Karas and Mrs Randzio-Plath speak, and also, for the first time, to bring together all the national and institutional operators involved in the euro information campaigns. Many Members of Parliament took part in this meeting. This experiment will be repeated in 2001, as it provides a useful opportunity to exchange ideas and experience informally and to involve the Members of Parliament. Another initiative, a scoreboard for the euro information campaigns being conducted in the Member States and by the Commission, will be drawn up and regularly updated. Details of this will be passed on to the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>-	At national level, the Commission representatives and Parliament services take part in euro committee meetings (or similar meetings).</p>
<p>-	At institutional level, the high level meeting between the European Parliament and the Commission provides the political forum for coordination.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress its determination to make every effort to ensure that the information on the euro provided by the various operators, our partners, is such as to overcome the lack of information noted today and to meet the expectations of citizens. Quite obviously, the role of the Member States is primordial and, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation, it falls to the national states to devote their own budget and human resources to ensuring that their nationals are informed to as high a degree as possible and trained regarding the euro.</p>
<p>The Commission will play its role of coordination and promotion to the full, but only to the extent that its abilities and powers allow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0803"></a>

<p>A serious oil spill has occurred off the island of Gotska Sandön, near Gotland in the Baltic, and the authorities have not – at least at the time of tabling this question – succeeded in ascertaining who caused it.</p>
<p>Several sources in the European media report that the oil spill, which occurred on Monday, 2 October 2000, has polluted some 90% of the island’s coast. The cleaning of the beach, which must of course begin without delay, will be extremely labour-intensive, because the island has no harbour and its coastal waters are shallow. The oil will have to be picked up by hand and taken back to the mainland.</p>
<p>The island, 3700 ha in area, has sandy beaches, and is known amongst other things for its 900 species of beetles, its plants and its grey seals. Fortunately no dead animals have yet been found on the islands. The timing of the accident was also fortunate in that most of the birds have already migrated. However, the oil presents a threat to the bird species which remain on the island.</p>
<p>What measures does the Commission propose to take to ensure that the person responsible for the oil spill off the coast of Gotska Sandön is found out as soon as possible and brought to justice?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The response to be given to marine pollution incidents primarily falls under the responsibility of the affected Member State.</p>
<p>In the field of accidental marine pollution, a Community action plan has been developed since 1978. The major elements of this plan are joint training initiatives, pilot projects for the development of combating means, the provision and exchange of information, and a task force including designated experts from the Member States, which is activated in case of accident.</p>
<p>A new decision setting up a Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental or deliberate marine pollution should soon be finalised by Parliament and the Council. This instrument will not only bring together and consolidate the different actions carried out until now in the field of accidental pollution, but also include Community cooperation in the field of deliberate pollution at sea, in particular concerning operational spills from vessels. The financial reference for this amount for this decision for the period 2000 to 2006 is set at EUR 7 million. Once the decision is adopted, the Commission will propose concrete initiatives to be developed under this new Community framework. Such measures should in particular address reinforced cooperation in order to improve the identification of contravening vessels and further exchange of information on the efficiency of the prosecution systems applied in the different Member States. This will create synergies at Community level and should ultimately permit the application of dissuasive sanctions against the parties responsible for such criminal acts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0825"></a>

<p>According to the Commission, the Netherlands failed to take appropriate measures with regard to the management of the cockle and mussel fishery in the Wadden Sea – designated as a special protection area under Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds – to ensure that the quality of the habitats of certain bird species does not deteriorate and that no significant disturbance occurs for those species, as required in Article 4(4) of Directive 79/409/EEC. The size of the area closed to the fishery was too small and limiting fishery to a level at which only at least 60% of the food requirements in the form of cockles and mussels remains available for birds in years of food shortage was considered to be insufficient.</p>
<p>The Netherlands failed to reply to both the letter of formal notice (sent 16 January 1996) and to the reasoned opinion (sent 23 September 1997). For this reason the Commission decided to take the case to the Court of Justice on 2 March 1998 (case registered by the Court under C-63/98).</p>
<p>Within the context of the Court proceedings the Netherlands responded for the first time to the allegations made in the case. This led to the Commission withdrawing the case since the substantive information provided by the Dutch authorities had to be taken into account. As a result, the allegations mentioned in the letter of formal notice and the reasoned opinion could not be considered any longer as sufficient to demonstrate a causal relationship between the fishery and possible effects on the birds, particularly since those allegations related to the period from 1993 and the Dutch shell fishery policy was under review. The Commission by letter of 30 November 1998 requested the Court to withdraw the case. By decision of 4 May 1999 the Chairman of the Court decided to delete the case. The Netherlands was condemned to pay the costs as it had failed to reply to the reasoned opinion in time which led to the Commission taking the case to the Court.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0833"></a>

<p>The Danube pollution caused by a cyanide spill following a damburst of a tailings pond in Baia Mare/Romania and an accident that occurred in 1998 in Aznalcóllar/Spain where a damburst poisoned the environment of the Coto Doñana National Park have increased public awareness of the environmental and safety hazards of mining activities and have also raised the question of the effectiveness of Community policies intended to prevent such disasters.</p>
<p>On 23 October 2000, the Commission adopted a communication on the "Safe operation of mining activities: a follow-up to recent mining accidents" (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0664">COM(2000) 664</a> final). This Communication describes the steps that the Commission envisages to take as a follow-up to recent mining accidents, as announced in its Communication of 3 May 2000 on Promoting sustainable development in the EU non-energy extractive industry (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0265">COM(2000) 265</a> final).</p>
<p>With regard to possible initiatives in the framework of Community environmental legislation, the Communication sets out three priority actions envisaged to improve the safety of mines. They relate to industrial risk management, management of mining waste and integrated pollution prevention and control:</p>
<p>-	amendment of the Seveso II Directive (96/82/EC) to include mineral processing of ores and, in particular, tailings ponds or dams used in connection with such mineral processing of ores. Industrial operators performing these activities would thus be obliged to put into effect Safety Management Systems, including a detailed risk assessment on the basis of possible accident scenarios (proposal foreseen by mid-2001);</p>
<p>-	an initiative on the management of mining waste. This initiative will take into account the results of a study launched by the Commission on the existing legislation and practices concerning the management of waste from the extractive industry. The study is to be completed by the end of 2000 for the 15 Member States and by mid-2001 for the candidate countries. The initiative on waste management will cover the environmental issues of the management of mining waste as well as the best practices, which could prevent environmental damage during the waste management.</p>
<p>-	a reference document (BREF) under the Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) Directive (96/61/EC) describing the Best Available Techniques (BAT) to reduce everyday pollution and to prevent or mitigate accidents in the non-ferrous metals mining sector. This document would provide guidance and address both industry as well as the Member States' authorities responsible for issuing permits under the IPPC Directive.</p>
<p>These initiatives will be prepared in close cooperation with the candidate countries for accession to the Community. The Communication and the priority actions identified will constitute an important input to the ongoing work of the Baia Mare Task Force (BMFT), an international task force set up to examine the causes and consequences of the cyanide spill into the Danube, to propose remedial actions and to identify other high risk installations in the area, to avoid similar accidents in future. The BMFT will present its Final Report to the member of the Commission in charge of Environment on 15 December 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0843"></a>

<p>The Commission initiated the Article 88(2) (ex-Article 93) of the Treaty procedure against the Swedish reduced social contributions scheme, because it has doubts as to its compatibility with Community State aid rules.</p>
<p>As pointed out, the low population density regions covered by the scheme are severely affected by high transport costs. This is why the Guidelines on national regional aid allow Member States to provide transport aid in such areas. In order to avoid abuse, the Guidelines provide that transport aid should be granted exclusively in relation to the extra costs of transport of goods incurred by companies located in low population density areas. They also provide that there should never be overcompensation of the extra transport costs.</p>
<p>A company's social security contribution is a function of the size of its workforce, and not of the extra transport costs it has incurred. There is therefore no link between the aid under the scheme and the extra transport costs incurred by the beneficiaries. This also means that there is no guarantee that there is no overcompensation of the extra transport costs. In view of this, the Commission maintains its doubts as to whether the scheme is in conformity with the regional aid guidelines.</p>
<p>The honourable Members draw the Commission's attention to the fact that Norway operates a similar aid scheme in its low population density regions. The Commission is aware of the existence of this scheme. The Norwegian scheme was approved by ESA in 1997. Following the opening of the Article 88(2) procedure against the Swedish Reduced social contributions scheme, the Commission has taken up the issue with the European free trade area (EFTA) Surveillance Authority. When the Commission has taken its final decision on the Swedish scheme, it will examine with the EFTA Surveillance Authority how best to proceed to ensure that State aid rules are implemented in a consistent manner throughout the entire European Economic Area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0841"></a>

<p>Further to the Commission's answer to my question of 16 May 2000 and to the positions taken by the Commission in the intervening period, it appears to be agreed in principle that, by virtue of the internal electricity market, electricity generated from nuclear power is subject to the State aid rules laid down in the EC Treaty and that the only State aid provided for in the Euratom Treaty relates to research and, possibly, investment. Can the Commission confirm that it would conclude from this interpretation that investment aid to nuclear power is regulated by the Euratom Treaty but that operating aid is subject to the State aid rules laid down in the EC Treaty. Has the Commission notified the Member States of its conclusions in this respect and sought notification of all operating State aid? Furthermore, since Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty refers to measures necessary to facilitate the conclusion of insurance contracts covering nuclear risks but does not provide for an operating subsidy for this purpose, can the Commission now confirm that it is investigating such State aid to the nuclear industry as requested by the Greens EFA Group in its letter dated 10 March 2000 to Commissioner Monti?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member’s opinion regarding the need to create conditions favourable to the development of renewable energies and the cogeneration of heat and power. That is why the new draft framework for State aid in favour of the environment stipulates the possibility of granting aid according to the following conditions:</p>
<p>For renewable energies, investment aid is possible at the base rate of 40 % of the eligible costs. This base rate may be incremented by bonuses of 10 % for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), if the investment is to enable the supply of an entire community, such as, for instance, an island, as well as for businesses established in the regions eligible for regional aid.</p>
<p>Member States may, moreover, grant operating aid in accordance with several options.</p>
<p>In the first place, they may grant aid for a limited time period of 5 years, in principle to be degressive, according to the conditions applying to operating aid.</p>
<p>They may also grant aid intended to compensate for the difference between renewable energy production costs and the market price for electricity. Such aid is not limited in time but must cease when the investment has been written off. If necessary, financial costs and the reasonable remuneration of capital may possibly be taken into account in the amount of the investment.</p>
<p>Member States may also grant aid by using market mechanisms such as ‘green certificates’. Such aid may be authorised if it is essential in order to ensure the viability of renewable energies. It must not, however, lead to widespread overcompensation and must not serve to deter renewable energy producers from striving to increase their competitiveness.</p>
<p>For combined power and heat production, investment aid is possible at the base rate of 30 %, to which the same bonuses should be added as for renewable energies.</p>
<p>For cogeneration, operating aid is also provided for on the same conditions as for renewable energies, if the Member States can clearly demonstrate the need for this aid.</p>
<p>The Commission considers this to be a generous approach in terms of state aid, but one that is justified by the need to enable the Member States to take every possible measure to develop energies that are environmentally friendly and, in particular, in order to achieve the objectives of the proposed Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources as well as the objectives set out in the Commission communication on cogeneration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0789"></a>

<p>Socotra is one of the most precious natural assets, not only for the Republic of Yemen but for mankind. It has been designated as a ‘World Heritage Site’ and a ‘Man and Biosphere reserve’ by UNESCO. The Yemenite Government has declared it a ‘Special Protected area’.</p>
<p>The outstanding plant bio-diversity of Socotra, and its rich marine environment are of global significance, and must be preserved. But we must also be able to attend the basic needs of the people who live there, and to give them a chance to enjoy all the benefits of modern society without damaging their fragile environment.</p>
<p>The Government of Yemen has recognised the need to formulate a master plan for the sustainable development of Socotra and has requested assistance in this task from the Commission. In recognition of the global value of these islands the Commission has agreed to provide up to 995 000 euros for the establishment of the Socotra Archipelago master plan. The project is presently undertaken by a consortium of European and Yemen consultants. The project which aims at striking the right balance between conservation and development, has just increased its second phase and will be completed early 2001.</p>
<p>The Master Plan will set out a programme for the economic and social development of the Archipelago during the period 2001-2010. This phased programme will include social, economic, financial, and environmental aspects. The Master plan must fully take into consideration the Archipelago’s presently particularly low level of development and its outstanding environmental assets and conservation policies. These latter are contained in the “Zoning Plan for Socotra Archipelago for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Bio-diversity and Natural Resources” which was prepared with the assistance of (UNDP) and recently approved by the Yemenite Government.</p>
<p>The recent Red Sea dispute with Eritrea made the Yemeni Government aware of the importance of fostering economic development in the Socotra Archipelago. At the same time it recognised the need to take adequate measures to protect the unique and valuable flora and fauna of the archipelago, in the interest of the local population as well as of the international community. Uncontrolled development would cause irreparable damage and thus be counterproductive in the long term. In agreeing to provide funding for the master plan study the Commission therefore aimed to support a balanced approach by the Yemeni authorities to the development of the Socotra Archipelago, giving equal importance to the needs of the local population and the protection of the habitat and natural resources of the islands. Only through such a comprehensive set of policies can the overall objective of sustainable development in the Archipelago be achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0791"></a>

<p>As per its announcement to the plenary sitting of the European Parliament of 5 October 2000, during the topical and urgent debate on the subject of the shipwreck of the Samina, the Commission will in 2001 look into all the safety regulations covered by Directive 98/18/EC, particularly the issue of an age limit on ships and the exemption which applies to some Greek ships.</p>
<p>As regards the second part of the question, the Commission wishes to check that Directive 98/18 was indeed transposed by Greece in 1999 by Presidential Decree 103/99. This decree stipulates that all passenger vessels must have safety certificates. Given that the practical application of Community directives continues to be the exclusive responsibility of Member States, the Commission does not at this stage have information regarding Greece’s implementation of the directive.</p>
<p>After the wreck of the Samina, however, the Commission sent a letter to the Greek Government expressly asking for copies of the ship’s safety certificates as issued by the Greek authorities. It also requested evidence that the other provisions of Community legislation as applicable to passenger vessels had been complied with, namely the 1995 regulation on the safety management of ro-ro passenger vessels<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the 1998 Directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships<a href="#defann_17_4" name="refann_17_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the 1994 Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers<a href="#defann_17_5" name="refann_17_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that certain provisions of Directive 98/18/EC were to have been applied by 1 October 2000 at the latest, the Commission asked the Greek Government for confirmation that, as of this date, all passenger ships providing domestic services in Greece – except those covered by the exemption under Decision 1999/461/EC – have been operating in accordance with the relevant terms of Directive 98/18/EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with the principle governing the single market, private individuals may purchase goods tax-paid in one Member State, and then transport them to their own Member State without such goods being liable to further taxation there. In the case of products subject to excise duty, such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages, the same principle applies, provided that the products are purchased for personal use and are transported by the purchaser.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether products subject to excise duty are being held for commercial purposes rather than for personal use, Member States are authorised to consider various evidential factors, such as:</p>
<p>the commercial status and motives of the person holding the products,</p>
<p>the place where the products are located or the mode of transport used,</p>
<p>any documents relating to the products, and</p>
<p>the quantity of the products.</p>
<p>Where the last factor is concerned, the Member States are authorised to lay down, solely as an evidential factor, indicative levels which in no circumstances may be lower than those laid down in the directive (e.g. 800 cigarettes, 90 litres of wine, 10 litres of spirits).</p>
<p>It is only after considering all the factors referred to that the Member States may decide whether a person's transporting of products subject to excise duty should be deemed to be commercial in nature. Consequently, consideration solely of the information relating to quantities can never be sufficient on its own.</p>
<p>This administrative approach is clearly derived from Community rules. Moreover, whenever the Commission has been informed of situations in which the importing of products subject to excise duty by individual persons has been interpreted too restrictively at national level, it has immediately called upon the Member State concerned to change its administrative practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0802"></a>

<p>In March 2000, the US State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs published a report entitled 'International Narcotics Control Strategy Report' which states (verbatim) that 'the flow to Europe (from Turkey) has remained steady for the last two years at between four and six tons of heroin each month.' The report describes Turkey as the foremost transit centre for hard drugs and as 'one of the world's two traditional opium growing countries, as recognised by the U.S. government and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). What is the Commission's position on this vast flow of drugs from a country which is an applicant for accession to the Union? What monitoring mechanisms and sanctions has it adopted? What measures does it intend to take to put an end to the activities of the international gangs which smuggle drugs from Turkey into the Member States of the Union? Has the Commission taken up the entire issue with the Turkish authorities who are calling for closer relations between their country and the Union, while dozens of tons of heroin and other narcotic substances pour into Europe from Turkey every year? Finally, will the criteria for Turkey's accession to the European Union also include a drastic reduction in drug trafficking and will the pre-accession partnership agreement incorporate a provision to that effect ?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its 1999 Regular Report on Turkey’s progress towards accession, the Commission considers that "Turkey remains a major trafficking centre, particularly for drugs coming from Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. It is also a centre for refining opium.”</p>
<p>It continues by saying: "The Turkish authorities need to devote attention to dismantling hidden laboratories and combating the chain of trafficking more effectively. Greater efficiency will require significant reinforcement of police cooperation with EU Member States, an area hitherto marked by insufficient exchanges of information. The Turkish authorities will have to acquire legal instruments, which are compatible with international police cooperation practices, particularly in connection with controlled delivery".</p>
<p>The fight against drug-trafficking was one of the fields covered by Union experts during the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Mission which took place last September over two weeks in Turkey. This mission was very similar to those that were organised in the other candidate countries and intended to identify major differences between Turkish and Union legislation and practices in the JHA field. This should be considered as a first step in the cooperation process that is being established in this field in the context of Turkey’s preparation for accession.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the fight against drugs will be clearly a priority in view of Turkey’s accession. This will be done through promotion of and support for the development of a comprehensive and multidisciplinary response to the drug phenomenon at a national level as well as through furthering the cooperation with Member States and other candidates countries in the field of drug information, drug supply and demand reduction.</p>
<p>The Commission is also cofinancing the Joint United Nations international drug control programme (UNDCP)-PHARE drug law enforcement programme for South-eastern Europe which aims at improving the efficiency of the fight against illicit drug trafficking in this region by strengthening the law enforcement capacity of Bulgaria, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Romania. This should reduce the activities of the international gangs which smuggle drugs from Turkey into the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently participated in a meeting in Turkey which set up an international monitoring programme aimed at preventing the diversion of acetic anhydride, the major chemical used in the illicit manufacture of heroin. This chemical is already under international control but it is hoped that the further measures that will be taken by participants in the operation (Operation Topaz) will significantly reduce its diversion.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important not to confuse illicit production with traditional and legal opium production in Turkey which is monitored by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0805"></a>

<p>There are no official statistics for European airlines on cases where passengers have been denied boarding due to overbooking. The estimates available to the Commission indicate that approximately one in a thousand passengers is affected within the Community. In order to remedy this lack of information and to thereby enable passengers to make a better informed choice of air companies, the Commission intends to encourage the publication, for the benefit of consumers, of reports comparing the performance of different transport companies within the Community. These reports would cover the matter of passengers not being allowed to board, but also other aspects of the service, such as punctuality.

<p>Denial of boarding due to overbooking causes considerable delays in travel and serious inconvenience to passengers.

<p>In bringing forward this proposal to recast three existing directives on tobacco, account has been taken of experience with their application and of scientific facts which have appeared since the adoption of the directives in 1989, 1990 and 1992 respectively. On the advice of its scientific advisory committee for cancer prevention, a number of other areas were also considered, and a survey carried out of potential internal market implications. A Commission report from last September sets out a detailed analysis of these matters and a specific assessment form analysing the economic impact of the proposal has been attached to the proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the trade in tobacco products is of sufficient importance to justify continued concern for the abolition of actual or potential obstacles to the achievement of the internal market. The proposed directive covers all products imported into or manufactured in the Community, thus ensuring neutrality of treatment. All products manufactured in the Community need to be covered, whether domestically consumed or exported, to ensure that the rules set up to ensure the smooth operation of the internal market are not undermined by parallel trade. Unfortunately, tobacco products are a highly smuggled commodity. If different product rules were applied for domestic and exported products, the Commission could not be sure that a high level of public health protection could be assured, as Article 95 (ex-Article 100 A) of the EC Treaty requires.</p>
<p>As regards exports, the reports of the effects of applying the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ceilings to exports are greatly exaggerated. The Commission does not believe that there is a genuine market demand abroad for more dangerous products which would be banned for health reasons on the Community market. It would recall that on previous occasions, the threat of job losses was invoked, but that in practice the greatest job losses have been due to rationalisation in the tobacco industry itself.</p>
<p>When the 1990 Tar Directive was being considered, books and pamphlets were published to argue that that directive would result in considerable employment losses in the Community, a forecast which has happily proved completely unfounded. The same applies to exports in the proposed directive: there is no evidence of a market demand for more dangerous tobacco products. Lastly, on this point, the negotiation of a World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control was the subject of a Council negotiating mandate to the Commission in October 1999 on the basis of Article 300 (ex-Article 228) of the Treaty. The negotiations on this convention envisage the creation of international tobacco product regulation, which underlines the Commission’s view that the present proposal for a directive is going in the right legal, trade and ethical direction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0821"></a>

<p>The honourable Member has raised a particularly important and serious issue, namely the problem of taxpayers who move to another Member State without paying their outstanding tax debts in their Member State of origin.</p>
<p>While the Commission welcomes the increased mobility of Union citizens who are reaping the full benefits of the Single Market, it also recognises the scope for tax avoidance and evasion this creates. The Commission acknowledges the legitimate needs of Member States to maintain their tax revenues and has presented a number of initiatives aimed at combating tax avoidance and evasion within the Community</p>
<p>In the direct tax area, the Council is currently discussing a package to tackle harmful tax competition, consisting of a code of conduct for business taxation<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>, a proposal for a directive on taxation of savings<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 2</span> and a proposal for a directive on interest and royalty payments<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span>. The Commission has also been actively involved in the work of the Ad hoc Group on Tax Fraud, which presented its final report to the ECOFIN Council on 5 June 2000. The Commission is presently considering the arrangements for following up the report’s recommendations in the area of direct and indirect taxes.</p>
<p>The specific problem of uncollected tax debts raised by the honourable Member can only be addressed successfully through administrative cooperation between tax administrations and more specifically through mutual assistance in collection of tax debts. The original Community arrangements for mutual assistance on recovery of claims were put in place because it was recognised that it was increasingly likely that the debtor, or recoverable assets belonging to the debtor, were within the jurisdiction of another Member State. The arrangements were originally developed to cover agricultural levies and customs duties as sources of Community revenue<a href="#defann_25_4" name="refann_25_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 4</span>, but were later extended to cover VAT and excise duties<a href="#defann_25_5" name="refann_25_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 5</span>.</p>
<p>On 26 June 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a Parliament and Council directive amending the existing directive <span class="sup">6</span>. The aim of this proposal is to improve the functioning of the directive and to widen its scope to cover direct taxes. On 12 February 1999 the European Parliament endorsed this proposal and suggested certain amendments. The Commission duly presented an amended proposal on 7 May 1999<a href="#defann_25_6" name="refann_25_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 7</span>. The proposal is currently being discussed at Council level. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the problem which the proposal aims to solve, the Commission would highly recommend its early adoption.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has stated its intention to close the Economats in Brussels and Luxembourg, substantially in recognition of the fact that responsibility for providing such facilities cannot now be regarded to be a suitable task for the Commission as an institution.</p>
<p>The Economats currently employ a total of 8 permanent officials (4 each in Brussels and Luxembourg) and 28 external staff (21 in Brussels and 7 in Luxembourg). In 1999 the annual turnover of the Economats was EUR 8.66 million (EUR 6.3 million in Brussels and EUR 2.36 million in Luxembourg).</p>
<p>It will be important to ensure an orderly phasing-out and closure of the activities. It is therefore envisaged that the Economat in Brussels and Luxembourg will finally close at the end of 2001.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the provision of shopping facilities to staff, in particular in areas where no adequate shopping facilities exist, can play a useful role in helping personnel to reconcile their working and private lives, the Commission will look at possible alternatives to the Economats.

Like the European Union Member States, it fully endorses the efforts undertaken by the UN General-Secretary and his personal envoy, James Baker, to look into ways of arriving rapidly at a lasting concerted settlement of the dispute. The Commission supports the direct negotiations between the parties, in the conviction that the current deadlock can be overcome only by means of open and frank dialogue on all the aspects of the conflict between the parties concerned.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission is willing to provide support for the implementation of the various phases of the Peace Plan, both the voter identification phase and the repatriation or land rehabilitation phases. It has informed Mr Baker of this. Moreover, the Commission continues to raise this issue within the framework of the political dialogue with the Mediterranean partners that are most directly concerned, to wit, Morocco and Algeria.</p>
<p>As for humanitarian aid, the Commission continues to provide, via partner non-governmental organisations (NGOs), substantial food aid and medical aid to the Saharawi refugees of the Tindouf region. So far, EUR 56 million have been provided.

<p>The Commission is very concerned by the severe drought in Tajikistan. As a consequence it has decided to allocate an additional EUR 3 million to humanitarian assistance via its Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and to provide additional support to the World Food Programme worth over EUR 9 million for nearly 14,000 tonnes of flour and 2,000 tonnes of vegetable oil. This follows an allocation of about 11 000 metric tonnes of cereals in 1999, amounting to about EUR 5 million.</p>
<p>Currently there may be around 200 000 people in the north of Afghanistan who could flee into Tajikistan if the security situation deteriorates further. Of the 200 000 it is estimated by organisations in the country that 60 000 would probably try to flee to the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) region of the country which is the poorest region in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Since 1993, the Community has provided EUR 108.89 million in humanitarian assistance and nearly EUR 50 million through Food Security programmes. Contracts worth EUR 4 million have recently been signed for a demobilisation programme principally in the Karategin Valley and for a further EUR 1 million for rehabilitation works in GBAO of schools, hospitals and roads.</p>
<p>In 2000, macro financial support is also available for Tajikistan in the form of a new loan of EUR 60 million and a first grant tranche of EUR 7 million, was paid after full settlement by the country of its arrears towards the Community.

<p>The oil crisis which is still unfolding is having multiple adverse effects both on the economies of EU Member States and on the standards of living of various sectors of the population: workers, farmers, professionals and transporters. In addition to the rise in the international price of crude oil in US dollars, the effects of the galloping increase in the exchange rate of the dollar and the undervaluation of the euro in the international markets are making the crisis more severe. In Greece, the situation is even worse because of the fact that in addition to the already high special consumption tax on fuel, VAT is also imposed, not only on the added value of petrol and oil but also on the special consumption tax. This double taxation represents an added burden of 8% on the final price for the consumer. Does the Commission not consider that it is unacceptable to impose a tax upon a tax? What measures does it intend to take with regard to this issue?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The rise in fuel prices observed from the beginning of 1999 is due to the evolution of crude oil world prices. However, taxes form a significant part of the consumer price of oil products and their level varies considerably from one Member State to another. There are two kinds of taxes: (1) an excise duty in the form of a specific duty amount expressed as a fixed amount in euros and national currency per 1000 litres of fuel; and (2) VAT which is a consumption tax, levied on the total sales price of goods and services to final consumers.</p>
<p>As far as the excise duties are concerned, a harmonised specific excise duty (which is applied to quantities rather than values) has been introduced by Council Directive 92/82/EEC<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>1, the level of which represent the minimum rate to be applied by each Member State. Although in practice Member States apply rates that far exceed these minimum rates, for oil products used as motor fuel Greece applies rates which are very close to these Community minimum rates. They are among the three lowest rates in the Community. For diesel used as a propellant, for instance, Greece applies a rate of 252.55 euros/1000 litres, which is very close to the Community minimum rate of 245 euros/1000 litres.</p>
<p>Taking into account the specific nature of the excise duties it is clear that they are not influenced by inflation, or by the fluctuation of world prices of crude oil and therefore, their relative weight to the final consumer price is reducing when these prices are increasing.</p>
<p>As far as VAT is concerned its basis includes, where appropriate, any other taxes, levies, duties and charges, which may also be levied on the goods in question. When the price of goods increases, for whatever reason, the logical consequence is that the amount of VAT will also increase, as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of the total sales price. These rules are fully in line with Community VAT legislation (notably Article 11 of the Sixth VAT Directive). This is valid for all products and the Commission does not envisage a change to them. Greece applies a VAT rate of 18% on oil products which is below the average rate applied by the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission does not share the idea of using the tax instrument in order to neutralise increases on consumer prices when the crude oil prices increase. This correspond in reality to a transfer of revenue from the oil consuming to the oil producing countries and would run counter to our environmental objectives, notably under the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p>The only conceivable adjustment mechanism relates to VAT. It could be possible to stabilise VAT revenue in the event of significant fluctuations in oil prices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Swedish media (via the Swedish Government representative to the Convention) have spread the idea that the Charter of fundamental rights would restrict freedom of movement through the right to strike. This might occur, for example, if a transport strike is considered to be 'more important' than the freedom of movement of persons or goods. The Charter contains a general article, Article 54, which deals with the problem of 'conflicting' rights. It is my understanding that, as the Charter refers to national law, the right to strike as currently formulated in the Charter does not affect freedom of movement in the Union.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share my interpretation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In line with the determination of the European Council, the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights unites in a single text the range of fundamental rights already in force at European Union level in order to give them greater prominence in the eyes of the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p>The freedom of movement of persons as enshrined in the EC Treaty is retained in Article 45 of the draft Charter, while Article 28 thereof outlines the right of workers, in accordance with Community and national law, to take collective action, including strike action, in cases of conflicts of interest with their employers.</p>
<p>In practice, situations where there is a conflict between these two fundamental rights cannot be ruled out. Observations of this kind may also be made with regard to several other fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Article 52(1) of the Charter, by establishing a system allowing potential restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights, makes it possible to resolve this conflict between the freedom of movement and the right to strike. This provision makes it clear that the exercise of a right may not override any other right or freedom which is also recognised in the Charter. In no case, then, is it possible to suggest that one right may be ‘more important’ than another. Quite the contrary: the authorities, in imposing restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental rights at issue here – restrictions which may be perfectly legal – are required to establish a balance between the rights at issue in order to ensure that both rights are respected, proportionately, in the specific conditions of each case.</p>
<p>The Commission would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the circumstances she refers to are covered by a Community regulation, insofar as the free movement of goods is concerned. Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 of 7 December 1998<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the Member States, while expressly making an exception for the right to protection of fundamental rights (including, in the terms of the regulation, “the right or freedom to strike”), seeks to overcome obstacles causing serious disruption to the proper functioning of the internal market and inflicting serious losses on the individuals affected. The Charter does not have the effect of amending this regulation, which clearly respects the various fundamental rights involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The process of the construction of a new museum for the Acropolis – jointly funded by the EU – has been dogged by continual obstruction and poor decision-making. After approximately twenty years, the fact that a new architectural competition, the fourth in total, is being held for a building in the same location, with vague construction specifications, is an indication that the Greek authorities are guiding this large-scale and essential project towards a dead end.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Central Archaeological Council describes the finds from the excavations which are still going on as important archaeological discoveries, and that scientific bodies say the construction site is unsuitable because it is cramped and difficult to gain access to, will the Commission say what measures it will take to ensure that the museum is constructed within a reasonable time-frame and that it is built in a location which will not cover up other important archaeological finds. Will the Commission also say whether it will be worthy of its exhibits and guarantee full protection for the objects and for visitors?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Regional Development Fund has cofinanced a study for the design and construction of the new Acropolis museum under the Community Support Framework (CSF) for the 1994-1999 programming period.</p>
<p>Under the decentralised arrangements for the management of programmes financed by the Structural Funds, responsibility for this project is entirely with the Greek authorities. The Commission expects the Greek authorities to include it in the Operational Programme ‘Culture’ of the new CSF for the period 2000­2006, in order to complete the necessary technical studies and to allow construction to begin in the near future.</p>
<p>According to information obtained by the Commission, an early start may indeed be possible. The organisation for the construction of the new Acropolis museum (OANMA) appointed a new President and Board of Directors in May 2000. In July 2000, the invitation to tender for the new Acropolis museum was published. Over the past few days, the first stage of the process for the selection of the architectural, structural and electromechanical designs has been undertaken. In early spring 2001, the preliminary designs and models will be completed and an international jury will decide on the best design.</p>
<p>During 2001, OANMA anticipates the completion of the final plans, and towards the end of that year it hopes to commence building works. In the meantime, it will complete the purchase of local properties and a committee of archaeologists, in collaboration with OANMA has commenced the necessary conservation of the exhibits and is preparing the final plans for the total exhibit programme.</p>
<p>The Central Archaeological Council has determined the zones where construction of the new museum can proceed and the areas within the ancient ruins where foundations can be laid. The archaeological finds which have come to light through the excavations on the site will be incorporated into the new Acropolis museum and specific provisions for their appropriate exhibition will be made. The new museum will be linked with the archaeological site of the Acropolis and it will also provide a panoramic view of the hill and the monuments of the Acropolis.</p>
<p>A special commission of archaeologists and architects of the Ministry of Culture has discussed the building programme of the new museum in a series of meetings and is now shaping the final draft of the building programme of the new Acropolis museum.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there now seems to be grounds for optimism that the Greek authorities will proceed quickly to ensure that the project is carried out.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
