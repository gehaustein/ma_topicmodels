It is the first directive to be adopted under what is known as the Lamfalussy procedure. This is a piece of framework legislation that will be supplemented by implementing regulations. The Commission will pass this secondary legislation on the basis of proposals by the Committee of European Securities Regulators, known as CESR in English. The CESR will draft its proposals on the basis of broad public consultation. The Commission will also adopt the implementing regulations in a transparent way. The Ecofin Council and the European Parliament will monitor the Commission. Parliament will have a deadline of three months in which to deliver an opinion. If, within that period, Parliament adopts a resolution, the Commission will have to re-examine its draft measures. This, therefore, provides a guarantee that secondary legislation will be democratically monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, in order to provide the possibility both of giving secondary legislation more regulations of a technical nature and of providing colegislators with final decision-making rights, a ‘call-back’ procedure, amending Article 202 of the Treaty, absolutely must be provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the directive is to lay down the same rules for all financial products throughout the Union, in order to combat all forms of insider dealing and market abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament adopted 77 amendments. The Council accepted 60 of these in full and 10 in part. This is clearly a success for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to pay tribute to the Belgian, Spanish and Danish presidencies and to the Commission staff, who have always proved willing to reach workable compromises. I also address my thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, especially Mr Thomas Mann. Because the Commission and the Council have declared their agreement on the five amendments accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs following second reading, the directive could be implemented quite rapidly. The new rules will certainly help to restore confidence in the integrity of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the bursting of the speculative bubble over the stock markets and the financial scandals that have hit both the United States and Europe, many investors are hesitant. Since the beginning of 2000, more than USD 7 trillion of virtual stock exchange profits have also been wiped off the market. In Europe, several thousand billion euros have also gone up in smoke. This situation destabilises economies, penalises savers, weakens investment funds and lowers the value of pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to restore the confidence of investors and small savers in the financial markets, we must combat all forms of criminal connivance, forcing companies to be as transparent as possible. In recent months, we have seen numerous revelations about the pally form of capitalism operating amongst company directors, accounting companies, investment banks and financial analysts. This entire group, which on the surface, appears to be quite respectable, operated in such a way that it could milk stock market exuberance for their own profit.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the market’s lack of transparency, there have been conflicts of interest within accounting firms. Many financial analysts have been both judge and accused. Auditors and analysts duped the market players that placed their trust in them. The reason for this was the practice of stock options and other personal bonuses to be received in line with the financial results of their employers.</p>
<p class="contents">The sums in question sometimes defy belief. One example is that the CEOs of the twenty-five largest American companies to have declared themselves bankrupt in the last 18 months had awarded themselves, in the three years preceding their company’s bankruptcy, packages totalling around USD 3.3 billion. Although we should not generalise, the golden years of the financial sector have nevertheless led to a sort of ‘financial mad cow disease<span class="italic">’</span> – the ‘mad finance syndrome’. Just like the clean-up of the meat market, the need for and the establishment of a rigorous monitoring system and the clean-up of the financial markets will require precise rules to combat all insider dealing and all market manipulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole aim of the directive is to better regulate the financial markets. It is not seeking to regulate the profession of journalism. Unfortunately, some parts of the press, especially in the United Kingdom, have launched a sometimes incredible campaign against the Commission’s proposals, suggesting that the very freedom of the press was at stake. The freedom of the press has not been in any danger and nor will it be. The first article clearly states that no journalist can be held responsible for disseminating false or misleading information, unless that journalist is gaining any advantage or profit from divulging such information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am starting from the premise that all journalists attempt to do their job correctly and that they check their sources. If a journalist is wrong, they will not be held responsible, unless he has touched money in the manipulation that has occurred. Some recent scandals, from the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> to the <span class="italic">Magazine des actionnaires</span>, show that no profession is entirely honest. Parliament wishes to encourage the establishment of codes of good conduct and self-regulation for journalists, not least with regard to potential conflicts of interest, but the best form of self-regulation in the world will never exempt legislators from having to remain vigilant and from intervening at regulatory level if, perchance, self-regulation should prove to be inadequate or unworkable. This is why I ask you to reject the two strangely identical amendments tabled on this matter. It is simply unacceptable that a profession, even one as respectable as journalism, should attempt to exempt itself definitively from a European regulation that concerns it. Once again, it is not the CESR that will establish the rules but the Commission, under the democratic control of the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you, Mr President, that I shall be the first, and not the only one, to oppose any attack on the freedom of the press or against any unworkable over-regulation. European law must, however, be the same for everyone. Every democrat and, consequently, every journalist worthy of the name should welcome this crucial principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, for all his efforts. As we all know, he has been working under heavy pressure. This is a very complex and sensitive issue. I applaud the fact that he has resolutely defended the aim of the directive, which is to enhance the integrity of European financial markets. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and Members of this Parliament and, in particular, of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">After all the discussions we have had on comitology in the past, let me highlight the successful cooperation between our institutions in drawing up this directive, the first to apply the Lamfalussy approach in full. I believe that today’s text will provide a good basis for effective cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the future. As Mr Goebbels knows, the Commission is in favour of amending Articles 202 and 211 of the Treaty to bring the positions of Parliament and the Council into line. I hope that will become even clearer in the contribution the Commission is preparing for the Convention, which, I hope, will be finalised by the end of November. Mr Goebbels, his colleagues and the Commission think alike on that topic.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure this Parliament that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats – certainly not with the equivalent of financial mad cows, as Mr Goebbels called them. That is a very vivid phrase which the Commission finds very apt. We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for every consumer and investor.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will indeed enhance investor protection and make European financial markets more secure and attractive in future. It will dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, recent events have shown how important these issues are. Scandals like Enron and other household names show clearly the need for strong rules to make markets more transparent and safe, to ensure that they remain free of abuse and free of fraud. The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are essential to sustained economic growth and the creation of wealth. Abuse of markets leads to companies paying more for the finance they need; investors will stay away and the economy will suffer as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do everything to stamp this out and to restore public confidence in our markets. The directive aims to do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">Since there has been an in-depth discussion about the application of the directive to journalists, which Mr Goebbels referred to, let me say a few words on that subject. Firstly, may I make it clear that under no circumstances do we want to add to the burdens of journalists. The directive does not do that. Journalism is a difficult profession; the pressure of work is great and we do not want to add to that. The directive guarantees freedom of expression and the liberty of the media. That is clearly expressed in the recitals, and the text of the directive itself introduces several safeguards for journalists, including the possibility of self-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, recent scandals in several Member States have shown how recommendations by journalists to buy or sell a specific share can influence its market price to their advantage. What we do not want is to exempt from transparency obligations the small category of highly specialised financial journalists who recommend investment strategies. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments 6 and 7. It would not seem justified to exempt this rather small category of persons from basic market integrity standards which apply to all the other market participants.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, completely or partially excluding journalists from the scope of the directive would mean harmonising the definition of ‘journalist’ at Community level, not a very easy task and something we do not wish to do. Therefore, Amendment 5 is a compromise proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for today’s plenary. It is fair both to journalists and to the public interest, and therefore acceptable. I strongly hope that Members of this Parliament share the view of Mr Goebbels and of the Commission on this point. After all, financial journalists who specifically recommend a certain strategy to the investing public should declare any conflict of interests they may have. I do not see why that should not be a useful aspect of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission can agree with Amendments 1 to 5, but we cannot agree, for the reasons which I have already explained, to Amendments 6 and 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Should Parliament adopt the common position together with Amendments 1 to 5 and reject Amendments 6 and 7, for which I am now making a plea, I hope the Council will be able finally to accept this text in the next few weeks. Adoption of the directive before the end of the year would be a major step towards the integration of European financial markets by 2005 that we all aspire to.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend adoption of this directive to Parliament and I hope that all who take part in the debate will agree with Mr Goebbels and myself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The American and European financial markets continue to be hit by successive scandals, which make it clear that the actors in them include many black sheep, who lack professional integrity. Balance sheets are being falsified, funds embezzled, and false information deftly fed to the public. Securities are first talked up in price, then offloaded at a profit, and shortly afterwards the price falls rapidly. Many small investors have suffered as a result of market abuse and insider dealing. This makes clear rules and confidence-building measures necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I had a hand in a number of the amendments. At first reading, Parliament submitted 77 amendments, to the quality of which the Council paid tribute by adopting almost 60 in their entirety and giving partial approval to 10 more. At the time, I congratulated Robert Goebbels, the rapporteur, and I would like to reiterate those congratulations now that we are at second reading stage. We have come to agree on important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The points at issue include ‘frontrunning’, in which, on the basis of a client's being of sufficient size to affect the market on its own, brokers trade on their own account even before they carry out the client's orders. This is to exploit insider information and is already prohibited. A ban should apply to all the markets within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of how financial journalists who recommend investments to the public should be obliged to disclose their conflicts of interest – to which Commissioner Bolkestein has just referred – provided substantial material for debate. We are not dealing here with objective financial information, but exclusively with recommendations to the public. There are journalists who succeed in using their own publications to manipulate the prices of securities for their own benefit. Yet it should be in the interests of journalists themselves to make a distinction between their reputable and less reputable colleagues. It is surely not acceptable that a small element in a single profession should get some sort of derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have proposed, by way of compromise, taking Mrs Kauppi's amendment as a basis for taking into account journalists' professional rules of conduct, including self-regulation, when arranging the technical details. Mr Goebbels and I have jointly tabled an amendment providing for this idea to be incorporated in Article 6 (10), which covers this area. This was supported by a broad majority on the committee. I am of course acquainted with the criticisms of CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and with the open letter from journalists' associations concerning its work, but I want now to point out that it has no legislative authority, and cannot, therefore, impose binding rules on the way journalists work. The Commission called on it, as an independent institution, to play an advisory role. The Commission will then elaborate the regulation, which will be submitted to the European Securities Committee – including representatives of the Member States' finance ministries – and also to us in Parliament. I cannot imagine that the Commission will disregard the principles of press freedom and journalists' right to free expression of opinion. After all, they are anchored in the recitals of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur, then, I am seeking support for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee's resolutions dating back to early October, which, slightly altered, now form Amendments Nos 1 to 5. Commissioner, on that you have my forthright support. Under these circumstances, there is a good chance that the Commission and the Council will give their assent at an early stage. The directive could enter into force at the beginning of 2003. That would represent a decisive move towards greater integrity in Europe's financial markets, with greater confidence on the part of investors resulting in increased investments. I believe we have a good chance of ensuring that we win broad support for this important piece of comitology.</p>

It is timely because confidence in the integrity of market participants has been seriously damaged over the last two years as a result of various cases of market abuse, chiefly in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is appropriate because the common position addresses the need for regulatory authorities to have sufficient enforcement flexibility to be able to detect market abuse and sanction its practitioners on a consistent and effective basis. Also covered is the right of market participants to enjoy reasonable legal certainty that their actions will be considered appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is to be able to deal with market abuse in a consistent manner. Those who have intent and knowledge of market abuse – and knowledge includes journalists – or who act recklessly will be punished. Those whose actions are innocent but have unintended effects will not, however, be penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we now have a debate with so few amendments tabled nearly 18 months after the initial proposal, when the financial services industry initially questioned whether there was any need for such a proposal, owes much to the skill and patience of our rapporteur, Mr Goebbels. I would like to congratulate him.</p>
<p class="contents">We have obtained an appropriate definition of market manipulation and of financial instruments whose use falls within the scope of the directive.

It should clearly cover financial journalists, and Article 1 of the directive does just that. If journalists profit from the dissemination of information, they will fall within the scope of the directive and they can and will be prosecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">The controversial question is different. Should journalists be subject to new regulations that may be established by the Commission and financial regulators, as currently proposed under Article 6(10)? Currently, Member States must ensure there is appropriate regulation so that persons who disseminate research or other information, i.e. news organisations, take reasonable care that such information is fairly presented. Commissioner Bolkestein would have us believe that it only concerns journalists if they recommend shares. That is not what the directive says. It actually gives the Commission and financial regulators a role in determining whether information is fairly presented.</p>
<p class="contents">You do not need much imagination to see how this provision could undermine press freedom. It is extraordinary to suggest that the financial regulators, the most criticised public institutions in most Member States – they always get the blame when banks fail – should help determine whether information has been fairly presented. This is why the ELDR Group has retabled an amendment we tabled in committee seeking to exclude <span class="italic">bona fide</span> journalists from this regulatory provision, not from the whole scope of the directive, and to do so without opening up any loophole that would allow financial analysts to parade themselves as journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we really want today to set such an extraordinary precedent? Do we really want to introduce the first ever European regulation of the press? Do we want to ignore the objections of news organisations like <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span>, <span class="italic">Reuters</span>, <span class="italic">Agence France Press</span> and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, all of which live by their high reputations? Do we really want to take this terrible first step of regulating the press without a proper discussion of the potential consequences?</p>

<p class="contents">We should, in particular, welcome the fact that the pressure to incorporate the concept of intent into the definition of offences, a concept which is usually impossible to prove, has been rejected, and also the fact that we have strengthened obligations of transparency in the field of insider information and in cooperation between market surveillance authorities. We are therefore in the process of breaking in the Lamfalussy procedure which has got off to a good start, I believe, with fine cooperation between our three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I feel that it is perhaps regrettable that the Commission asked, at 6 p.m., to begin its work on the regulation’s implementation before it is even adopted by Parliament and the Council. In any event, this was merely an excuse to redouble the pressure exerted by the lobbies of financial journalists who want, in fact, to create a general exception in their favour in the field of comitology; I am talking about self-regulation full stop. In our view, financial journalists must indeed comply with all the provisions concerning transparency and the veracity of information and, with regard to the progress that can be made in the field of comitology, this will fall under a future revision of Article 202.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we fully reject the two amendments tabled by the Liberal and PPE-DE groups and support Amendment No 5, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which further strengthens the guarantees concerning that profession.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to say that, in light of the extremely serious shortcomings revealed by current developments, we are simply trying to take the first step, particularly where insider dealing is concerned.

Our whole economic system is based on trust. And as long as trust is not betrayed, the economic system functions as we expect it to. Expectations of the financial markets are closely linked to the way in which legislative institutions, such as the Council, the Commission and Parliament, deal with unexpected circumstances. The financial markets expect to have regulations, but these should be unambiguous regulations, which are not open to many different interpretations.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of interpretation, in particular, plays an important role in the debate about prior knowledge. After all, what is prior knowledge and when do we talk about prior knowledge which has an actual effect? Article 1 of the directive mentions having ‘a considerable influence on the prices of financial instruments’ – a concept which ought to be explained, however, on the basis of the effect of the directive in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to draw up one unambiguous rule which would apply to all situations. Events which have taken place in practice within Member States have led to regulations being drawn up in order to prevent or sanction fraud and insider dealing. This practice shows that in many cases an assessment of the facts is required based on a given situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, journalists are very much in a position to determine from specific cases in practice whether prior knowledge applies. After all, in their day-to-day work they have to judge whether something is ‘news’ or prior knowledge. The reason for which information is gathered or disseminated forms the basis for the assessment of whether prior knowledge applies or not. It is for these reasons that I will not support Amendments Nos 6 and 7.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unsatisfactory to declare that technical modality does not apply to journalists in the exercise of their profession. Considering that an assessment takes place on the basis of facts and situations, reference should be made to existing rules and self-regulation within this professional group. It is also the case that an appeal to this professional group constitutes a question of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I believe that a number of matters should be regulated at Member State level, the arguments for harmonising the rules at European level are convincing. National legislation falls short within the international context of the financial markets. I support, therefore, the recommendation for a second reading by Mr Goebbels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do feel, however, that there are a number of things we need to bear in mind. We are all quite familiar with the Enron question and other financial scandals, but the important thing is not to be under the illusion that a new law, a new regulation, a new authority will resolve the problem of market abuse and insider dealing. It may be that the situation is gradually improving, but we must be under no illusion – I reiterate – as to whether the new law, the new directive, the new authority will resolve once and for all the issue of transparency and the need to prevent abuse in the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have a number of particularly serious concerns where the regulation affects the mechanisms through which information reaches the market – principally the work of the media. Here too, in the past, the most effective tool for preventing the exploitation and manipulation of confidential and other information has proved to be the market, which confirms the reliability and validity of methods of producing and disseminating information.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Huhne said and with the amendment tabled by Mr Huhne and Mrs Villiers, and I believe that we must avoid introducing specific, rigid legislation, which would, inevitably, ultimately lead to some sort of regulation of the freedom of the press and the freedom to exercise the profession of journalism. We must therefore reject the illusion that we can use the law to regulate and guarantee the veracity of the information provided by economics and financial journalists. Moreover, we would be running the risk of it having little or no effect because, if a person wants to put the information in their possession to an inappropriate use, they will find a way to do so whatever we do, whatever the law governing the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, it is vital to have tough rules to prevent insider dealing and to punish those who abuse the market, including journalists and market practitioners. It is vital to protect consumer investors from the misconduct of market insiders. I would like to put on record my thanks to the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for taking on board a number of issues in relation to accepted market practices, commodity derivatives and Chinese walls at first reading. But this draft directive leaves a number of very significant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of very serious concern, as we have heard, to a whole range of journalists and media organisations across the European Union – media organisations that live or die by their reputation for integrity and a high standard of public conduct. I agree that journalists should be subject to market abuse rules. I agree that journalists should be subject to rules that prevent conflicts of interest. I agree that we should have tough enforcement mechanisms to enforce those rules. However, I do not agree with the rapporteur that the Committee of European Securities Regulators is the appropriate body to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of journalists, the rules should be enforced by specialist media regulators, who know how the media works and understand the issues that relate to journalists. CESR does not have the expertise to regulate journalists. It has already demonstrated that it does not understand how the media works. The proposals in its consultation paper would have been impractical and unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Special constitutional issues apply to journalists because of the demands and importance of that vital constitutional issue, freedom of speech. It is vital that we respect those constitutional issues. It is at least arguable that, in some countries, giving CESR this role would be unconstitutional and contrary to the principle of freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The free flow of information to the markets is absolutely vital in preventing market abuse and protecting consumer investors. If we disrupt that free flow of information to the market, we will be playing into the hands of market abusers. That would be the consequence of allowing CESR to regulate journalists when it does not understand the media issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the first reading, MEPs believed that Article 6(5) was not targeted at journalists. Despite this understanding, CESR has indicated it will regulate journalists. This is a test case. This is the first time we have used the Lamfalussy process. We need to use our codecision power to send a clear message to CESR that we will stand up for the prerogatives and powers of the only elected EU institution and support Amendment 7. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft directive on market abuse that we are discussing today is one step in the right direction. Investor confidence is crucial for the successful development of our financial services markets. The integrity of European markets has to be safeguarded. Common and efficient standards to combat market abuse have to be established and thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, actions that intentionally manipulate financial markets, including those by financial journalists, have to be penalised. Like some other colleagues, however, I am worried about some proposals whose basic intention might be good and respectable but whose effects would be devastating. I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists. But these need to be rules that are sensitive to the media context. Free speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy. In many countries, for example in my country and in Scandinavia, it would be simply unconstitutional to subject journalists to the sort of heavy-handed regulation that the CESR put forward in July.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the draft guidelines, a report by a journalist that merely records accurately a recommendation made by an investment analyst – for example, Merrill Lynch has upgraded its rating on Nokia – would require a public disclosure of personal interest on the part of the journalist. This would be impractical, unnecessary and disproportionate. The European Parliament did not address the issues raised by Article 6(5) at first reading because it was widely believed that the Article was targeted at financial analysts employed by investment firms where well-publicised abuses have occurred. The publication by the CESR of its draft guidelines in July revealed that it has another plan. The aim is to cover an extensive range of routine financial journalism where standards have remained high and existing governance mechanisms have proved adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">As explained above, the recent amendment to Article 6(10) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient, as the CESR would still be able to override or amend these mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedback we have had from the European financial journalism community is clear. The proposals would have an adverse impact on media freedom and on journalistic independence. Financial journalism contributes to one of the key objectives of the directive, that is to ensure market transparency. This is especially important for small retail investors. They are the investors in the European Parliament should be trying to protect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important and necessary directive, it is one that we want; we want an agreement with the Council, and we want the directive to enter into force at the beginning of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is the first under the new comitology procedure. I see it as being founded on seven points. The first is that the insider-trading directive, which has provided the framework, is thirteen years old. A lot has happened in the meantime. It is based on the results of the Lisbon Council and on the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit. It forms part of the action plan on financial services. It is a response to 11 September, because the directive is what the Member States want in order to be better able to take counter-terrorist action. It is a response to Enron, Microsoft, and the EM.TV trial; today's information society makes it easier to engage in insider trading by exploiting the many sources of information available.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to build up confidence in the financial services sector, in the financial markets and in the economy. This directive helps to do that by safeguarding the integrity of the European financial markets, establishing rules for combating market abuse in Europe, and strengthening investors' confidence in the European financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, though, that we have not made it easier for ourselves, as this debate itself shows. Between the Goebbels Report as it was at first reading, and what we have before us today, there are two more extreme standpoints. Let me point out, though, that this is not a directive on journalists, but one on insider dealing and market manipulation. This directive is not to exclude anyone, but it does have to deal with the differences in quality. We should not expect this House to come to a decision that promotes censorship and infringes fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is the basis of our political work. Because we want to get both sides together, combining the arguments of Mr Huhne, Mrs Villiers, Mrs Kauppi and those of the parties affected, the committee came up with a compromise motion, and I believe that it, and perceptiveness, have enabled us to find a very good and broad compromise on the basis of the special role of journalists and of the possibility of self-regulation.</p>

It is my belief that the answer to this question should be an unambiguous ‘yes’, even though many of the actors take the opposite view.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, in principle, opposed to the proliferation of rules. I hope that the future will see politicians, policies, and even the Commission, judged on the basis of what rules and directives they have abolished or unified, rather than the opposite. This situation, though, is rather different. This is about honesty, about trust; this has to do with the prevention of theft, insecurity and, in the final analysis, fraud. I am glad that there is to be an increase in controls and, it is to be hoped, that there will be more sanctions in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the subject of journalists and media freedom, I cannot but agree with what Mr Karas has said about the principle that we stand up for freedom of opinion and oppose any sort of censorship. I do, however, see it as inadequate to take the view, as some in this House do, that the good name of certain media and media organisations that have been referred to guarantees that abuses will be prevented. I was myself in that line of business and am, alas, all too well aware that publishers and journalists are human, but that there is a very, very narrow dividing line between honesty and respectability on the one hand and debatable conduct on the other. It is for this reason that I believe a good reputation does not at present offer a sufficient guarantee, and that there is a need for regulation. Arthur Andersen also had a good reputation until that business was struck by disaster.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of these interests being disclosed. I believe that we owe a duty to the public to address problems and find approaches towards a solution even in sensitive areas. It will be for the future to show whether we have been able to do that properly in the first stage, with all the nuances involved. We will then have to make any adjustments that turn out to be necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">Both Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi said that freedom of speech is under attack. With all due respect to those Members of Parliament who have spoken and whom I have just mentioned, that is a caricature of the aims of this directive. Financial journalists are free to write whatever they wish. There is not the slightest doubt that they can write as they please. The only thing the directive says is that, when they recommend to the public certain stocks in which they themselves have invested, they must state that fact. In other words, if financial journalists advise the public to buy shares in a certain company and if they themselves own shares in that company, they must declare how many shares they own.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand why that should be an attack on the freedom of the press or, as Mr Huhne said, regulation of the press or of the media by the back door. Why should the rule of transparency apply to all and sundry who engage in dealings on the stock market but not to financial journalists? After all, we are simply asking them to be transparent about their investment in stocks they are recommending the public buy.</p>

<p class="contents">Since 1996, when the first guidelines were adopted, certain salient events have taken place on the European energy scene. I shall limit myself to pointing out the most important, namely the first phase of the internal market, increasing use of natural gas – which also reflects our concern for improved environmental protection – the setting of more ambitious objectives with regard to the use of renewable energy sources and, lastly, the prospects that have now been confirmed with regard to the enlargement of the Union. The Commission proposal reflects these events in the priorities of our energy network policy and in the other provisions of the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important element of our proposal is the establishment of twelve priority axes for the development of the energy networks, in order to integrate them fully at European level. These axes determine the broad lines that are essential to the operation of a competitive energy market and improved safety of the energy supply, specifically with regard to natural gas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the Barcelona European Council gave its approval to the swift implementation of these projects and clearly recognised their political importance for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that, in addition to the proposals for a revision of the guidelines for transport and energy networks, the Commission has also proposed to adapt certain provisions of the Rules of Procedure with regard to financial aid for these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission has suggested the possibility of granting more financial aid, specifically up to 20% of the priority energy network projects. It is clear that increased aid will only be granted to projects that really need it and in which there is a clear prospect of accelerated development, effective implementation and added value for the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the energy networks, this concentration of financial means is taking place with a limited, low, constant budget and therefore there should in theory be no concerns with regard to the impact on competition or on spending, because, I repeat, the volume and quantity remain the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to all the consequences of enlargement, I would like to ask you to be patient. A large number of projects of interest to the candidate countries already appear in this proposal. The Commission considers, however, that these countries need to undergo an initial period of increased competition in the energy market before implementing the priority axes. As far as possible, the Commission will present a proposal in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have briefly summed up the Commission’s objectives in presenting this proposal and I eagerly await the debate on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of congestion and insufficient joint activity, certain Member States can now only profit to a limited extent from the advantages of the open markets, meaning that competitive advantages for consumers are becoming increasingly smaller. The European Commission is therefore right to propose a reform of the guidelines for Trans-European Networks in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The revised proposal takes account of the liberalisation of the energy markets, the increasing external dependence on energy and the stricter requirements to get sustainable sources of energy accepted. These are the objectives which have been emphasised by the political leaders on the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona. Concentration on a new list of priority projects forms the core of this proposal. Member States will give special support and attention to these projects. The maximum percentage for co-financing will be increased from 10% to 20% and from now on the construction phase will take precedence.</p>
<p class="contents">The question which immediately comes to mind is whether this is the best solution. In my opinion, a massive subsidy for the energy sector is not a good solution because I feel that it is at variance with the current trend towards liberalisation and the creation of a competitive internal market. It must be emphasised that the main responsibility lies with the energy sector and with the industry itself. Measures which are taken on the basis of this decision may in no way be allowed to cause disruption of competitive practices within the internal energy market. I also feel that Community aid should only relate to the design phase. Subsidies for the construction phase such as proposed by the Commission should then only be granted in exceptional cases. In this context, the integration of renewable energy sources constitutes an important factor. In my opinion, these will contribute in future to the diversification of energy sources and thus as such to the continuity of energy provision within the European Union. Support of tangible projects such as off-shore wind parks should therefore be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which the Commission wants to implement all this does give rise to a number of questions. I think it is not a good idea to give the European Parliament a <span class="italic">droit de regard</span> only when the issues concern strategically important changes to project specifications. It is important to seek a balance between, on the one hand, a quick reaction by the Commission to new developments and, on the other hand, the need for effective control by Parliament. To satisfy the need for transparency, the Commission needs to submit regular reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to emphasise that actual measures will be necessary if we want to reap the rewards of the internal market. In fact, the new guidelines might significantly contribute towards coping with the problems of: the continuity of energy provision, the integration of renewable energy, the outermost regions as well as enlargement. I would like to clearly point out that Community aid must be applied pragmatically and that, in the first instance, accountability must be given to the energy sector itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He took the views of the shadow rapporteurs into consideration back in the formulation stage in an exemplary manner and the levels of cooperation we have seen have been fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of the fact that in rather more than a year’s time there will be 10 new Member States in the European Union. Their concerns are also our concerns. The candidate countries must be included in programmes like the TEN-Energy programme as swiftly as possible. All candidate countries have huge problems with regard to their electricity transmission networks. In the Baltic countries there are no such networks as such. If and when Ignalina is closed, and whatever decisions are made concerning bituminous shale, the Baltic countries’ energy strategies cannot rely exclusively on Russia. What sort of timetable does the Commission have for including the new Member States in the trans-European networks?</p>
<p class="contents">I have given emphasis to the question of whether the EU should support the private sector. The basic philosophy here is that the energy sector must be one in which the market economy works unaided. Only in exceptional cases can public sector aid be granted to the private sector. The Commission’s contribution, which in the end is the European taxpayer’s money, must not be raised from 10% to 20%. Previously, aid was available only for studies in the planning stage. If the Commission’s new proposal is accepted, aid would also be granted for project development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is always the risk that project coordinators will increase their costs just to obtain as much aid from the Commission as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission will provide support for building trans-European networks. This programme and this amount of money, however, will have only a limited effect, and will not solve the problems of Europe’s energy infrastructure. The solution to the problem of bottlenecks is to be found in the Member States rather than in this EU programme. There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level. Residents complain about electromagnetic radiation, the impact on the environment, blighted landscapes, and so on. It is for this reason that no solution has been found for the largest bottleneck in the European electricity networks, which is on the border between Spain and France.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters relating to technology must not be linked to this programme. We are now deciding on trans-European networks, without adopting a position on what technology is to be used in producing the energy transmitted through the network and what its source is. The supplementary role renewable energy sources play in basic production is a part of the European energy palette. In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions. This report is about infrastructure, not energy production. The network and production must be kept separate.</p>
<p class="contents">As a separate issue I want to mention Amendment No 9. If this is meant to suggest that renewable energy sources will result in lower charges for the consumer, that is not true. All the research shows that nuclear power is the cheapest option for the consumer of all forms of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing an electricity interconnection capacity of at least 10% as a European minimum level. The level of interconnection is already 20% in some countries, however. The Commission should set its targets higher and insist on a level of 20% for all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rapkay (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by making a point of thanking Mr Beysen. It is unlike me to start a speech by congratulating the rapporteur, because I think that is what we are here for and we generally make a good job of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that Mr Beysen deserves special praise for his hard work in contacting the other groups right from the start, in order to ensure the report was as unanimous as possible before it was tabled in plenary. And he has succeeded admirably. So thank you for involving us from the outset. As a result, my group feels there is no need to table any amendments because, in my opinion, what Mr Beysen has done is fine as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to just comment briefly on three political points that are important to me. First, as the Commissioner made clear, this decision comes under the general heading of the liberalisation of the energy market; in other words, it contributes to what is already on the Council's agenda. And when it comes to the overall package to open up the energy market, let there be no mistake, we have handed our homework in on time. We adopted our first reading here in plenary on 13 March, after the Council urged us to get a move on. The Commission did likewise; it too has done its homework, unlike the Council. The Council is doing what it always does, what it does best – nothing at all. It sits and talks and fails to come to any decision. That amounts to institutionalised indecisiveness, and that is why we need to say at this juncture: this is an overall package and we want results so that we can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I really do think the Commission was right in this context to suggest – and our resolution should reflect this – that strategically important projects in the trans-European energy network sector should be given top priority. By which we mean projects which are vital for security of supply, strategically important projects which are important in opening up the market, especially those relating to one part of this package I referred to, namely the regulation on which Mr Mombaur acted as rapporteur. It is a pity he is not here today; I think he too would have had a few comments to make here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, unlike traffic networks, the industry and companies involved in the energy networks generally make real money. They make money! And that means that it is primarily up to the industry to finance these projects. It is our job as legislator to support this by putting framework conditions in place, which brings me back to the fact that the Council needs to wrap things up. So that is how we want to go about this, by cofinancing support but with the companies in the front row when it comes to putting money in the kitty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has raised some important points, and our group supports his approach. The Commission is proposing that financial support for the trans-European networks must be stepped up. This is to be supported in order to foster the internal market in electricity and gas. As has been said here, it is also important to connect the new Member States to the internal market in energy. This point of view is also contained in the report adopted by Parliament on cross-border exchanges in electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also already been said here that the main responsibility for constructing and maintaining adequate energy networks lies with EU industry and business. In this sense the energy networks differ from the trans-European networks, which receive large amounts of public money. Network operators, however, have no interest in removing bottlenecks in the supply to their neighbours. For that reason, state intervention and EU aid to promote competition is well justified. Naturally we also have to see that aid does not distort competition and that it is used for the right purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Concentrating EU aid on priority projects will encourage the removal of bottlenecks and boost competition, giving consumers greater choice. In this way Europe’s own energy resources will be put to more effective use and the European economy will be given a boost.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing the trans-European energy networks, account must also be taken of social and economic rapprochement. We also have to ensure networks are developed in island, peripheral and remote regions. If necessary we must provide support for connecting the networks in these regions to other networks. Following on from Union decisions, we also have to encourage the diversification of forms of energy and increase the use of renewable energy sources. We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent massive storm damage was a reminder that we must insist on companies and industry being sufficiently prepared to repair damage speedily and restore networks in all regions of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Security of supply is a prerequisite for the political independence of our countries and of Europe. This security requires a diversification of energy sources and will involve major long term, not to say extremely long-term investment. Energy is, furthermore, an important factor in land-use planning and falls entirely within the field of public services in the truest sense of the word. I would add that we must always bear in mind that when we talk about energy and about transport networks that, whereas new infrastructures must be created, existing infrastructures must also be reorganised in order to make better use of them. Lastly, there must be – and I wish to express this forcefully – an obsession with the environment in all its dimensions: the visual dimension, pollution, and the despoliation of resources, not forgetting the issue of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, with regard to the report by Mr Beysen, whom I congratulate on his work, I can state my broad agreement with the proposals that have been made. We must in fact improve and extend the energy transport networks and, by means of studies and investment, support the implementation of the least profitable ones where they are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market in energy is necessary but what it needs more than deregulation is investment throughout the Union, especially in the least accessible and least densely populated regions. No one would deny that the interlinking of networks is necessary. Let us not forget, however, that we need energy to put into these networks and a number of conditions must be met if we are to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to confirm the importance to us of renewable energies, of research in this field and of the public investment needed for its development. I must also admit that I do not fully understand the connection that some people wish to make between this aim of developing renewable energies and a liberal approach that often leads to a quest for the lowest cost in the short term, without worrying about the consequences in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, whilst remaining critical of the liberal principles that I believe are dangerous for Europe’s energy independence and for small consumers, not forgetting the least-favoured regions, I believe that the Commission guidelines on the Trans-European Networks are a step in the right direction and, as they stand, I thank you for them, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no academic evidence for this. What do we have to do if we want to reduce oligopolistic tendencies in the European market? Firstly, we must reduce market dominance. We need to bring in measures such as divestiture in those countries where there are dominant operators. Secondly, we must increase centralised electricity production, because that is the only way to make the sector more competitive in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Independent research shows that there is no economic rationale for spending billions on a new electricity grid. I have with me some summaries of these studies and I will hand them over to the Commissioner. So what should we do with the public funds available to us? We should spend them on gas pipelines, because that will bring more competition and security of supply. We should spend money on offshore projects in the North Sea and the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically, this market and the grid which exists in Europe were set up to promote centralised fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. If we want fair competition, we have to use some public money to provide a level playing field for offshore projects. We have enormous potential for this.</p>
<p class="contents">This should not be a Christmas gift shop. If you look at the annexes to the report, this is a Christmas gift shop with all the electricity lines any operator ever wanted to build in Europe. This is not a good use of European public funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It raises a number of issues which relate to the region I represent, Sardinia, but which also concern all the islands in the Community and, therefore, around 15 million citizens dispersed throughout all the seas of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The general framework governing the trans-European networks described in this proposal includes, of course, the desire and the intention to help the underdeveloped regions. The amendment I have tabled equates the situation of the islands to that of the less-developed regions, for energy is one of the sectors in which islands are at a greater disadvantage: there is not one island on our continent that does not have an energy problem in terms of cost, quantity, capacity for progress and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Some practical measures have been taken, for an important project has been included in the list of projects of common interest which concerns two islands in the Community – Sardinia and Corsica – specifically, the gas pipeline which will convey a considerable amount of methane gas from Algeria to Italy, France and southern Germany. It has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority<span class="bold"> </span>projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that, if the European Parliament adopts my amendment, a further boost will be given to this project whose implementation is awaited by a significant part of Europe, and, if possible, to other projects, which will then be practically implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time the production of electricity and other forms of energy will go down in relation to consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Nordic countries have opened up our electricity markets. For example, in my own country, Finland, households have been able to choose their electricity supplier for many years now. This practice has worked well in the Nordic countries, and even Norway, a country outside the European Union, participates.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of renewable sources is increasing in our logistics system and limiting carbon dioxide emissions has also become a key issue. Natural gas is also growing in importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be on our guard against the emergence of monopolies and reliance on just one supplier, which would cause huge problems. Let us just recall how things went for Enron or how things are still going for a certain large company in Great Britain. Where are the largest and nearest energy resources from the Union’s point of view? They are in Russia. Now while the relevant Commissioner is listening attentively over there I would propose that, at the next summit between the European Union and Russia, an attempt at some sort of concrete agreement is made on energy, both gas and electrical energy, because we are very interested in both and we will be dependent on Russia for gas within 20 years or so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall use this speech to request a clarification in the annex providing for natural gas networks in the ultraperipheral regions.

<p class="contents">Section ‘E.07’ includes two new terminals in the Canary Islands. One, according to the text, in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and the other in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria.

No one would be, of course, if it were truly a matter of meeting the needs of the people. The real issue, however – as the report makes quite clear – is to make the construction and the maintenance of infrastructures in the field of energy subject to the laws of the market. In order to establish a more open and competitive internal market for energy, public funds supplementing private funds will rise from 10% to 20% of total investment. Members from the <span class="italic">Lutte ouvrière</span> are opposed to the use of public monies to increase private profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides which, the aim of increasing interconnection between gas and electricity networks is not to rationalise energy distribution at EU scale, but instead to open up the entire gas and electricity market to competition. What this means, where France, for example, is concerned, is another step closer to the privatisation of <span class="italic">Électricité</span> and <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span>, a process that we reject entirely. We reject it, as do the tens of thousands of workers who demonstrated on 3 October in Paris for <span class="italic">Électricité</span> and <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> to remain public services. We also oppose any attack on salaries or on the pensions of workers in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The various States or the European Community itself must be able to fund an energy transport network which is fit for the twenty-first century, whose management criteria are not profitability or the quest for profit for a few but which are to meet the energy needs of everyone and equal access for everyone. We do not think, however, think that by allowing themselves to be guided by private interests, the current European institutions will achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the magnificent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Beysen, and say that I see in general that the Commission and Parliament share the same point of view with regard to trans-European networks as an essential factor in facilitating the construction of the internal gas and electricity network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts the vast majority of the proposed amendments, with some changes to the wording in certain cases. These amendments supplement or clarify the Commission’s text. I shall provide the exact list of all the amendments and also indicate those we cannot accept as they contain guidelines which fall outside the scope of the Commission’s objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall concentrate, however, on explaining Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 11, which concern Annex III and, specifically, the use of the comitology process. In the interests of transparency and clarity, the Commission proposes that detailed descriptions of the projects should be included in the aforementioned Annex III to the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, with this level of detail, this Annex should be considered as a technical Annex and frequent and necessary decisions to update it should be taken in accordance with the comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to remind you that the use of the comitology procedure goes beyond trans-European networks and is currently the subject of an analysis of the interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions, and that the issues that Parliament might raise must be solved within this framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to point out that, in any case, the Commission will present an annual report on the development of the trans-European networks and the progress made with regard to the projects and, if possible, the amendments made to these in Annex III.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for supporting this proposal, Mr Beysen for his work, and all the speakers, and I hope we will also achieve a swift solution in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to inform colleagues in the Chamber that we have a very tight margin in category 3, for internal policies. It is only EUR 2.6 million. If, as a result of the vote, we pass the ceiling, I would feel obliged to propose offsets and further reductions on other budget lines. That is just a little warning.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are some technical corrections. First of all, amendment 662 on budget line B53004 (new) should not be subject to a separate vote because nobody has requested that. It has been listed as a separate vote by mistake. It should instead be voted on as part of block 4. I will check this with all the political groups but, as I understand it, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a technical adjustment in heading 5. The amendments proposed reflect the announcement by Eurostat on 15 October. We have new parameters for salaries in 2003. The 2.6% increase has now been reduced to 2%. The resulting adjustments to match the front loading in 2002 need to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I will quickly read the figures for the record. In Amendment 525, the final amount should be EUR 1 450 901 000 and nothing else. In Amendment 556,the final amount is EUR 68 890 436. In Amendment 650 on budget line A360, the final amount should read EUR 38 219 720.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have two new amendments, because we had no amendments on pensions. These are on budget line A1900, where the final amount should read EUR 412 887 000, and on budget line A6000, where the final amount should read EUR 124 456 000. In Amendment 562 on budget line A7000, the final amount should read EUR 54 916 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Amendment 527 on budget line A200, the final amount should be EUR 147 529 904.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have some technical corrections on agencies. There is a separate remark for the agency enlargement costs. They have now been slightly amended and should read as follows: for Amendment 583 on budget line B3-4201, the correct amount is EUR 7 150 000.</p>
<p class="contents">For Amendment 589, budget line B5-3111, the correct amount is EUR 300 000. For Amendment 596, budget line B5-8301, the final amount is EUR 3 522 711. Finally, we do not need a figure for Amendment 593, because it has been withdrawn. There is no enlargement cost in that case.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one item which has to be voted on and that is budget line A-3014, one of the A-30 lines about European masters' courses in human rights and democratisation. The reference here to the University of Padua is not correct. It should be replaced by the European Inter-University Centre. That is actually a new amendment to the draft budget and should be voted on at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell the House that, in order to be consistent with the resolution, I will ask the sessional services to replace the second part of the first paragraph of the grounds for Amendment 644 on Afghanistan by paragraph 26 in the resolution, so that there is no difference between the wording of the resolution and the amendment. I do not think that requires a vote, but I just wanted to point it out to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a politically more important point, because it concerns North Korea and the discussions we have had on KEDO and nuclear issues. Following the recent information on the declaration by the North Korean Government on the possible production of nuclear weapons, the Committee on Budgets, at its meeting this Monday, authorised me to table an oral amendment in plenary. This proposes that the EU's total contribution to KEDO, which is EUR 20 million, be entered in the reserve, on the grounds that the North Korean Government has admitted it is working on the research and production of nuclear weapons. This is clearly at odds with the general objectives of EU participation in the Euratom-Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation KEDO, which are 'to contribute to reinforcing and maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and to help achieve appropriate cooperation with both North Korea and South Korea to ensure the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy'.</p>
<p class="contents">The appropriations will be released from this reserve on the condition that, firstly, North Korea proves itself willing to respect the international non-proliferation regime and, secondly, that North Korea proves it has discontinued its nuclear weapons production programme. This is also a new amendment to the draft budget and must, preferably, be voted on at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, when we come to category 4, I shall comment on two specific aspects of that category, but that is all I wish to say at this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as the Council is now making a contribution to the frontloading operation, and given that Parliament will contribute almost EUR 43 million instead of EUR 40 million, which is what the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets decided on Monday evening, I propose that an amount of EUR 35 million should be taken back in 2003. Thus Parliament's net contribution will amount to EUR 8 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following Eurostat's new figure on salary adjustments, which is now reduced from 2.6% to 2%, the amounts entered in the different sections on staff expenditure also need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore suggest the following adjustments to the following amendments to reflect these changes. Amendment 493, section – Parliament: a reduction of EUR 1.9 million on item 1100. Amendment 715, section – Parliament: a reduction of EUR 3.1 million on item 209. Amendment 514, concerning the Court of Justice: a reduction of EUR 500 000 on item 1100. Amendment 516, concerning the Court of Auditors: a reduction of EUR 36 000 on item 1100. Amendment 520, on the Economic and Social Committee: a reduction of EUR 236 000 on item 1100. Amendment 522, on the Committee of the Regions: a reduction of EUR 102 000 on item 1100. Finally, Amendment 523, concerning the Ombudsman: a reduction of EUR 11 000.</p>

<p class="contents">Last Monday, we discussed East Timor in the Committee on Budgets, and I just want to explain what we are doing here. To maintain a separate budget line for East Timor – which is very politically important for the Timorese Government and for many others – a split vote has been requested on Amendment 674. In order to clarify the vote, I should like to explain that the split vote means that the first part will include the amounts. If we vote in favour of the first part, we vote in favour of the increased amount, which is EUR 25.5 million. As far as I know, that is acceptable to everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the vote concerns the nomenclature. If you want a separate line for East Timor – which is the rapporteur's recommendation, authorised by the Committee on Budgets – you should reject the second part of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has to be in Brussels this morning for discussions with the President, obviously on issues concerning the financing of enlargement and – equally obviously – before the Brussels European Council takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, on behalf of the Commission, I note with thanks Parliament's adoption of its negotiating position at this first reading on the 2003 draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, have supported a position that gives a reasonable prospect for a constructive and prudent 2003 budget at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will respond rapidly and fully to Parliament's various requests and queries in order to encourage early resolution of the outstanding points before second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have to finalise preparations for enlargement, but we are grateful to Parliament for its offers for 2002. That will obviously ease the problems in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make three other very brief points. Firstly, we must, and will, pursue the administrative reforms vigorously. A comprehensive progress report on reforms will be produced in January for Parliament to inspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we shall update the Union's agricultural budget and fisheries agreement needs for 2003. The Amending Letter will be put before the House next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission notes Parliament's concern that neither of our institutions is sufficiently involved in preparations for possible Common Foreign and Security Policy joint actions or in estimating the funding required for such actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the budget for external actions has yet to find a reasonable overall balance. The Commission will, consequently, propose realistic solutions in the coming weeks to help the budgetary authority reach satisfactory conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is because we think that the EU’s money can better be used in other areas where it is really needed. It is unreasonable for approximately half of the EU’s total budget to be spent each year on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products. As it stands, the common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU but also contributes to higher consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The export subsidies mean that the EU’s food surpluses are dumped on the world market at low prices so that the food industry is placed at serious competitive disadvantages in many developing countries, for example. The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly worth noting. The EU’s activities and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems that the Member States cannot solve themselves. The EU’s agricultural policy in the form of export and production subsidies should therefore be phased out and replaced in part by subsidies promoting biological diversity and environmental measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In general, we Swedish Christian Democrats share Parliament’s negotiating position on the issue of the budget. There are nonetheless a number of points of widely differing character that we should particularly like to comment on.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, before we can approve the whole of the proposed amount, it is important for the Commission to be able to clarify how the aid for Israel and Palestine is to be used. By approving, therefore, only half of the appropriation in the present situation, we are exerting pressure in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging that a start is being made on phasing out the subsidies for the transport of live animals, even though we should have preferred to have seen them removed completely.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sorry, however, that the aid for East Timor is being reduced, since the country is still in a phase of consolidation in the immediate aftermath of its declaration of independence. We believe it is wrong to provide subsidies, to the tune of EUR 7 million, to European parties until such time as there is a legal basis for doing so, and we regret that the proposal to remove the appropriation was voted down by 393 votes to 76.

The burden of the automatic increase in enlargement-related agricultural expenditure must not be borne by French farmers, and if farm subsidies were to be revised in 2006, this revision would, of course, have to include the Structural Funds and each country’s contribution to the European budget.</p>

The vote on the special function of the two parts of Amendment No 674, in terms that the roll-call vote makes quite clear, merely continues the spirit of intense cooperation and solidarity that the European Union has demonstrated towards the world’s most recent nation. Let us remember the award of the 1999 Sakharov Prize, by the European Parliament, to the current President of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, and the promise of assistance in consolidating the new nation, marvellously expressed in the European Parliament’s resolution of 4/10/2001. The processing of this specific budget line in Parliament rewards the attention, the tenacity and the excellent coordination between the Members who are best informed and best disposed towards East Timor, specifically the Portuguese Members from the various benches in this House. Given the extremely broad majority achieved in plenary, however, it is also a sign that Parliament remains equal to its political and moral responsibilities and is not breaking the commitments it has given to the Timorese people.

In order to ensure, however, that this proposal is based on a fruitful and objective debate, it is crucial that we have a rigorous and reliable understanding of the realities of the sector, both in terms of determining the urgency of the strategic decisions to be taken – especially<span class="italic"> </span>priority destinations and journeys – and in terms of measures to achieve a desirable reduction in road transport. This is the importance of this proposal for a regulation, which is intended to update and adapt rail transport statistics in order to be able to provide better monitoring and a more accurate analysis of developments in the sector, bearing in mind the measures that are to be adopted under the rail package. Now that we have reached this phase, I welcome the fact that a common position has been achieved in Council – with some amendments tabled by Parliament also being adopted – demonstrating that this is a subject that unites more than it divides and which could have an enormously positive impact on the quality of life of future European citizens.

One need only think of the significant reduction in air ticket prices and, consequently, the impressive increase in passenger numbers. To this we can add that the internal market itself is underpinned by the freedom of movement. There are, however, from the point of view of the passenger/consumer, certain aspects that need to be looked at once again, specifically with regard to the all too common practice of what is known as ‘overbooking’ by airlines and to those cases (not covered in the previous set of regulations) in which passengers are re-routed onto other flights which take them on to their final destination, albeit with some delay. The current situation has resulted in justifiable complaints from passengers, especially with regard to the disruption and trouble caused by delayed or cancelled flights. Many airlines have committed themselves to responding better to passenger expectations, but what is really needed is a new regulatory framework to protect passengers’ rights. This is the aim of the Commission proposal and also of the Lisi Report. I have voted in favour of this report, all the more because it has weighed up the various interests in this field and contains a set of reasonable compromises which, for this very reason, received the broad consensus of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1) The Commission's proposal has not undergone a proper economic impact assessment, to determine the potential effect on ticket prices and consumer choice. Such an assessment is fundamental to ensuring that the proposed system is sustainable in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">2) Both the proposal and Parliament's compromise fail to recognise the fundamental difference between the usual circumstances leading to denied boarding and those leading to cancellations. Whilst denied boarding usually results from deliberate overbooking, cancellation is very often due to circumstances beyond the airline's control – for example, air traffic control. Parliament's definition of ‘<span class="italic">force majeure</span>’ is an inadequate safeguard in this respect. Though one might argue that airlines should seek recourse against those actually responsible in such cases, this will be very complicated in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">3) Ultimately, particularly where budget carriers are concerned, it might be preferable to require airlines to offer consumers the option of paying a separate insurance premium, on top of the price of their ticket, thereby guaranteeing them compensation for cancellation and delay beyond the airline's control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This exerts pressure for the sector’s privatisation, including its infrastructures, and this is something we do not agree with.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the rapporteur claims that the aim of competition and completion of the internal energy market should be implemented in such a way as to allow for universal service obligations, the options it favours for supporting the funding of priority projects, even in tricky areas, cannot exceed 20% and then only in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, it goes further than the Commission proposal, which was only of 10%, but only mentions the construction phase, which remains subject to the non-distortion of competition between undertakings, which means advocating liberalisation in this field too and subjecting it to the criteria of economic rather than social benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more relevant in the case of the outermost regions such as the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores. This fact explains why I have been advocating a differentiated treatment of these regions, given their inability to link up with the European electricity and gas networks.

It corresponds, in fact, to the report by the European Parliament, adopted on 13 March 2002 at first reading, on the proposal for a regulation on promoting cross-border electricity trading. In fact, since such slow progress has been made in recent years, as the Commission states – with only 3 out of 14 specific projects having already been implemented – the rapporteur's suggestion to identify a new category of work is entirely appropriate. Indeed, within projects of common interest, there is a proposal to identify a category of priority projects of European interest. This category will include a limited number of energy network projects with a very significant impact from the point of view of the essential criteria of energy policy, in other words, to complete the internal market and to strengthen security of supply. I also agreed with the recommended guideline to link more closely the production of renewable energies to interconnected energy networks, thereby leading to a desirable increase in the production and consumption of these energies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Paragraph 6, the European Parliament appears to be saying that the legitimate right of a State which has been attacked to defend itself can only be exercised with the authorisation of the UN Security Council, which would appear to be entirely incorrect.

<p class="contents">In Paragraph 36, the European Parliament suggests that what is known as the ‘pillar’ structure of the European institutions could hamper the fight against terrorism, and this hardly makes any sense.

<p class="contents">- the reaffirmation of NATO and of partnership with the USA as a framework reference for the EU in the ‘fight against terrorism’;</p>
<p class="contents">- its support for the reform of NATO (its political and military structures) in order to change its defence alliance missions into an offensive alliance;</p>
<p class="contents">- its willingness to criminalise the action of organisations and movements that fight, sometimes by means of an armed struggle, against the repression with which their peoples are targeted, confusing these with ‘terrorism’;</p>

<p class="contents">Yesterday, however, all the political groups one by one welcomed the speed with which Europe reacted after 11 September. Of course, in the crisis, a common definition of terrorism was produced, although with difficulty. Moreover, Europol was given new responsibilities in this field and a list of unstable States harbouring fundamentalist cells was drawn up, but, a year later, the terrorist networks are still there and we are witnessing more and more terrorist attacks.</p>

Fear of terrorism has led to decisions which, under normal circumstances, would only be supported by a minority of this Parliament. Although EU Member States are more restrained than America with regard to preventive warfare and more prepared to make payments to Developing World countries, we are still significantly affected by the short-sighted policies of Bush junior. In preparing this resolution, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has made gains from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the Christian Democrats and Liberals have been able to largely impose their will on the Social Democrats and the Greens. This means that more importance is being attached to NATO than the United Nations and that the curtailment of the rights of freedom has been considered more important than removing the causes which make humiliated people into terrorists. This is exactly what it takes to ensure the enduring and increasing indignation of the victims of the current balance of power, ownership and income in the world. It is nice that the Liberal party still wants to add a charitable slant to this poor position but it does not change the effect.

The taking only yesterday of hundreds of innocent citizens hostage in a local theatre in Moscow, creating a new drama, the outcome of which is still completely unsure, has actually confirmed all of our greatest fears following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attack on Bali and various other actions dotted around the world. This brutal and increasingly terrifying climate, however, lays bare the vulnerabilities of modern society and should, for this very reason, counsel us against the ambiguities and the traps of pseudo-justification of which, unfortunately, the text of the resolution is full. Under the pressure of successive compromises, the text is too long and resembles nothing so much as a boring waltz or a tiresome tango, with steps to the left and to the right, forwards and backwards – to such an extent that, eventually, we even forget in which direction it is moving. Consequently, we do not get very far and terrorists of all hues will be able to keep on smiling as they target innocent and defenceless civilians and sow their hatred, brutality and destruction. A resolute fight against terrorism is one of the fundamental political fights at the dawn of this century if we do not wish to reach its close in a worse state than when it started. Without giving in to any political or moral buck-passing, the fight must be pursued by means of all available political, diplomatic, military, police and judicial instruments available, as circumstances on the ground and the effectiveness of dissuasion or suppression dictate, rejecting shilly-shallying that blames the victims and favour the aggressors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition there were references to diverse political concepts from CFSP to ESDP and the Echelon project. On these we have distinct policies which are well known and differ from those of the majority of this Parliament. Needless to say, we as a party condemn terrorist activities of all types everywhere and have as a country suffered at the hands of the brutal IRA and other paramilitaries for a very long time, so our abstention also reflects the rather weak tone of the resolution. In parts this seems to be more concerned with protecting the civil rights of terrorists than with condemning their murderous behaviour towards innocent civilians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this respect, Mr Kanbhai’s report gives me the opportunity to put paid to a rumour which is all too often spread about and which I consider to be erroneous, namely that the European Union is closed to exports coming from the world’s poorest countries. The implication is that we are falling short of our duty of solidarity towards the developing countries by implementing a protectionist agricultural policy focusing solely on European farmers.</p>

He recognises the right of every country to protect its products by raising tariff barriers and urges rich countries to open themselves up to exported products from the poorest countries in spite of all this. He also asks the wealthy countries to spend a minimum of 0.7% of their Gross National Product on development aid and recognises the need to redistribute agricultural land ownership. I hope his views are shared by his Christian Democratic and Conservative group colleagues. Unfortunately they have discovered a new priority during recent times. This is the priority of free trade, that is, support for the wrong kind of globalisation than is encouraged by the World Trade Organisation. If free trade is implemented, this will mean survival of the fittest. Companies with the lowest labour and environmental costs will then be able to steal the market from their competitors, wealthy countries will become richer at the expense of the poorest and the number of those excluded will grow at national level and world level. It is therefore delightful to see that a majority is now forming for an attitude which relies on solidarity rather than the opinion ‘you do not get anything for nothing’. Incidentally, I am aware that this relates to a non-legislative initiative proposal with few direct consequences in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is an urgent matter because the New Delhi Conference, to which the question refers, is now beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in particular, are very concerned that we should keep the Kyoto momentum going. In the European Union all is really not well, because some of the Member States that have ratified Kyoto are in the process of increasing their emissions of CO2, notably Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted a number of directives tending to decrease CO2 emissions, and the Commission has put forward a very useful programme showing what it has done and what it intends to do. We are particularly interested in the proposals on monitoring mechanisms, which are likely to come forward soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask three things. Firstly, how important is the New Delhi Conference? The Commissioner would say that it is very important. If so, then my next question is why is she here and is she planning to go? I am sure that if she is not planning to go, it is not a symptom of the downgrading of the status of the conference. We simply want to know what is likely to happen at New Delhi. We have heard conflicting rumours.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would be interesting to hear how the Commission thinks other countries could be encouraged to participate in the Kyoto process. For example, I recently met with the Australian Ambassador to the European Union. Australia is not a party to Kyoto and is clearly not planning to become one. Australia might not have major CO2 emissions, but it could lead the way in South East Asia – a very important area where increasing industrialisation is increasing those emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should sort out what the role of MEPs is when they attend such conferences. In the past, my colleagues have had increasingly uncomfortable experiences attending these conferences, for example the Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development. The Commission is always extremely helpful and briefs MEPs as much as possible, but our delegations are not part of the meetings held by the EU delegation as such. We cannot understand why we cannot be observers at that process. It is absurd for the representatives of the people of Europe to travel halfway round the world only to be spectators at a conference where the people negotiating on their behalf are not directly elected on a European mandate. We would like to see this changed so that we are at least given observer status in EU meetings at such conferences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, after Bonn and Marrakech, COP 8 is an opportunity to reinforce the commitments from developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and repeat calls on those countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so in the near future. The discussions at COP 8 in India will first of all deal with progress on implementation. That is to establish the state of play. The concerns of developing countries relate to adaptation to climate change and the initiation of a process for further action to be taken after 2012, for a second commitment period.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress of the Conference will be detailed in a daily declaration. However, if you ask how important this conference is compared with the others, I can say that no negotiations on major issues of substance are foreseen. So there is a difference between previous COP meetings and this one. This is not to say that it is not important, but it is not at the level of true negotiations as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">We can expect the developing countries to remind the industrialised world of our obligations under the climate convention when it comes to helping them in capacity building and adaptation to climate change. The European Union, together with other developed countries, wants to have an initial discussion on the process for deciding on further action for the second commitment period and to initiate this process in New Delhi. The Environment Council also called upon other countries to engage in a dialogue on this question last week.</p>
<p class="contents">I can anticipate that the role of the European Union will be to try to build bridges between Japan, the United States and other countries which would like to push the developing countries to move towards quantified commitments for the second commitment period, as of now. The developing countries are opposed to that and, of course, argue from a political standpoint that it is our role to lead the way, to show that we are serious about getting our greenhouse gas emissions down, before they will accept anything that could hamper their development. So this debate will probably start, but we in the European Union have said that we should concentrate on establishing the process, because our first objective is for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force. We should not let anything stop us from reaching that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission together with Member States will use COP 8 to emphasise the importance of implementing the Kyoto Protocol and the agreements reached in Bonn and Marrakech. We welcome the various points raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2 October and we will take them on board as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that we will pursue at COP 8 is also a follow-up to the coalition of the willing on renewable energy that the European Union launched in Johannesburg. We will discuss the way forward with like-minded countries and encourage others to join in.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force once 55 parties representing at least 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 have ratified the Protocol. So far, 95 countries representing 37.1% of emissions have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, representing around two thirds of the world population. The speed of ratification, and this concerns your second question, Mrs Jackson, increased before and during the World Summit in Johannesburg. Such events often trigger this kind of reaction. That is fine, but the important thing is to get the countries to ratify the Protocol and to make progress in implementing it. Canada and Russia said, during the World Summit, that they intent to ratify it, while major developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, have by now done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that what is most important now is to continue to put pressure on Russia, because we know that the ratification by Russia, which represents 17.4% of emissions, is vital to reach the 55% threshold needed for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force. We are, of course, in contact with the Russian authorities and we are closely following progress on ratification in Russia. My colleague and I have urged other parties, with whom we have bilateral meetings, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and we are continuing to do so. We have done all we can, travelling around the world talking to Australia and other countries in the everyday bilateral context, drawing attention to this issue and to the importance of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. So we are continuing to call on the US and Australia to return to the Kyoto process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European climate change programme Mrs Jackson referred to was launched on 8 March 2000 and has identified key elements for a cost-effective EU-wide strategy to combat climate change. Our communication last year outlined a first package of ten measures with a cost-effective reduction potential of between 122 and 178 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. That is nearly halfway towards our Kyoto target of -8%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already presented proposals for a number of these measures, including an EU emissions trading scheme, the energy performance of buildings, co-generation and a strategy to increase the use of biofuels in road transport. Others, such as legislation on minimum energy efficiency standards for end use equipment or the promotion of energy services and on fluorinated gases, are in the pipeline. But is true that some of our Member States will have to take serious steps to deal with the current trend when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. You cannot afford to be lax in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport has been identified as one of the more intractable sectors, with carbon dioxide emissions from transport the fastest growing, despite the progress made through our agreement with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The Commission has indicated that changes in current mobility patterns need to be a high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the role of MEPs, the MEPs I met yesterday, who will be in the delegation going to India, find it frustrating that often they are in the same group as the NGOs. As observers, they will not have access to the negotiations or to the round table discussions in New Delhi.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had Members of the European Parliament in the European Communities delegation at previous COPs in Bonn and Marakesh. On both occasions I appreciated and enjoyed the outstanding cooperation with the EP delegation. It has been very helpful to have the Members of the European Parliament present and active on those occasions and at bilateral meetings with other parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter to President Cox, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, recently confirmed that, on the basis of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission, the Commission could accept the inclusion of eight Members of the European Parliament as observers in our Community delegation for COP 8. The inclusion of the MEPs in the COP delegation follows the established rules on the presence of Members of Parliament in delegations to international conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided, after our discussion yesterday, that we on the Commission side will do everything we can to see whether some parts of the round table discussions could be made public or opened up to Members of the European Parliament, but we are in the hands of a UN organisation, so we can only ask. You will then need to ask the Council and the Member States whether it would be possible to participate in coordination meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue will have to be raised in a more general context, because it concerns not only the MEPs attending this and other climate change meetings, but also other international fora. It is important to sort out for the future the different roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Member States and Members of the European Parliament. Now is probably not the time to change all the rules in the existing agreement, but later on it should be taken to a more general level and clear rules established for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have appreciated enormously the cooperation with Members of the European Parliament. I hope that will continue at COP 8 in India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would say that, in terms of the EU’s new political agenda, there is a set of three objectives in this field that must be achieved in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, ensuring that the Protocol will enter into force. In order for this to happen, Russia must ratify the Protocol. The problem, however, is that Russia has already promised on several occasions that it would ratify the Protocol and this has not yet happened. I ask the Commissioner, what type of concrete political and diplomatic initiatives are being and will be adopted in conjunction with the Russian Government to ensure that the Protocol is urgently submitted for ratification in the Duma?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe it is important not to give up – and in fact we cannot give up – attempting to convince the US administration to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol. The directive on emissions trading will help the European campaign to persuade the Americans to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol. Let us say that, with emissions trading, we will be able to demonstrate that it is possible to comply with Kyoto at less economic cost. I do feel, however, that on this issue too, embarking on a charm offensive is not enough. We must take Kyoto to the next round at the World Trade Organisation. And I wish to ask the Commission, is it prepared to submit an initiative to the next World Trade Organisation round, that guarantees the elimination of competitive and legitimate advantages that American products will gain as a result of their economy not being covered by the Kyoto Protocol?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr President, I believe it is important for the European Union to strengthen its international leadership on the basis of action rather than words. On this matter, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the excellent work she is doing in this field. The Commission has demonstrated its ability to take the initiative, not least in its directive on emissions allowance trading and in the European Programme on Climate Change, but I do feel that this is a serious political problem: where the Member States are concerned, we are seeing real paralysis. I believe it is crucial, for the sake of the credibility of our leadership, that the Member States also start to take action. With regard to the role of Parliament’s delegation in New Delhi, I would emphasise the words of its Chairman, Caroline Jackson: the parliamentary delegation must be allowed to attend the daily meetings held by the EU representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political leadership on this issue is incredibly important. I also think that the way in which the EU has dealt with the issue via the Commission has been excellent. These issues need nonetheless, in the future too, to go on being given a high profile. It is not acceptable for there to be certain Member States that do not really take the issue seriously and that, instead of reducing emissions, are tending to do the opposite. Almost the same situation applies too to the candidate countries that wish to become members of the EU but that have still not ratified the treaty. We must continue to exert pressure and say that we require ratification if membership is to become possible. What we expect first and foremost from the New Delhi conference is political leadership and the maintenance of a strong political message from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important issue, even if we are now beginning to understand that it will probably not be possible to concentrate on it, is about what will happen during the next commitment period. What, then, will happen after 2012? What shall we do? What are the objectives? I should also like to put these issues to Mrs Wallström. What is it intended should happen during the forthcoming period? Does the Commission already have plans as to how matters need to proceed? What demands are to be made, and how are we to make progress in solving the problem of climate change?</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to our role in relation to the developing countries. We quite often point out the need to ensure we help the developing countries fulfil what is required of them by the Kyoto Protocol. How are we to do this in purely practical terms?</p>
<p class="contents">We have today voted on the EU budget at first reading. There will of course be a second reading, but it is difficult to see where climate issues in particular fit into the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat Parliament’s old demands, it should soon no doubt be time to incorporate shipping and aviation into these talks. That has still not happened, but it is no doubt desirable that it should. Even if these issues cannot perhaps be among those raised in New Delhi, it is nonetheless important that we make these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to repeat the principle on the basis of which I think this discussion ought to proceed and which, in actual fact, gave rise for once to some discussion at the most recent meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I mean that we must seek equal rights for all citizens of the world. The committee certainly adds the rider that this is to happen in the long term, but what is nonetheless required is for all citizens to have the right of access to good, renewable energy on equal terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, we must correct recital C of the motion for a resolution we tabled, because this recital states that 83 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol but – as the Commissioner so rightly said – at the beginning of October, 95 countries had ratified it, which equates to 37.1% of CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are going to repeat ourselves; I believe we all agree that some matters should take priority – as the Commissioner said – succeeding in persuading Russia, by means of all the necessary diplomatic steps and pressure, to sign the Protocol would mean exceeding 55% of emissions, which would enable us to consider the Kyoto Protocol implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, sadly, my country is no example when it comes to reducing emissions, but rather the opposite. We need to put pressure on the various countries so that they continue to fulfil the commitments we have all undertaken, and there is no doubt that renewable energies will play a very important part in this direction we are taking, in addition to transport, despite the poor result achieved in Johannesburg with regard to renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to instigate a debate in New Delhi on objectives beyond 2012, on means and mechanisms for sanctions and on conflict-resolution mechanisms, could be of great importance for the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall end by referring to the role of the Members of the European Parliament in these summits which – as the Commissioner so rightly said – should be substantial, but not because we want to be present in every single discussion, but because I believe we can be of help to the Commission and to those who are determined that the Kyoto Protocol should become reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, how should we interpret this debate, which is being held after the opening of the Conference, if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change? We must ask ourselves whether the latest UNEP report, which revealed that USD 150 billion is spent on environmental damage each year, escaped the scrutiny of certain European visionaries. Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen of this House. I do not mean you.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, how do you intend to convince your fellow Commissioners of the urgent need for practical measures? In New Delhi, what we actually need to do is to increase the international reaction to the threat of climate change a little more. This momentum, which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible, must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, as defined at Bonn and Marrakech.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to be a driving force in combating climate change. At New Delhi, we must also pave the way for the second period, as you have said, and prepare to address requirements which are more pressing because of the gravity of the situation, and we know that time is of the essence.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three essential points we must uphold in New Delhi. Firstly, as regards carbon wells, which distort the true environmental picture, scientific rigour and objectivity exclude this simple solution, this expedient. Secondly, it is imperative that the surge in air traffic and its impact on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are included in the process. What is the Commission’s current view on this? Thirdly and lastly, the COP 8 must not fail to condemn the attempt to include nuclear power as a renewable energy, for nuclear power is limited and even obsolete. For example, Amendment No 15 to our resolution, seeking to reinstate it, must be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no more urgent subject for us and our debates than the potential future impact of climate change. There is nothing more essential in politics than the very essence of all politics: the continued survival and proper functioning of the Earth itself. We must act now to give ourselves the chance of a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that we are preparing for New Delhi, the Kyoto Protocol is still not in force, however. Obviously we cannot have complete control over the world just like that. Certainly not when we consider that man has limited influence over CO2 emissions. Technically speaking there are vast sources of CO2 emissions and CO2 wells. It is therefore only to be expected that emissions caused by man have only a limited effect on the overall amount. However, we still have a duty to limit CO2 emissions as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A glance at the conference programme shows me that specific matters relating to the implementation are up for discussion. The emphasis being placed on wind energy, cooperation with third countries and emissions trading schemes is a positive development. In my opinion the European Union can make a substantial contribution towards projects for clean development in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU already has a pioneering role to play with regard to emissions trading schemes. Parliament has chosen to implement an unambiguous and well-thought-out system to be introduced in 2005. Economies can be made by businesses being more frugal with energy and the link with the overall energy policy is of course very important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to CO2 wells I would like to point out the danger that we might overestimate in our accounting for CO2 wells in, for example, the ocean. As the water warms up, its capacity for absorbing CO2 will fall again.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union ratified the Protocol six months ago. Let us hope that the New Delhi climate conference will result in ratification by the Russian and Canadian Governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, though, a pity that, realistically speaking, no serious political progress is expected in New Delhi because people are in fact hoping for something else. After the dreadful floods in Germany and neighbouring countries, people expected the climate problem to be resolved once and for all in Johannesburg, only to be told that it had a different agenda. The same appears to be true of New Delhi, but we must continue to be tough negotiators, even if we cannot always make rapid progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that Kyoto is, of course, just the first step, which is why we reiterate quite clearly in our resolution that all citizens must end up with the same rights, which basically means that per capita emissions should be the same the world over. For the developing countries, this implies a great deal more than we promised in Kyoto. In view of the recent debate on emissions trading in Germany, we have to keep reminding ourselves that all the parties in Germany are in fact agreed that we need to reduce emissions in the long term by 80% – I repeat 80% by 2050 – and if we are already arguing so energetically against it now, when first steps need to be taken, then I do not hold out much hope for this long-term objective. Nonetheless, we must stand by it and our resolution reaffirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">Ratification by Russia, Japan and the USA is still very, very important. As we have been told on numerous occasions, all we can do is keep on making demands and ensuring that every meeting, at whatever level, between representatives of the European Union, be it the Commission or the Council of Ministers or us here in the European Parliament, between the EU and the USA, between the EU and Russia, addresses this issue. It must be our top priority in our dealings with these countries. We must not relax in our efforts and I expressly endorse what Mr Moreira Da Silva said about the WTO. We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the European Union is, of course, vital. We have to clean up our own act. Parliament has, by a very large majority, taken a clear stand on emissions trading. I am sorry that the Council of Ministers has postponed its decision yet again and I am sorry to hear from initial reactions that important amendments which we adopted, for example on the CAP or on 1990 as the base year, may not meet with the Council's approval. The Council needs to adopt a clear concept, and quickly, and we, the European Parliament, need to be tough negotiators. That is all I have to say. Three minutes is too short a time to expand on the whole issue but I think it really is important for us to keep clarifying our position here in this House.</p>

I have something to say to the members of the parliaments. We have more and more global processes, not just now with Kyoto, but on other issues – I am thinking of the International Monetary Fund, financial policy, worldwide credit policy, environmental policy and trade policy – which are in fact decided solely by the executive. The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice. The question is: surely, with increasing globalisation, parliaments could be more involved in the opinion-forming process? This question is directed both to us and to our parliaments. We need to find new ways of working together instead of just taking recourse to the executive – in this case the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Kyoto must be ratified and that will be our main job in New Delhi. We must convince our counterparts, especially our Russian counterparts, that this makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when we talk of reducing CO2 – and other greenhouse gas emissions, but mainly CO2 – we always mention renewable energy in the same breath. And so we should. I have no wish to contradict that. It is just that, in New Delhi, we will be in a country that generates well over 50% of its electricity from coal. If they could bring their coal technology up to current European standards, we would save much, much more CO2 throughout the world than with all the other very costly reduction measures put together. This is a fact and we must face it. In other words, if we want a climate policy, we need an active coal policy and we should mention that in the same breath as renewable energy, because 80% of the world's energy is still generated from fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that climate policy also gives us a chance to foster a new relationship with developing countries, in the form of emissions trading. The Commission itself conducted a very interesting study in its institute in Seville, with a time frame of up to 2030, when, it states, emissions trading with Asia will be worth around EUR 80 billion. That implies a capital inflow of around EUR 80 billion for these countries. Know-how will be transmitted to these countries and the advantage to us is that the reduction in emissions will be entered against our account, meaning that both sides will benefit from the trade off. We should be thinking more along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, as has already been stated, equal rights to emit CO2 per world citizen at a sustainable level is also written in the Parliamentary resolution. How does the Commission feel about this idea? That will mean that India will be allowed to emit double its current amount, China must stabilise, Europe must reduce its emissions by 80% and the US by 90%.

I should like to reiterate what Mrs Annelie Hulthén said, namely that we must make sure that future Member States of the European Union understand that this is one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue -– and at this time and at this conference, which should not be taking place anyway, this probably has less to do with specific negotiations and more to do with thinking up a strategy and enumerating its features – is how we can convince numerous developing countries to join the fight against climate change in the future. This will of course depend on our own credibility when it comes to climate change. In other words, Europe and the European Union must deliver satisfactory results here. Our success or failure in achieving this credibility with our partners in the developing countries – for whom I realise, Commissioner, this will not be easy – will not depend solely on our environmental policy; it will also depend on whether we have coherent policies in other sectors, such as European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">One point, which has not yet been raised today but which I consider very important, is the question of monitoring. I think that, if we want the Kyoto Protocol to be a success and deliver demonstrable results, then we need a reasonable, reliable monitoring system. In other words, we must ensure that the Member States deliver reliable figures on their emissions and on the flexible mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need reliable data on what Europe sees as the very negative question of planting, in other words reforestation and similar activities.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, which numerous members have raised, is of course the question of what happens after 2012, at the end of the first period, and it seems to me that we can make good use of COP 8 if we avoid getting embroiled in finer points and negotiations in order to table this problem and start thinking now about what must and will happen in 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, what can we do to influence Russia and to push for ratification from the Russian side? It is difficult to talk to the Russians. We have for some time now been planning a troika visit to Russia and we are continuing to plan for that visit because we want to meet the right people. We want to have it at a high political level in order to have a meaningful discussion. In all bilateral talks, including those between Commissioner Prodi and Prime Minister Putin, climate change and the Kyoto Protocol have been on the agenda. Of course we raise this issue in all our bilateral contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware of a study that has just been published by the Russian Government on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. We are currently analysing the results – hopefully we will be able to use some of them in our ongoing debate. We are keeping a close eye on what happens in Russia, in order to be able to use the positive forces that exist in Russia. In the end, I suppose that it is Prime Minister Putin who will decide.</p>
<p class="contents">What about a WTO initiative? That has not yet been included in our plans at all. Maybe that is a good idea. I have not though about it enough to give you a really considered answer today, but I am worried about anything that could complicate or halt the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. We should be very careful not to raise the issue in such a way that we create more stumbling blocks in the debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. I would be happy to come back to the debate on the WTO and the links between these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens in the second commitment period? First of all, we are interested in establishing the process in Delhi and COP8. It is too early and in view of the risk of complicating the whole debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, we want first of all to establish the process and decide how to get to the second commitment period. It seems a little pointless to go into the details on that before the Kyoto Protocol has even entered into force. So first things first. We have to stick to that strategy at COP8 as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one question on air traffic. Of course the Commission and the European Union are working within ICAO, because this is clearly an international issue. I am sure we would all agree that the work in ICAO has not been satisfactory when it comes to speed and commitment, but it also has a UNCCC mandate to work on the climate change issue. This is an area where we can hopefully do more, but we will have to continue to work in an international context.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what about equal rights per world citizen? The ultimate goal is to stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels. Remember that. We need to reduce emissions as a result. I believe this will lead to convergence of per capita emissions internationally. Whether equal rights is the right target, I cannot say. I do not want to say to the European Parliament that it is a ridiculous idea, but my personal opinion is that it might not be the most sensible approach. It is a moral concept rather than an environmental measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main objective is to protect the environment. That, I believe, is how we should formulate it. We emit eight times more, on average, than an Indian citizen. How do we create equal rights for citizens throughout the world? I would like to approach it from an environmental point of view, so that we make sure that we stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels. I hope you understand my argument. Perhaps this is something which requires further debate. We have an important role to play in New Delhi, in the COP8 discussions, because we can definitely work with the developing countries. We will probably be the bridge between G77, China and the developed countries in the debate on how to deal with climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, we successfully applied for the final vote on the issue of genetically modified organisms to be deferred. I then negotiated for two years on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture. The issue at stake then was not whether genetic engineering should or should not be used; the issue at stake was labelling and the inclusion of this seed directive and its methods in the release directive, which at the time was still Directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">We achieved this. At the time, the scientists still insisted that genetically modified crops could coexist alongside non-genetically modified crops; they excluded the possibility of contamination. This stand has now been overtaken both by events and by opinion within the scientific community itself. Now those who wish or rather who, under the bio regulation, are legally obliged to farm – be it conventionally or organically – without using genetic engineering, face the problem of unwanted contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the Commission wants to set a threshold below which no labelling is required. This is where the figures start to get confusing. Once upon a time there was talk of 1% contamination; now we are down to 0.3 and 0.5%. But the fact remains that genetically modified organisms are being released unintentionally in huge quantities. If we relate this to an area of seven-and-a-half or eight million hectares of rape or corn, 7 million plants seed every year. This is not going to be negotiated with Parliament, not even in the Standing Committee on the release directive, which has now been renewed; it is to be decided in the Standing Committee on Seeds, where a ruling is to be laid down under the comitology procedure which, if implemented as it stands, contradicts Parliament's figure of 0.5% in the food labelling directive.</p>
<p class="contents">If we approve seeding in these quantities without labelling, then we must assume that the other value will be exceeded during seeding and that even those who do not use any form of genetically modified organism will be forced to comply with labelling and testing requirements. We need a ruling here which clarifies once and for all – and this is also the position which the Committee on Agriculture has just adopted – that there has to be coexistence, that those who wish to use genetically modified organisms must ensure that those who do not are not brought into contact with them. That applies both to the 70% of farmers in Germany who do not want GMOs and to about the same percentage of consumers who do not want GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is no point in starting from a specific threshold because, if it is exceeded, the risk and the individual costs will be impossible to bear under compensation rules. So we need a ruling whereby those who are to blame can be held to account under the polluter-pays principle. This process, these rulings are no simple matter, Commissioner, and cannot be decided under the comitology procedure or in the standing committee and technical annex; they need further debate and another vote, with codecision by Parliament. We should also hold science to account and organise hearings in order to clarify how coexistence which is really worth its name, can be applied. All this takes time and must not, under any circumstances, be rushed. Until then, the rule must be that uncontaminated seed can be guaranteed for those who do not want to use genetically modified organisms.</p>

We still do not have a clear-cut reply to some of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's questions. Please accept that my answers are to some extent preliminary ones, which will require further scrutiny and reflection, both within the Commission and in our ongoing discussions with the Member States and the different stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin with a short description of the problem we are faced with when dealing with the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional products. This is also important for everyone who has followed this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On a global scale, GMO cultivation has increased dramatically in recent years. In 2001, 5.5 million farmers in 13 countries grew an estimated 52.6 million acres with GM crops. Between 2000 and 2001, the number of acres planted to GM crops increased by almost 20%. For some crops, the increase was particularly large. In the US, GM corn increased from 4.4% of all planted acres in 1996 to 32% in 2002. GM soya beans increased from 7.4% in 1996 to 74% in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the cultivation of GMOs has been geographically concentrated, with 99% of all GM crops produced by four nations: the United States of America, Argentina, Canada and China. However, GM cultivation is likely to spread to other nations in the next few years. So far Europe has played a very marginal role, with fewer than 20 000 acres of GM crops, mainly in Spain and France. That is some 0.03% of the worldwide area.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has large volumes of trade with major GM producers – although trade in GM products has mainly concerned products for animal feed. Imports of GM products for human consumption, like maize, have largely ceased, because of the inability of exporters to ensure the identity of all individual GMOs in shipments.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few years have shown that the adventitious presence of traces of GMOs in conventional products has become inevitable. Cross-pollination between plants is a natural phenomenon – that also happens between other seeds. We simply cannot completely control its mechanisms, which include factors such as wind and insect movements. It is therefore largely unavoidable that small traces of GMOs will be transferred to conventional crops and their harvested products.</p>
<p class="contents">Storage and transportation practices may also make it difficult or extremely costly to ensure total segregation. Consequently, conventional seed lots will contain traces of GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting tolerance thresholds for impurities for GM seeds in this particular case is the only way to address the problem. Closing our market completely is not a viable option.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a Commission directive amending the annexes to the seed directives. This proposal includes additional conditions and requirements concerning the adventitious presence of GM seeds in lots of non-GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture has been informed twice about the status of this proposal. Commissioner Byrne has written to inform Mrs Jackson that the text will be formally submitted to the European Parliament, which will then have the opportunity to scrutinise it.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 21(2) of Directive 18/2001/EC provides for the possibility of establishing thresholds below which traces of authorised GMOs are exempted from labelling requirements. Hence, conventional products containing adventitious traces of such GM seeds below this threshold would not have to be labelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now answer some of the questions raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. On the competent body to set thresholds, the Regulatory Committee, provided for in Directive 18/2001/EC, is competent for decisions pertaining to thresholds under Article 21(2) of the directive, with regard to exemption from labelling requirements. However, it is not competent for decisions made under the sector-specific seeds directives, where thresholds relate specifically to marketing criteria for seeds. The Standing Committee on Seeds rightly has the necessary competence in this case. Consistency between the different pieces of legislation has to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">On the risks that a significant percentage of GM seeds may be released out of control into the environment, I would first say that it is paramount that any threshold should take account of the protection of human health and, importantly, in the case of seeds, the environment. You will be aware that this includes a comprehensive free-market assessment of the potential risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, thresholds must be workable and enforceable. The proposed thresholds arise directly from the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants and are scientifically founded with reference to the characteristics of the crop species.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the registration of GMO cultivation, under the provisions of Article 31(3)(b), Member States are required to establish registers for recording the location of GM fields grown for commercial purposes. As detailed in the article, the objective of this is to allow the possible effects of these GMOs on the environment to be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the scope of Directive 18/2001/EC, this clearly relates to cultivation of a GM seed product itself and not a conventional seed product containing traces of GM seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The GM seed product itself has to be labelled as such and also traced, so that growers will know what they are sowing. It will therefore be possible for Member States to record the locations of the resultant crops.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the threshold values, which are based on robust scientific assessment, should aim at ensuring that the cultivation of conventional seeds basically maintains the characteristics of non-GM cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">Coexistence is a key issue in the Commission communication on Life Sciences and Biotechnology – a Strategy for the Future. The Commission has commissioned a number of studies on this issue. The main aim is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence. So far, we only have preliminary data based on hypothetical scenarios, and further experimental data is required to provide a more accurate picture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively pursuing such work before considering possible options to ensure the viability of conventional and organic farming and their sustainable coexistence with GM crops.</p>
<p class="contents">As a further step in this process, the Commission has commenced discussions in partnership with Member States, farmers and other private operators to find the most appropriate solutions. It is important to say that the issue of coexistence is not one of risk <span class="italic">per se</span>. It does, however, highlight a possible need to establish correct agricultural management systems and practices for the different crop types to ensure their coexistence and consumer choice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my initial reply to your questions and I will be happy to make further comments at the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is thus possible to set thresholds for GM presence in non-GM varieties through a comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1% food labelling threshold provided for in a Council regulation has been set by the comitology procedure provided for under the foodstuff labelling legislation.

I have said that I think it would make more sense if the Commission held fire on the regulation for GMOs in seed under the comitology procedure until Parliament has completed the current procedure. We need the new seed regulations to be consistent with the regulations on GMOs in food and feed and on the traceability and labelling of GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues were hotly debated at first reading here in this House as recently as the summer. The resolution was extremely tight on several points, especially the question of threshold values. We are now waiting for the Council of Ministers to reach a decision, which since last week has again been postponed to December. A final decision by the Council cannot now be expected before the middle of next year. I think it would be far better if the Commission were to keep its paper in the pending tray for another year, so that the threshold values can be adjusted to the regulations currently on the agenda. So much for the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for a brief material comment. The question of whether GMOs are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today's debate. But as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf refers in his question to positions on GMOs, I wish to do likewise. It is clear from all the Member's questions that there is something he has failed to understand or does not wish to admit. There is a difference between releasing GMOs under Directive 2001/18, on the one hand, and setting a technical limit value for the adventitious presence of GMOs in conventional seed by amending the annexes to the seed directives, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives contain an array of technical rules and requirements on the quality and marketing of seed in the EU. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself said that the actual directives were adopted in the usual manner after hearing the European Parliament and that it was decided in the process that certain technical details were to be regulated under the regulatory committee procedure. The committee does not of course decide on the release of GMOs, it decides how to define a further quality standard for conventional seed and it has the jurisdiction to do so under current EU law. The Commissioner said as much.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific committee has, in its turn, confirmed, as do countless other scientific works, that statistically halfway reliable statements do not brook a limit value of less than 0.1%. This is the cut-off point. There is no such thing as a 0% value, and nothing is GM-free. The Commission draft suggests threshold values for GMOs that do not represent a risk to the environment and consumers, and which can therefore be commercially cultivated in the EU. The registration requirements in Directive 2001/18 have nothing to do with the marketing of conventional seed.</p>
<p class="contents">Reproduction seed, which farmers themselves cultivate, is at times much more of a problem. It is not subject to any quality testing requirements whatsoever and does not therefore undergo any tests to detect GMOs. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself is in favour of liberalising these reproduction regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">And another thing. The lower the threshold value for the adventitious presence of GMOs is set, the more conventional and organic products will have to be labelled, which is why the Commission, various Member States and a large majority in the European Parliament are calling for a realistic limit value of 1% in the forthcoming GMO regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, may I say that working farmers need a fundamental understanding of the simple biologic facts of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of type A seed in type B. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf works as a farmer. There are such things as natural events. There will always be GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not just on the mind of my group, it is, of course, also on Mrs Sommer's mind. As she said, we worked together with an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment on this issue, precisely because we have the impression that our right of codetermination is being curtailed, whatever the legal situation here; I think we all know that, Mrs Sommer. We have asked the Commission and various representatives working on this directive for a deferment on several occasions, because the message we keep getting is that the idea is to railroad these legal provisions through before the end of the year. The legislation in this area, which is currently being dealt with by the Council but which was dealt with by Parliament at first reading up to July, signals that we are taking this seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall resist the temptation to rehash the debate we held up to July, but I should like to comment on one point which is, of course, also addressed in the legislation and which, as rapporteur, I am familiar with, namely the regulation on genetically modified food and feedingstuffs. What we want to know is: what is being done to prevent technically unavoidable, unwanted contamination? What proposals does the Commission have for investigating this question? Word is spreading that we are in fact regulating something at European level. We are regulating limit values, threshold values for technically unavoidable, adventitious contamination. We all agree here that we need these limit values and that there is no such thing as completely 'GM-free'. At the same time, we are not saying that there are laws in the pipeline, there are recommendations in the pipeline tackling how this can be avoided in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If the objective – and here too we agree with the Commission – is to deny this contamination and if the objective is the coexistence of various types of farming, such as traditional and organic farming, then this is a question we really should be asking ourselves. If the Commissioner says that there are no clear-cut replies to these questions, which is perfectly understandable, then I understand even less why this is now being railroaded through here under the comitology procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have translated her Portuguese notes off the cuff, so I hope I shall be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption by the Commission of Directive 2001/18/EC on the release into the environment of GMOs, there are serious concerns relating to health, the environment and farmers’ interests. As we know, beyond the ethical issues concerning the commercialisation and patentability of life and natural heritage, the release of GMOs into the environment is irreversible and difficult to control, and can have direct consequences for the contamination of conventional agriculture and the reduction of biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, even farmers who do not cultivate genetically modified plants, due to cross-pollination or similar phenomena, are forced to label their products. This could lead to conventional farmers or organic farmers not having any choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the absence of detailed studies, does the Commission not think that the precautionary principle of maintaining the moratorium in place should prevail? How should we address the labelling of products which contain GMOs due to chance or circumstances that are difficult to avoid? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said absolutely nothing about how we are to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on a limit value of 0.5% for labelling. That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating. With your planned limit value for seed, this value is not achievable. You know that, which is why I should now like to ask you to tell us what conclusions you intend to draw from this vote by Parliament. Is it in fact that you want to press ahead, that you want to bring about a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, that you want, as it were, to give the seed industry a Christmas present? I think you should state here today how you intend to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You said just now that contamination is unavoidable. That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable! In saying this, you are setting yourself up as the mouthpiece of the genetic engineering industry because that is what the lobby claims, but it is not true. Tests in Europe have shown that there is no contamination of seed of any consequence and in Austria we even have purity requirements for seed and I think that is exactly what we need. We need freedom of choice for consumers and, in order to guarantee it, we need purity requirements. We should not just throw in the towel in the face of contamination when, with the right policy, there is no contamination, because products or seeds which cause such widespread contamination cannot be released. So what we need is freedom of choice for consumers and, please, rather than giving Christmas presents to the seed industry, give us a timetable today. We want to know what the Commission is planning to do and if it really is prepared to accept Parliament's democratic resolution and wait until we have adopted a resolution on the Scheele Report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I understand that the Commission chooses the quantitative detectability techniques in order to define the adventitious presence of GMOs. That I quite understand. In fact, you sometimes even disregard the 1% adventitious presence of GMOs because – and I agree with you here – the authorisation for the circulation of a given GMO comes under a different directive, which takes into account the risks for human health and the environment. If there is no risk to human health and the environment, an authorisation is given.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it comes to the directives on traceability, for some peculiar reason, you do not follow the principle of detectability which you follow for all the others. This will also create problems for the World Trade Organisation, because if you accept that the presence of 1% is not a problem for health and so on, why do you not accept that detectability should be included in all traceability directives? If GMOs are present, whether adventitious or not, that fact should be stated.</p>
<p class="contents">You insist on not including detectability in the traceability directives. You must abide by what you have said, namely, that all directives should be part of the same framework.

We are not discussing the release of GMOs, but the definition of a further quality standard in the marketing of conventional seed.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament adopted the proposal for a regulation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs or genetically modified food and feedingstuffs at first reading in June, calling for a threshold value of 0.5%. I agree with the Commission here that this value is pitched too low and is impracticable. A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In setting threshold values for seed, which is what we are discussing here, the Commission has to take due account of Parliament's and the Council's suggested thresholds in the procedure mentioned. The threshold values for the adventitious presence of GMOs need to be coordinated in the two texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of GMOs in food and feed. Reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs. That needs to be made perfectly clear here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority. Coexistence is only possible if we have reasonable threshold values as, technically, wind-borne pollen can never be discounted in nature. One hundred percent purity was never possible for biological reasons and never will be in the future. Threshold values for product purity are standard and necessary in numerous industries. In the organic farming sector, for example, there is a threshold value of 5%. That means that products labelled as organic products may contain up to 5% of certain non-organic ingredients. I say that for the benefit of the Greens.</p>
<p class="contents">The important criterion must be that the statutory framework is practicable. More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and must not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe by tying it up in unnecessary red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I therefore ask if the Commission agrees that a Eurobarometer survey shows that 75% of Europeans favour basic research aimed at new technologies which help knowledge to progress? Is it true that, according to Eurobarometer surveys, 48% of Europeans agree or strongly agree that GM is useful in food production for improved nutrition and for improving shelf life or taste, despite the emotive campaign by the Greens to convince them of the contrary?</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are these campaigns emotionally charged, they muster distorted and misleading information to support their ultimately untenable and irrational opposition to the new technology of genetically modified crops. I wish they would be honest enough to recognise that there are at least some benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these actual benefits, not to mention the potential benefits, substantially outweigh any risks. Yes, there are always potential risks in any new technology product or process. We are challenging the frontiers of knowledge, but we have safeguards in place. We require exhaustive testing and trials in laboratory and field. But the opponents do not want proof. They condone obstruction and destruction of these trials. Will they deny that GM crops have major environmental benefits? Not only do they reduce production costs, they also cut back on the use of energy, pesticides and herbicides and reduce CO2 emissions. Though their opponents are still grasping at straws, it is clear from experience in America and elsewhere that the environment benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe we can perhaps afford the luxury of denying ourselves the food productivity benefits which GM crops offer, but do our Green colleagues not consider the interests of their fellow human beings in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia to whom GM crops will bring nutrition and health benefits and may even help them survive? Do they consider the effect that turning our backs on this advance will have on our scientific base and researchers, on our farmers and farm workers' jobs? On thousands of jobs in the food processing industry? On the price of food as well as the quality and the variety available to our consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, European consumers are entitled to be able to choose what food they buy and eat. We must protect our environment as best we can, but we also owe it to our constituents to be frank and honest about the risks and benefits. It is accepted that an organic label indicates 95% organic, i.e. up to 5% not organic. Why make the non-GMO label almost unobtainable by specifying unachievable levels of purity? I could well accept that premise, with the mischievous intention of making non-GMO so rare that no one could afford it. Then everyone will be forced to come to terms with the real world, where there will always be the possibility of some adventitious GM content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know from Eurobarometer opinion polls that most people are worried about GMOs. At the same time, they say that they do not know enough about them. Perhaps there is a connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Breyer that we have looked at those concerns very carefully to ensure that we establish clear legislation – a clear framework – for handling both the potential benefits and the risks of GMOs. That is why we have revised Directive 18/2001/EC to include better risk assessment and better information, so that consumers can make an informed choice. That is why we have proposed further legislation on traceability and labelling. However, it would not be honest to say that if we continue to import seeds, for example, we can guarantee total purity and no adventitious presence of GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that everything in nature escapes – through cross-pollination for example – so closing borders is not a viable solution. We have to be pragmatic and establish levels and thresholds to deal with natural phenomena. We have to look at the situation as it actually is and at the products we import.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to Mr Trakatellis' question about traceability. The proposals on traceability and labelling, as well as on food and feed, are not based entirely on the detectability of GMOs. Even if they cannot be detected, consumers have the right to know. The current Novel Foods Regulation will be replaced by these proposals and the scope will be broadened to give consumers a choice, even if the GMOs are not detectable. Consumers have the right to be informed of the presence of GMOs in the products they buy, even if the GMOs are not detectable.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment on two further issues that have been raised. Firstly, on labelling thresholds, the Commission can only take account of existing legislation and, for the time being, a 1% threshold is in force for foodstuffs. This 1% threshold is provided for by the Council regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000. Above that 1% threshold, an indication of the presence of a genetic modification in a food is compulsory. As the recital of the regulation states, the 1% value best serves the purpose of establishing a tolerance level which simultaneously remains low and takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain. All these factors along the production chain are involved. The seeds thresholds are based on this 1% threshold. You have to count backwards in order to reach this 1% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">A recital of the draft Commission directive on seeds provides that, should the food threshold change, the thresholds for seeds would need to be reconsidered accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the coexistence issue, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies is carrying out a study entitled 'Scenarios for Coexistence of Genetically Modified, Conventional and Organic Crops in European Agriculture', commissioned by the Agriculture Directorate-General and coordinated by the Joint Research Centre. The main aim of the study is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence. The study aimed to identify the source and estimated levels of adventitious presence of GM crops in non-GM crops at farm level, identify and assess changes in farming practices that could reduce adventitious presence below policy relevant thresholds and estimate the costs of relevant changes in farming practices, monitoring systems and potential insurance systems. The study confirms that cross-pollination and coexistence are issues that need to be considered in relation to agricultural production in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the study need to be interpreted with caution. Only three crops were analysed: oilseed rape for seed production, maize for feed use and potatoes for human consumption. The results are derived from models and have not been validated by real field data. Therefore this study provided preliminary conclusions but the hypothetical results need to be confirmed and further research will be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is discussing this and coordinating with the various directorate-generals. This debate will certainly continue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very complex and sensitive issue, legally, technically and politically. As I said earlier, we readily admit that we do not have all the answers. However, what we can do – as we have done with other technologies – is to put in place a legal framework to deal with the potential benefits as well as the risks. That is what we have tried to do with the revised Directive 18/2001/EC, traceability and labelling. Consequently it will, for example, affect thresholds when it comes to seed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for this debate and I am sure we shall continue it at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Credit is due to the Danish Presidency for having made every endeavour to maintain a united Union position. However, the General Affairs Council has assumed a very ambiguous position regarding the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements, following the offensive launched by the current US Administration in an attempt to obtain immunity for all US citizens across the board and the willingness to accept this demand displayed by a number of European countries, including Italy – something which particularly pains me – which, apart from being my native country, was also the first Member State to ratify the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to stress how shameful it is that the United States should have gone so far as to resort to threatening to impose sanctions on the countries which have ratified or intend to ratify the International Criminal Court Statute, and emphasise that there can be no agreements allowing those who have debased themselves by committing crimes against humanity or genocide to do so with impunity. Since the Rome Statute does not allow for derogations from this requirement, any agreement to that effect is to be deemed not to be compatible. That applies to the 15 Member States, but also to the countries which are going to join the Union and the countries with which the Union enjoys relations. The Council therefore needs to make every effort to hold a frank dialogue with the US Administration and to present to us a report stating a clear position on the compatibility of any potential bilateral agreements with the Rome Statute, before the Copenhagen European Council takes place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is supposed to give substance to the concept of international, immanent justice which can punish, if not prevent, genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Even with one International Criminal Court conducting an investigation into a few crooks who bear a large part of the responsibility for the massacres in the former Yugoslavia and another conducting an investigation into the genocide in Rwanda, however, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that all those guilty of offences which are just as serious will be prosecuted. How likely is it that the politicians and economic profiteers of the former colonial Belgian power, who consciously set the Tutsis and the Hutus against each other, will be prosecuted? Will the French leaders be prosecuted, those leaders whose troops in Rwanda were present, holding their fire at the massacres unleashed by the government in office, when they did not make matters worse by supplying weapons to either side?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the United Kingdom be prosecuted for its part in the political manœuvres which played such a major role in the ethnic massacres in Sierra Leone? How likely is it that George Bush, who is preparing, openly and publicly, to bombard tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians with the excuse that he is punishing their dictator, will be prosecuted before the Court for crimes against humanity? How likely is it that the industrial groups which, thanks to the gung-ho activities of politicians, are free to derive considerable profits from the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, will be prosecuted?</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, the only effect of the International Criminal Court will be to add a touch of hypocrisy to an imperialist world where the strongest have the last word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is unacceptable for the American Government to undermine the Court by trying to enter into bilateral agreements with EU countries or candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Danish Presidency has worked hard to maintain a common EU position, and I am sorry that no such position has come about. The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure, and I want, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the United States signed the statute, but has withdrawn its signature. I hope that the Council will embark upon a new dialogue with the American Government concerning the recognition of the International Criminal Court, which all the Member States and most of the candidate countries have now ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States share the same basic values. Both parties profess freedom and democracy and the defence of human rights and the principles of the rule of law. That is why the United States, which will be able to contribute in a particularly positive way to the Court and to the way it operates, should be among the signatories of the Rome Statute. Since 1998, the EU has tried to accommodate American anxieties in relation to certain provisions of the Statute, but its efforts have unfortunately been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate, moreover, that the United States does not now intend to be a party to the statute which, as I say, it in fact signed during the Clinton administration. The United States’ decision is wrong, and we must all regret the American measures. We must therefore hope that the United States can be convinced to adopt a more positive line once the Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be misused for political purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, this debate on the International Criminal Court has gone from one extreme to another. We heard one extreme earlier, in Mrs Cauquil's speech. Mrs Cauquil, I must say to you in all honesty that we do not want an international revolutionary tribunal. Putting forward theses such as yours is a sure-fire way of scuppering the whole idea of a criminal court. On the other hand – and here I do agree with you – we do not want a criminal court to be no more than a rubber stamp in the hands of the major powers. I am really sorry that the forces that, even if they are not willing or able to prevent this court completely, want to downgrade it to some sort of rubberstamp are gaining ground in the USA and China and Russia and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union are going the way of the law and I think that this forms part of a good and important tradition. The Council of Europe was founded as a human rights community here in Strasbourg over 50 years ago. The Human Rights Convention was adopted and the Court of Human Rights was created here in Strasbourg. For the last 50 years, the European Parliament has sat here in Strasbourg as the voice of the people, as the voice of the European rule of law and because we want to extend this rule of law to the whole continent, we quite deliberately set the idea of the Copenhagen criteria, democracy and the rule of the law, at the spearhead of the historic enlargement process, which is now approaching its culmination.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a consequence of our history, which has, unfortunately, seen its own share of genocide, expulsion, disenfranchisement, suppressed minorities and crimes against humanity. We have no right to play teacher to the rest of the world, as we sometimes do, unless we take our own rule of law seriously. That does not just mean respecting the rule of law internally, it also means being the strong partner for others throughout the world, when it comes to the worldwide rule of law. The criminal court, like our founding treaty, was born in Rome and the idea of Rome is somehow bound up with the concept of law. The Rome Statute underlying the criminal court should not be undermined, weakened or watered down. If we do not want the courts needed for genocide and recurrent crimes against humanity to be wrongly denigrated as victor's justice or one-off justice, then we need a permanent criminal court to which all are equally subject, large and small states alike, whatever the nationality of the perpetrator or criminal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to hold on to this Statute as it stands. We are severely critical of the Council of the European Union for skimping on clarity and dignity here, for repeatedly trying to get by with devious manoeuvres and for repeatedly giving in to the powers that be. If Europe wants to take itself seriously, it must fight for this criminal court and must say to the United States of America that they are indeed our most important ally, but that just such an ally has a duty within the free world to take the law seriously, however uncomfortable it may find it.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need more unilateralism in response to 11 September; we need to strengthen the rule of law throughout the world, which is why we are calling for fast, undiluted ratification of the Rome Statute.</p>

The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the Court, are obviously in line with the principles and objectives of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment is articulated, as Mr Titley just reminded us, in the common positions on the ICC adopted in June 2001 and revised in June 2002. It is reflected in the Action Plan on the ICC adopted in May of this year and the conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council as recently as 20 September. These decisions all give clear evidence of the European Union's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent with that is the fact that the European Union is actively committed to ensuring the widest possible signature, ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute. To that end, between 1995 and 2001, the Commission's European initiative for democracy and human rights financed nearly EUR 7 million in projects with this purpose in various parts of the world. An additional EUR 6 million is earmarked for projects in 2002/2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as continuing to encourage all states that have not already done so to sign, ratify and adopt implementing legislation for the Rome Statute as soon as possible, we also encourage all states to respond to Washington's request for immunity agreements in a manner which is consistent with the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council on 30 September provide guidance on the ways to ensure that such responses preserve the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which is absolutely fundamental and vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also wants all states which have ratified the Rome Statute to be actively involved in nominating and electing the chief prosecutor and judges of the International Court. This should be done in a manner consistent with the process and criteria established by the Rome Statute and the resolution of the first assembly of states parties.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in this debate on a resolution that has jointly been tabled by five groups. This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and, more rarely, men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventy-five people died in 2000, 139 in 2001 and so far this year 250. We note the letter of 23 October from the Iranian ambassador to the EU, assuring us that there have been no cases of stoning in recent months and that directives have been issued by the competent authorities for the cessation of this process and are being observed. Nevertheless, we are not entirely reassured while sentences of death by stoning continue to be passed and while the use of the death penalty more generally continues to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the EU generally protest against the use of the death penalty throughout the world, whether it be in the United States, China, Japan or anywhere else, and Iran is no exception. Nevertheless, we recognise that sections of Iranian society are trying to move on. Forces of progress who want to see a less cruel form of Islamic society exist and they are growing in numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution does not threaten talks between the EU and Iran regarding future trade and cooperation agreements, though it is clear that this will include a human rights clause. The European Parliament, which has to approve such agreements, will watch with close attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran. However, I simply cannot understand why negotiations on a cooperation and trade agreement between the European Union and Iran should begin on 29 October. Parliament has called on numerous occasions for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be suspended or frozen when human rights are being violated. So why are we applying this double standard?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decided on 22 October, just two days ago, not to table a human rights resolution on Iran at the next sitting of the UN Commission on Human Rights. I find that totally unacceptable. I cannot but wonder if the reason for not wanting to expose the Iranian Government now is that it does not square with the policy on Iraq? We in the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left support the joint motion, although it does represent a shift from the real resolution on human rights to a composite resolution on human rights plus cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but we think that parts of items 4 and 5 are wrong for the reasons I have mentioned and we have therefore applied for a split vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would be delighted if the hope reflected by this common motion were to be fulfilled, by which I mean if an end to human rights violations in Iran were to give us cause for optimism. However, present circumstances alone give me no cause whatsoever for any such belief, which is why we must raise our voices, at any rate here in Parliament.</p>

As far as I can see, this draft resolution seems to be remiss on one particular point from an editorial point of view. The four Iranian women condemned to death by stoning have not been fully named with first names and surnames – see the end of Paragraph 3. Of the four names mentioned, for example, two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names. I therefore propose a correction to the text for the sake of the case of these condemned women.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking metaphorically, the dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran on human rights is very much an uphill struggle. From the European perspective, we have to guard against being responsible for obstructing the way ourselves. Any hand extended by Iran is therefore welcome. We welcome particularly the valuable gesture made by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kharrazi, to an ad hoc delegation visit of this Parliament on 20 July, who wanted direct contact between representatives of the Iranian legal system and EU lawyers. I would like to see the Council and the Commission seize this offer as quickly as possible. After all, the Iranian sentences, which have been rightly challenged, can be dealt with by this motion for a resolution at a correct and conclusive level. The chance of this type of contact should also be seized upon in order to oppose the barbaric sharia punishment of stoning. For let there be no misunderstanding with regard to Europe’s position towards Iran. We cannot and will not live with a system which condones stoning fellow human beings, wherever this may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dialogue with Iran is important, but our main concern, as the European Parliament, is for a human rights dialogue. As parliamentary representatives, we are free from diplomatic constraints when it comes to demanding this universal principle, which is why we say loud and clear to any country concerned that we reject the death penalty in general.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rise in the number of death sentences carried out in Iran compared with previous years is concerned, I should like to state here how I evaluate the situation. Conservative forces within both formal and informal structures are obviously using death sentences carried out or corporal punishment inflicted to intimidate both the people and the liberal forces in parliament and other societal institutions. It has nothing to do with Islam or the Koran. Because internal pressure is increasing, so is repression.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must stick to the demonstrable facts in all our criticism and check every allegation, irrespective of its source. That is why I am against overloading the resolution with allegations which, in the final analysis, we cannot prove, thereby undermining our own credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">People have been sentenced to be stoned to death. We have proof that two of these sentences were carried out in the first half of 2001, but not for 25 September 2002. Let us therefore make use of Iran's readiness to discuss all human rights issues, including individual cases, without preliminary conditions, as expressed in talks with the EU-Iran Human Rights Exploratory Experts mission<span class="italic"> </span>at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">I still worry that the Council has drawn the short straw by officially refraining from tabling the annual human rights resolution on Iran at the United Nations. It is not the Presidency that deserves to be criticised here, but the usual suspects who feel their plans may be upset.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do say is that it is good that they want to talk; let us hold a comprehensive dialogue and, if we see improvements, only then should we refrain from tabling new resolutions in due course. There can be no upfront concessions at the expense of human rights. Given the situation, we should clearly remind the structures in question in Iran – and in my view the Council and Commission as well – of one thing. A negotiated agreement will only come about with Parliament's assent and the issues to which we shall be paying particular attention are those I have just addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Barbaric punishments are still being carried out. The backward and medieval practice of stoning still forms part of its criminal justice system. Individuals are publicly hanged, hands are chopped off for minor transgressions and eyes are even put out without anaesthetic. Women are predominantly the victims of this inhuman judicial procedure. If Iran is serious about opening itself up to the West, if it is serious about a dialogue with the European Union, then this violation of human rights has to stop. The extreme nature of the sharia represents an insurmountable obstacle for normal relations. There can be no question of a trade and cooperation agreement with Europe as long as the human rights situation is not resolved. The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union have to make this very clear right from the start. Does Commissioner Kinnock agree with me on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we cannot abandon a condemnation resolution in the UN if Iran continues with its evil infringement of universal principles. This is not a question of a successful human rights dialogue with the EU as was suggested, but of a successful abolition of barbaric methods. The European Union cannot afford to isolate Iran. It is very important for reformists to be supported in their battle for a democratic and more humane Iran. The younger generation wants change and offers hope. Unfortunately the Iranian authorities do not know how to handle the situation. But there is no substitute for openness and democratisation. Modernisation can only triumph if barbaric practices and an evil past are brought to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As long as Khatami’s adviser on women’s affairs considers stoning to be a measure which underpins the family, we can only consider this to be truly horrible.</p>
<p class="contents">Since our resolution of 13 December 2001, 250 people have been executed in Iran, and 75 the previous year. How can they speak about progress! It does not look as if the human rights situation is improving. I find that the motion for a resolution placed before us for our vote is not sufficiently clear. Despite the visit by a European delegation in connection with human rights, there were still five public executions on 30 September. We therefore condemn the European Council’s decision not to introduce a resolution about human rights in Iran before the next sitting of the UN Comission on Human Rights in Geneva. We want to state clearly and unambiguously that this resolution must be introduced before the next sitting. We want to say in all clarity that the European Parliament cannot assume that we can discuss cooperation agreements if there is no real improvement to the situation on human rights in Iran and that is why we have not signed.</p>

It is also a country with which the West has had troubled relations over a number of years. In rejecting Western consumerist values, Iran radicalised itself and supported radical Islamic groups in Lebanon, such as Hizbollah. There is added complexity because the conflicts with the West have long been bound up with internal disagreements within Iran itself. Recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere. The result has been a thaw in relations which we should welcome in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations will depend on fundamental progress in the areas of human rights and illegal immigration, weapons of mass destruction, in particular the country's nuclear weapons programme, drugs, the Middle East, Afghanistan and the battle against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to drug trafficking, the Iranians, who have a very serious drug problem of their own, should be commended for their efforts and cooperation. They have also resisted the temptation to destabilise Afghanistan and have indicated they will not attempt to foment instability in Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein's departure from the scene. Iran needs regional stability, and this has been recognised by the Iranian leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East, Iran has joined Saudi Arabia in accepting the principle of 'land for peace', if that is what the Palestinians want. All of these developments are important and very welcome. Iran needs to understand that Europe is extending the hand of friendship and that ways can be found to live together without Iran losing either its identity or its opposition to the worst of Western values. It would be wrong for the European Union to overstress the issue of capital punishment per se, which remains legal, if used appropriately, in international law. It is practised in the world's largest democracies such as the USA, Japan and India and is supported by tens of millions of citizens in my country, the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran's leaders, however, should be in no doubt about the universal horror felt by us about the barbaric and medieval Sharia punishment of stoning to death. I urge the Iranian leadership to reflect on this and to find solutions commensurate with Iran's dignity and history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The practice of stoning men and, in particular, women, not only continues to be provided for by law but is frequently applied, as is shown by the many death sentences already pronounced. As we are aware, in the coming months, a further four women will be stoned under a legislative framework which forces an oppressive, discriminatory system of control on women.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as respect for fundamental rights is concerned, the deterioration of the situation in Iran has been pointed out and emphasised by a number of organisations as well as a UN General Assembly resolution and the most recent report produced by the Special Representative of the UN Human Rights Commission on Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in the dialogue taking place between the European Union and Iran, the Union’s exploratory mission did indeed record willingness on the part of the Iranian Government to discuss human rights issues, including specific cases, but this verbal expression of good will has not been borne out by any practical measure. Quite the opposite: the situation seems to be deteriorating. Although it is true that we must welcome signs of cooperation from the Iranian Government, we also need to realise that the increase in executions and the continued stonings are a negative sign for the Union, which cannot accept them out of respect for its own Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions. It is therefore imperative that, at all stages of the current dialogue, the Union makes clear that it is an absolute necessity that Iran guarantees respect for fundamental rights, especially women’s rights, and that it reiterates the need for Iran to abolish the death penalty, the practice of stoning and all other inhuman or debasing practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that respect, Iran is one of the world’s worst offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest reports of women having been stoned to death according to ancient sharia laws are utterly hair-raising. The fact that this is happening in 2002 is completely unacceptable. A whole world turns in abhorrence upon Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the EU and Iran are characterised by a certain amount of caution, which is good. If these relations are to become meaningful, the issue of human rights must always be at the top of the agenda, however. I would also draw attention to the fact that Parliament has its veto when it comes to acknowledging possible agreements, and this is something we shall use if the situation does not improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, he is demonstrating good will in the light of the trade agreement with the EU. We do not need good will, however; we need results. I agree with all my fellow MEPs who have said that we cannot enter into any trade agreement with Iran. It would be completely schizophrenic, on the one hand, to say that we want to see a strongly critical resolution in the UN and, on the other hand, to enter into a trade agreement with the same country. Let us think for a moment. Of course we must embark upon the critical dialogue with Iran, and if this yields fruit in terms of our no longer seeing stonings or barbaric death penalties and sentences in Iran, then we can of course begin to pave the way for trade agreements.

<p class="contents">Both sides need to make an effort if we are to achieve this objective. On our side, we need to show we are willing to acknowledge the history of this vast country, as well as its present situation and the natural and socio-economic factors which shape it from both within and without.

<p class="contents">On Iran's side, its leaders must realise that the West, and the European Union in particular, will only open up to and work with the developing world if it respects human rights; these are not values Europe wishes to impose, they are ecumenical values and they include women's rights, which are particularly prone to abuse.</p>

Naturally, the Commission continues to be concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and, in particular, by the persistence of repressive measures against democratic institutions, civil society and the media.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevalence of arbitrary arrests, torture, discrimination against minorities and evident lack of the rule of law are all deeply disturbing. The all-too-plentiful evidence of the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, including the appalling stoning of children, of women and of men, continue to demonstrate the scarcity of civilised standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective way to raise these concerns is through the half-yearly comprehensive dialogue meetings, bilateral talks at ministerial level and similar sustained activities. In addition, avenues for more direct and specific dialogue have been explored recently by the troika, as several Members said.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 October the GAERC endorsed the strategy for starting a human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the recommendations of the exploratory troika mission that visited Teheran from 30 September to 1 October last. During these explanatory talks, the Iranian Government voiced a political will to enter into a human rights dialogue and to do so largely on the EU's terms. No restrictions were requested in relation to the list of human rights issues to be discussed and the dialogue will be regularly assessed with the help of specific and realistic benchmarks, such as reports from the visits of the United Nations thematics rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue would initially take the form of an experimental round table in Teheran in December of this year. Its format will be assessed immediately after the first session and could be revised, as necessary, in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of negotiations with Iran on a trade and cooperation agreement, indissolubly linked to instruments on political dialogue and counter-terrorism, gives the European Union substantial leverage, since the progress in the negotiations will be directly related to parallel progress in, among other things, human rights. This connection is at the heart of the political package defined at the June Council and formally adopted on 12 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a structured EU-Iran dialogue on human rights is obviously not a complete antidote to the variety of deep and serious concerns. At this juncture, however, it seems to constitute the most effective available means of promoting our attempts to bring about tangible improvements in the grievous human rights situation in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that, in all of this, our concerns relate to the basic rights and well-being of human beings, regardless of their faith, regardless of their customs. That is the fundamental value that guides us and provides the motivation of the European Union. We will continue to act upon those fundamentals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nepal’s fledgling democracy is shaky and the rule of law is constantly giving way to the arbitrary and to violence. Over 3000 people have died in less than a year – which is appalling – following the violent confrontations between the army and the Maoist guerrillas, whose aim is to overthrow the monarchy, apparently against the wish of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, this people has been subjected to a genuine civil war for over six years, and the reaction of the international community has been almost total indifference. The difficult situation has just been violently exacerbated by the events which took place at the beginning of this month. In announcing the dismissal of the Prime Minister and temporarily assuming the executive powers, something which has not happened since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1990, King Gyanendra has sparked off a major political crisis. Indeed, even though he subsequently appointed another Prime Minister, the new Prime Minister has no representative legitimacy and, indeed, the King must be sorely tempted to use the fight against Maoist guerrilla groups to suspend the rule of law and put an end to the period of parliamentary democracy which has prevailed for 12 years.</p>
<p class="contents">These events have destabilised Nepal and thus exacerbated the unrest and instability throughout the region as a whole. The European Union can no longer be content just to express good intentions faced with such a situation. We must urge the new Prime Minister in the strongest terms possible to resume unconditional dialogue with the Maoist rebels. Moreover, it would be desirable, in this respect, for the Council to appoint a special representative for Nepal without delay, who would, if necessary, be able to serve as mediator between the two sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly and most importantly, given that this conflict is largely the result of economic and social problems, we must set aside a substantial amount of financial aid in order to be able to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and democracy in this small kingdom when the time comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The destructive work of the Maoist guerrillas continues unabated. In many parts of Nepal there are no longer any schools or hospitals and the infrastructure will be in ruins for years to come. Every week we hear of more police officers and civilians murdered. The most recent low point was when the famous statue of King Gyanendra was blown up in the middle of Patan, an area that I know well. One passer-by was killed and nine others were injured.</p>
<p class="contents">The guerrillas – unlike the majority of the population who are unequivocal in their support – want an end to the constitutional monarchy. Over 5 000 people have fallen victim to the violence since 1996. It was only last May that the European Parliament conferred with Prime Minister Deuba in Brussels. Now the King has sacked him because, contrary to what he said in public, he was in favour of postponing the November elections for a year. Bahadur Khadka, whom the King appointed as his successor , and who has already been prime minister twice before, is now heading the transitional government and has announced that he intends to secure peace and stability in the country and start negotiating with the rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the PPE-DE is perfectly clear. Nepal needs the rule of law, pluralism and continuing parliamentary democracy. The fight against corruption and nepotism must be stepped up and the postponed elections must be accompanied by effective security measures, so that they can be held as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Union, across the party political divide, to offer its services as mediator. The Council should appoint a special representative for Nepal. I hope the Commission shares this position. I have acted as vice-chairman of the SAARC delegation for many years and know from my regular contacts with and in Nepal that Europeans are held in high regard. We could start acting as honest brokers right now and make an important contribution to the peace that the Nepalese people have long deserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current ruler is concentrating all power in his own hands. The state of emergency has been replaced by a permanent state of absolute power with no real hope of improvement. The rebel movement grows daily because the sense of hopelessness is steadily increasing in the countryside and young people join the rebels. They are fighting a corrupt regime which owns 95% of the country’s wealth. And some of our Member States, including my own, Belgium, are sending weapons to this country.</p>
<p class="contents">In its earlier resolutions, the European Parliament has rightly urged that Europe should make the effort not just to support democracy but also to ensure that a political solution and negotiations can be achieved, but not that more powerful weapons should be delivered allowing even greater repression. This contravenes the European code of conduct itself. In the last six years alone five thousand people died in Nepal. Yesterday, another 25 were killed in various clashes. I do not care which side the victims come from, what concerns me is that we must strive for a peaceful solution, that the only hope we can give this country is developing its land and providing opportunities for its people.

This resolution rightly condemns all acts of violence, those perpetrated by the security forces, but also those by the Maoist rebels. It rightly presses for mediation and political consultation. However, it rightly asks for the underlying causes of the conflict to be addressed, that is, abject poverty, social inequality and marginalised population groups. In August, the European Commission provided EUR 615 000 for a peaceful solution to the conflict. Against this background, it is unwise to supply murder weapons to Nepal. It is also a clear violation of the code of conduct regarding the export of weapons. The Flemish Greens clearly state that the conditions for supply are not fulfilled and our party will continue to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Belgian Parliament whether it is still possible to suspend the planned supply of weapons. In this sense, this resolution is a more than obvious sign to Mr Michel of a poor, incoherent document. The Nepalese need ploughshares, not weapons, Mr Michel.</p>

It is particularly concerned by human rights violations both by the insurgents and by counter-insurgency forces in and around the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Observers believe that there cannot be a durable military solution to the crisis and that it is extremely urgent to end a period of political instability caused by endemic rivalries among the different leaders of various political parties. The Commission hopes that the designation by the king of the new Prime Minister, Mr Chand, as head of an interim caretaker government, will give the necessary impetus to rebuild the national consensus, including efforts to improve governance, allow free and fair elections as soon as possible and re-open the dialogue with the Maoist insurgents.</p>
<p class="contents">Ongoing consultations with political parties should help to complete the formation of the new government From it, we expect tangible initiatives to foster multi-party dialogue and the implementation of urgent measures to fight the underlying socio-economic causes of conflict to which Mr Staes and other Members have rightly referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of its cooperation activities, the Commission is ready to provide support to long-term development initiatives, especially for poverty alleviation in critical areas of the mid-western part of Nepal and to provide support to local institutions seeking to strengthen the rule of law and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission calls on the authorities to create the conditions for holding peaceful and democratic elections and to announce new dates for local and parliamentary elections soon. Meanwhile, the Commission confirms that the funding foreseen for the planned EU election observer mission will remain committed until December 2003. At this juncture, these are all the feasible and practical undertakings we can give to try and resolve an appalling and long-lasting bloody situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(DA) Since the collapse of the Taliban regime and the establishment of new political institutions in Afghanistan, preparations have been under way, both in the Member States concerned and at EU level, for the repatriation of Afghans illegally resident in EU Member States. Some Member States have already adopted programmes such as this; where appropriate, in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>As regards EU action in this field, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the conclusions from the Seville European Council urged the Council to adopt a repatriation programme based on the Commission Green Paper on repatriation by the end of the year. This programme shall also aim to provide ‘the best possible facilities for early return to Afghanistan’, as stated in point No 30 of the conclusions.</p>
<p>In order to implement the conclusions from Seville, the Danish Presidency has presented a draft plan specifically dealing with repatriation to Afghanistan. This draft was discussed at the meeting of the Council of ministers with responsibility for asylum and immigration last week, where it met with widespread approval. The Presidency anticipates that the plan will be adopted at the next Council meeting involving this group, which is on 28 and 29 November. Subsequently, it is anticipated that the plan can be implemented as swiftly as possible in 2003.</p>
<p>The plan envisages voluntary repatriation as its preferred model, but also presupposes that, after a reasonable period of time, expulsion can be resorted to if the persons concerned will not return of their own volition.</p>
<p>The Presidency is of course familiar with the Amnesty International report from July of this year to which the questioner refers, and its recommendations. We also agree wholeheartedly with Amnesty that returning to Afghanistan at the present time is not without problems. This is one of the reasons why the plan also contains provisions on counselling of returnees. Furthermore, the plan envisages the establishment of a coordination group under the auspices of the Commission, one of whose tasks will be to ensure the smooth implementation of the plan, taking into account such factors as reception conditions and capability in Afghanistan. Lastly, the plan also envisages the involvement of relevant organisations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, and of course the Afghan authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council is currently discussing two Commission proposals that are relevant to Sweden’s salmonella guarantees.</p>
<p>The first proposal is for a Regulation on the control of salmonella and other zoonoses. Its aim is to reduce the prevalence of salmonella within the Community, particularly in primary production. It would not result in any reduction of the guarantees that Finland and Sweden currently enjoy with respect to live animals. The provision of the Commission’s proposal concerning salmonella guarantees has not given rise to controversy during the discussions within the Council.</p>
<p>The second proposal concerns the hygiene of food of animal origin. The Commission’s proposal would have preserved Finland and Sweden’s current salmonella guarantees, but would have permitted their modification through comitology. The European Parliament has endorsed the maintenance of the status quo for Finland and Sweden, but proposed that it not be possible to modify the guarantees other than through the co-decision procedure. The Council has yet to conclude its discussions on this point.</p>
<p>On the occasion of its meeting on October 15, the Council held a policy debate on food safety and zoonoses and it agreed to instruct its preparatory instances to pursue the in-depth examination of the dossier in order to report back to the Council at its forthcoming session with a view to reaching a possible political agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0671"></a>

<p>(DA) Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty stipulates that it is up to the European Parliament to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting unanimously.</p>
<p>As the result of the Irish referendum on 19 October 2002 was positive, the Treaty of Nice will enter into force very soon. In accordance with this Treaty, the Council shall take decisions regarding approval on the basis of a qualified majority vote instead of unanimously, except where provisions in connection with the tax scheme are concerned.</p>
<p>It is true that the European Parliament adopted a draft Statute on 3 December 1998; that is to say, before the Treaty of Amsterdam – which established the required legal basis – entered into force on 1 May 1999. It is also true that Parliament formalised the draft on 5 May 1999 and subsequently confirmed this with a vote on 27 October 1999, following the elections in the same year. Since then, however, new ideas have come to the fore in Parliament, which have been discussed, in particular, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the basis of, among other things, the conclusions reached by the High Level Group.</p>
<p>The Council would draw attention to the fact that a dialogue has been taking place the whole time between the various Presidencies and the representatives nominated by Parliament, in contact groups, for example.</p>
<p>For its part, the Council, on 4 December 2000, stated its position on some of the main elements of the Statute that Parliament had proposed, by endorsing a letter from the President of the Council, Mr Moscovici, to Mrs Fontaine.</p>
<p>With regard to the tax scheme, the Council reached unanimity on 29 October 2001.</p>
<p>Lastly, the President of the Council, Mr Piqué, sent a letter to Mr Cox on 8 May of this year, reminding him that the Council is prepared to work closely with Parliament to bring about a compromise which is acceptable to both institutions and which can be adopted well in advance of the next European Parliament elections, in 2004.</p>
<p>The Council is of the opinion that a common statute will undoubtedly contribute to conferring greater dignity on the office of Member of the European Parliament by generating greater openness in the general conditions for the exercise of this office.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0676"></a>

<p>(EN) The oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0676_EN.html">H-0676/02</a> of the Honourable Member of the European Parliament, Prof. Antonios Trakatellis, regards two aspects: Firstly the Council's position on detectability of genetically modified DNA or protein, and secondly consumer protection in cases where products produced from GMOs are analytically identical to conventional products.</p>
<p>Detectability as such is a phenomenon that depends on scientific facts and the availability of technical solutions. It is therefore up to the Commission and not to the Council to scrutinise and assess detectability and to suggest appropriate solutions.<br />With regard to genetically modified DNA or protein in products produced from genetically modified organisms, it is a well known fact that there are cases where products produced from GMOs cannot be analytically distinguished from conventional products.</p>
<p>In cases where analytical methods cannot be used to distinguish conventional products from GMO-derived products, the Council is determined to ensure a high degree of consumer protection by providing for the necessary rules in the relevant legislation. The Council and the European Parliament currently discuss a regulation concerning traceability and labelling of products consisting of or containing GMOs and traceability of food and feed products produced from GMOs and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (2001/0180/COD)). This proposal contains, as you will well be aware of, the following elements:</p>
<p>Systems and procedures to identify to whom and from whom products are made available, at all stages of placing on the market;</p>
<p>The transmission by operators of information concerning the identity of a product, i.e. that the product "is produced from GMO's" in case of GMO-derived products;</p>
<p>The retention by operators of specified information for a period of at least five years, to be made available to competent authorities upon request.</p>
<p>This envisaged so-called paper trail system has proven to be practicable and safe in similar situations, e.g. for the documentation of products from organic farming. Likewise, it is an essential advantage of the chosen procedure that consumers are offered, by the appropriate labelling as foreseen in the parallel proposal for a regulation on genetically modified food and feed, a choice regarding the production method they wish to support by their purchase.</p>
<p>In parallel to the proposal on traceability and labelling of GMOs, the Council currently discusses a proposal for a regulation on genetically modified food and feed, equally covering derived products ("produced from GMOs").</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) At the European Council in Seville it was decided to reduce the number of Council formations. And it was decided to integrate all matters related to the Union's external actions through the creation of a new General Affairs and External Relations Council covering inter alia the development cooperation policy. This conclusion was reflected by the relevant amendments to the Council's Rules of Procedure on 22 July 2002. The aim of the reform of the Council is to improve the functioning of the Council in the run-up to enlargement and to enhance the coherence between the components of the Union's external policies.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to the full implementation of these new rules. In order to accomplish the above mentioned objectives of efficiency and coherence, while at the same time avoiding the risk of breaking up policy domains such as development cooperation, the Danish Presidency is proposing carefully balanced agendas for the meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
<p>Following the recent international conferences and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in particular, development-related issues are at the forefront of the EU agenda. The Danish Presidency emphasised the importance it attaches to development issues when it included a public and broadcasted debate on the key issue of Trade and Development on the agenda of the meeting of the new General Affairs and External Relations Council on 30 September 2002.</p>
<p>For reasons of consistency and in order to facilitate the participation of the Ministers for development cooperation, the Danish Presidency is aiming to deal with a number of development related items in one session at the Council meeting on 18-19 November 2002. The development issues will inter alia include Trade and Development, Reform and Efficiency of the Community’s Development Policy and Follow-up on international conferences.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the participation of the Ministers for development cooperation, the Presidency will try -insofar as possible- to place the development-related issues together on the agenda of one of the days of the Council meeting. This is done without prejudicing the organisational proceedings to be decided upon by the future Presidencies.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the Seville conclusions do not contradict the rule established by the Treaty (article 203) which stipulates that Member States are competent to define the person who will represent them within the Council, being assumed that this person should be entitled to engage the Member State Government.</p>
<p>Discussions on the practical implementation and the long-term implications of the Conclusions from the European Council in Seville are still ongoing. The Council is ready to review and if necessary adjust the organisation of the proceedings of the Council on a continuous basis in order to ensure that all aspects of EU’s external relations incl. development cooperation is dealt with in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the Council confirms that development remains a priority for the Council's agenda and that the organisational proceedings decided by the European Council do not detract from its importance. On the contrary, they are intended to enhance the development dimension of EU related policies and to meet the overarching objective of promoting comprehensive EU external action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0684"></a>

<p>Helping developing countries to meet EU requirements, such as for organic food and sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, is part of the measures the Commission has put forward in its proposed action plan set out in its Communication on trade and development as compliance with such standards has emerged as one of the major constraints on the increase of exports by developing countries to industrialised markets. The Council is currently examining this Communication and will take a position on trade and development in the conclusions it plans to adopt on this subject at its session on 18-19 November.</p>
<p>The Council would reiterate that the inspection certificate mentioned by the honourable Member is part of the legislative provisions introduced by the Commission in accordance with Council Regulation No 2092/91 on organic farming. Its aim is to safeguard the equivalence of production standards for organic products available to the European consumer, regardless of their origin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0687"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU and Russia have repeatedly stressed their commitment to develop their strategic partnership on the basis of shared values. Democratic principles and human rights, including freedom of religion, are key elements in this respect. They are regularly discussed at all level of our intensive political dialogue at all levels. In this context, the implementation of Russia’s international commitments is also discussed.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the problems several religious groups in Russia have been facing over the past months. The EU has expressed its concern in a démarche carried out with the Russian authorities earlier this year. The EU continues to closely follow notably the situation of foreign representatives of the Catholic Church after some of them had problems at the border. The EU is staying in close contact with the Nuncio (Representative of Vatican) in Moscow in this respect.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to raise this type of issue in the framework of the political dialogue with Russia. Moreover, the Council is currently discussing how its dialogue with Russia on human rights questions can be made more efficient and result-oriented. This naturally also concerns the issue of religious freedom in Russia. To this end, on 21 October 2002, the Council took stock of preparations for the EU-Russia Summit to be held in Copenhagen on 11 November 2002. In this context, the Council agreed to address the state of the political dialogue as well as the need to ensure the possibilities of discussing all issues of interest among which human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0695"></a>

<p>(EN) In its resolution of 21 May 2002 on the future of European tourism<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council invites the Commission, the Member States and the other stakeholders in the tourism sector 'to make best possible use of the information and communication technologies for the implementation' of the initiatives referred to in the resolution.</p>
<p>This invitation is a direct continuation of several other texts, viz. :</p>
<p>-	firstly, the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Lisbon on 23-24 March 2000. The summit set the European Union the goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion;</p>
<p>-	secondly, the European Charter for Small Enterprises, the adoption of which in the Council on 13 June 2000 was welcomed by the European Council meeting in Santa Maria da Feira on 19-20 June 2000. Even though this Charter is primarily horizontal in nature as it is designed in general to take account of the special needs of small businesses, it naturally also applies to the tourism sector as such;</p>
<p>-	and thirdly, the Council's decision of 20 December 2000 on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005)<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The aim of this programme is to foster measures which 'develop the use of new information and communications technologies' and 'encourage innovative practices'.</p>
<p>The Council is therefore in agreement with the Honourable Member that the development of e-tourism cannot be seen as anything other than positive and fully in keeping with the invitation to the European tourist industry and the other stakeholders in the tourism sector contained in the above mentioned resolution of 21 May 2002 ' to participate actively in and support the efforts undertaken by the European Community and the Member States to improve the accessibility, the competitiveness and the quality of European tourism'.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would also point out that any fresh initiative at Community level in this area first requires the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In relation to upholding human rights, there are many areas which are of great concern to the EU, and which will continue to be so in 2003. Amongst these are the following:</p>
<p>Securing the abolition of the death penalty: In countries that retain the death penalty, the EU aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and urges respect for the minimum standards set out in international human rights instruments and other documents, notably the “EU Guidelines towards third countries on the death penalty”, adopted by the European Council in June 1998.</p>
<p>As regards action for 2003, the EU is conscious that initiatives to raise the issue of death penalty in its political and economic dialogue with third countries should be intensified and that attention should be focused on the reasons put forward by countries for maintaining capital punishment, including those relating to ethnicity and religion.</p>
<p>Equally, the eradication of torture wherever it occurs is a priority concern of the European Union. The "EU Guidelines on Torture" adopted on April 9th 2001 offer a basis for EU intervention either in bilateral contacts with third countries (political dialogue, demarches and actions on individual cases), or in multilateral fora on human rights. They also underline the EU's support for relevant international and regional mechanisms. The EU intends to make use of all the tools at its disposal in furtherance of these guidelines in 2003.</p>
<p>Inclusion of human rights issues in dialogues with third countries: The EU seeks to ensure that the issue of human rights, democracy and the rule of law will be included in meetings and discussions with third countries and at all levels.</p>
<p>Human rights and terrorism: This issue will no doubt continue to be high on the agenda in 2003. The EU has already stated (at the Extraordinary European Council, held on the 21 September 2001) that in stepping up its actions against terrorism, it will ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and pointed out (at the Laeken, Barcelona and Seville European Councils) that respect for human rights and the rule of law is a central aspect for all effective strategies to eradicate terrorism. In combating terrorism States must adhere to international human rights norms and to their obligations under international human rights and refugee law.</p>
<p>Fighting poverty in the developing countries is one of the main targets of the EC development cooperation policy, which should be complementary to the policies pursued by the Member States. In this context, it should be recalled that the EC is the world's largest contributor in the field of development cooperation and that it plays a major role in eradicating poverty through the commitments and objectives set in the context of the United Nations and other international organisations.</p>
<p>In its conclusions on the assessment, priorities and follow-up of the WSSD of 30 September 2002, the Council reiterated the commitment of the EU to ensure coherence between its internal and external policies, including its development assistance programmes, in order to achieve the goal of eradicating poverty and agreed to promote food security and rural development in the spirit of the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later in Rome.</p>
<p>In practical terms, all initiatives in the field of development cooperation, and especially those that constitute the follow-up to the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg International Conferences, should have a positive impact on the reduction of poverty in global terms.</p>
<p>The Council is currently working on a series of items that might require a conclusion and/or a follow-up under the forthcoming Greek and Italian Presidencies. These are:</p>
<p>Trade and development,</p>
<p>Regulations on poverty diseases and reproductive health,</p>
<p>Regulation on aid to Asia and Latin America,</p>
<p>Fighting rural poverty</p>
<p>Among the future items on the agenda of 2003 that might be tackled by the Greek and Italian Presidencies -provided that the Commission delivers on time the relevant proposals or communications-, the following should have a positive impact on reducing poverty:</p>
<p>EC support to develop the business sector in developing countries,</p>
<p>Forest development cooperation,</p>
<p>Privatisation of state-owned companies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0699"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council would draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that it was the Commission, in cooperation with the Netherlands' Ministry of Finance, which organised the seminar to which he refers, in the spring of 2001 in Noordwijk. It is therefore for those organisers to arrange for the publication and follow-up of the results of the seminar. The Commission has apparently recently published the outcome of the talks as well as a guide entitled 'Helping businesses overcome financial difficulties'. The Council would ask the Honourable Member to contact the Commission directly for further information in this regard.</p>
<p>With regard to the subject as such, the Council would recall that it adopted the European Charter on Small Enterprises at the meeting of 13 June 2000 and that this was welcomed by the European Council meeting in Santa Maria da Feira on 19-20 June 2000. The Charter is also reproduced as Annex III to the Presidency conclusions. On that occasion, the European Council stressed the great importance of small and medium-sized businesses for growth, competitiveness and employment in the EU and requested full implementation of the Charter as part of the comprehensive framework for enterprise policy. In the principles of the Charter, it is stated that some failure is concomitant with responsible initiative and risk-taking and must be mainly envisaged as a learning opportunity. The Charter also contains some 'lines for action' which although laying emphasis on the training of entrepreneurs and relevant qualifications, also stress the need for an assessment of Member States' bankruptcy laws in the light of good practice so that learning from benchmarking exercises can lead to the improvement of current practices in the EU.</p>
<p>This approach was confirmed at the European Council meeting in Barcelona on 15-16 March 2002. The aim was to create a more favourable climate for entrepreneurship and competitiveness by using the regulatory framework to encourage entrepreneurial activity. As regards social and labour market policy, the European Council also urged both sides of industry to find ways of managing corporate restructuring better through dialogue and a preventive approach.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission and an ad hoc group of experts consisting of Member States' representatives is currently undertaking a benchmarking comparison between the Member States' bankruptcy laws and the stigma associated with failure, which is part of a BEST project entitled 'Restructuring of bankruptcy and a fresh start'. The final report is expected to be available during the first half of 2003. Bankruptcy and attitude to risk and failure are also expected to be taken up by the Commission in its forthcoming green paper on entrepreneurship.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0703"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has relentlessly expressed its deep concerns at the human rights situation in China, including the serious abuses mentioned by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Council has most recently considered the human rights situation of China at its meeting on 11 and 12 March 2002. On that occasion, it adopted conclusions, which, while welcoming some positive developments, remained concerned about the lack of respect for human rights in China, including, amongst other, the widespread use of torture. It likewise expressed its deepest concern for the "Strike Hard" campaign, which had resulted in an extremely high number of death sentences and executions, and constituted a grave setback.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Council conclusions, on 2 April 2002, at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU urged China to take a number of steps to improve the situation on the ground, including limitations on the use of the death penalty, with a view to its abolition, putting an end to the "Strike Hard" campaign and reforming the system of administrative detention.</p>
<p>The Council has also received information regarding possibly broadening by China of the scope of the "Strike Hard" campaign as a preventive measure in the run-up to the 16th Party Congress, which is due to start on 8 November 2002.</p>
<p>The EU will meet with China on 13 and 14 November 2002 in the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, and intends, amongst other things, to reiterate its serious concerns over the "Strike Hard" campaign. It also intends to inquire about Chinese intentions with regard to the extensive use of the death penalty, as well as about Chinese efforts to curb use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatments or punishments, including psychiatric detention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0709"></a>

<p>At present, people aged 60 or older constitute 20% of the population of Europe. By 2050, it is anticipated that this proportion will double. This rapid growth shows that ageing will be one of the major challenges to be faced. The impact of this phenomenon on the economic and social development of the EU calls for coordinated action at European level with regard to various aspects (pensions, mobility, culture, education, inclusion, etc.) in order to ensure consistent and sustainable management, distinguishing those people who are merely elderly, who are still active and wholly or partially self-sufficient, from those defined as ‘old elderly’, who are not self-sufficient and require total assistance to maintain human dignity.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council is well aware of the major problems and challenges posed by the rapid ageing of the European population, and entirely shares the concerns raised by the Honourable Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Until now, the Council has not regarded it as necessary that Community competence in this area should be increased, conscious also of the fact that the question of competences is being considered in a comprehensive manner by the European Convention. Nevertheless, the ageing of the population has from the outset been a major consideration in the activities undertaken with a view to the improvement and modernisation of social protection in the framework of the open method of coordination, as initiated by the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
<p>The question of the sustainability and viability of the pension systems has been a particular priority area. The Council and the Commission submitted a joint report on objectives and working methods in this area to the Laeken European Council in December 2001. A second joint report assessing national pensions strategies and identifying good practices is being prepared for the 2003 Spring European Council.</p>
<p>These activities are mainly prepared and coordinated by the Social Protection Committee. In addition, the Economic Policy Committee has set up a separate Working Group on Ageing.</p>
<p>The Council also notes that the Member States participated actively and in a coordinated manner in the Second World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid on 8 - 12 April 2002, organised by the United Nations. Likewise, they will take part in the regional follow-up activities on the European level organised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, thus covering the whole European region. This process has already started with the holding of the UNECE Ministerial Conference on Ageing in Berlin on 11 - 13 September 2002, which adopted a Regional Implementation Strategy, and a Ministerial Declaration "A Society for all Ages in the UNECE Region". In its official statement on this occasion on behalf of the European Union, the Presidency underlined inter alia the importance of mainstreaming ageing in all policy fields, and of participation and non-discrimination as well as the health and well-being of the elderly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0711"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council of Ministers of economic and financial affairs is aware of the statistics referred to in the question. The Council has adopted a long term strategy in Lisbon in 2000 to achieve, among others, full employment and to increase the rate of employment. Employment is probably the main factor for improving social integration and poverty reduction. In view of this long term strategy the ECOFIN Council examined in Luxemburg, earlier this month, a report on the European Employment Strategy. The Council endorsed the priorities identified in the report such as the need to improve the functioning of the labour market, job creation and the quality of jobs. The ECOFIN Council did not propose a reduction of wages and salaries. Moreover, the Council has no competence for setting wages.</p>
<p>In fact, the Council is devoting considerable effort to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, bearing in mind the absence of any explicit Community competence. The activities are already being pursued in the framework of the open method of coordination, and the preparatory work mainly takes place within the Social Protection Committee. In December 2001, a first joint Council and Commission Report on Social Inclusion, based on the National Action Plans of the Member States, was submitted to the Laeken European Council.

<p>(EN) The EU remains very concerned about the lack of progress in the human rights situation in Iran. In particular, the EU's longstanding and firm position against the use of the death penalty and particularly cruel forms of execution such as stoning is well known to the Iranian Government.</p>
<p>An EU exploratory experts' mission in Troika format visited Teheran on 30 September and 1 October 2002 for talks on the possibility of establishing a formal human rights dialogue with Iran. The aim of such a dialogue would be to voice concerns, obtain information, and help bring about concrete improvements in the human rights situation in the country. In the margins of meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the EU expert delegation raised the question of executions in Teheran with the head of the Iranian delegation, who confirmed that a number of executions had taken place and that they had been public. The EU delegation took that opportunity to reiterate to the Iranian MFA the European Union's condemnation of the death penalty in general, and of public executions in particular.</p>
<p>The fact that the EU lost the vote on its draft resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in spring this year did have the effect that the mandate of the UN Special Representative for that country came to an end. However, it should be noted that the Iranian Government had in any event never extended an invitation to the UN Special Representative to visit (this was one of the matters on which the EU had intended to express concern through its draft resolution).</p>
<p>As regards the "absence of any EU resolution" at the Third Committee of the 57<span class="sup">th</span> UN General Assembly, where the discussion on human rights issues will not get fully underway until November, that statement is in fact premature. The EU is still in the process of deciding whether or not to table a resolution on the human rights situation in Iran in the Third Committee. A draft resolution has already been prepared and was discussed at a joint meeting on 9 October 2002 of the Working Groups on Human Rights and on the Middle East/Gulf region.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2002, the Council reaffirmed its position of principle whereby the establishment of a dialogue is without prejudice to the tabling of a resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. It agreed that at the 57th UN General Assembly, the EU will convey its deep concern at the serious violations of human rights in Iran and the lack of progress in a number of areas.</p>
<p>As regards trying to prevent, in so far as possible, the imposition and carrying out of death sentences in Iran, it should be remembered that a resolution in a UN forum is only one of the tools available to the EU in its endeavour to bring about an improvement in the human rights situation in any given country. Another tool is that of a démarche directly to the government concerned. The EU has already carried out a number of démarches to the Iranian government this year. Furthermore, human rights issues are discussed twice a year during the so-called Comprehensive Political Dialogue between the EU and Iran among a number of other political issues. Yet another possibility is that of a human rights dialogue established in accordance with the EU's guidelines.</p>
<p>As already mentioned on a previous answer, I can inform the Honourable Parliamentarian that the EU discussed an initiative to establish a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines on human rights dialogues with third countries, which were approved by the Council in December last. Exploratory meetings between European and Iranian human rights experts took place in Teheran at the beginning of this month. May I also add that human rights is one among 4 issues of concern on which the Council said it wanted to see progress, as the EU and Iran develop closer commercial links. On 21 October 2002 the Council stressed the importance it attaches to the opportunity presented by a human rights dialogue to bring about concrete improvements in the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran. It therefore agreed to enter into such a dialogue on the basis of the modalities, timing, interlocutors, subjects and benchmarks discussed during the EU exploratory mission to Iran. It also agreed that the first meeting under the dialogue would take place in Teheran before the end of 2002.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of public concern in Greece over recent price rises. Recently, Greek consumer organisations organised a "consumption strike" to voice their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>While it must remain the responsibility of the Greek authorities to monitor the development of the market in Greece, especially with regard to ensuring competition, the Community does have a role to play in the supply of public services.</p>
<p>In relation to these ‘services of general interest’, it is Community policy to promote high quality services to which European citizens and consumers can have access at an affordable price. The three aspects of quality, access and affordability define the concept of Universal service for which legal provisions exist in telecommunications, in postal services and are proposed for electricity. The Member States are responsible for monitoring the implementation of these universal service provisions.</p>
<p>Last December, the Commission published a first horizontal assessment of the market performance of network industries supplying services of general interest. The report showed that telecommunications and electricity supply were more affordable in Greece, at least in 2001, compared to 1996, for low-income consumers as well as for average income consumers.</p>
<p>In relation to the transposition by Greece of Directive 98/27 on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests and Directive 1999/44 on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, the Commission can confirm that it has begun the infringement proceedings. In relation to the Injunctions Directive proceedings have begun before the Court of Justice.

<p>(FR) The Commission was fully aware at the time of the initiative of the United States’ authorities (and not of European port authorities, as the honourable Member suggests) to send American customs officers to certain Union ports.</p>
<p>This American initiative is part of a more global approach to the security of maritime transport on a world level, which only concerns the Member States mentioned. To this end, it favours the use of customs procedures applicable to exports in order that they may be subject to appropriate controls. The Community’s response must therefore satisfy two essential criteria: it must be global so that it can be integrated into a worldwide approach and it must satisfy the requirements of our internal market in particular by guaranteeing equal treatment for all our exporters.</p>
<p>The selection of only certain ports also runs counter to the Union’s objective of better geographical distribution of transport flows in order to relieve a transport network which is already saturated. The Commission still believes that such an uncoordinated approach and failing to organise a global approach to the problem is not the best response to the issue of security.</p>
<p>While proposing close coordination with the United States authorities in question in order ultimately to reach mutual recognition agreements for the implementation of genuine security rules, in a few months the Commission will present a proposal on the implementation and control of all the appropriate security measures in all the Union’s international commercial ports, based on the approved rules of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).</p>
<p>Recent talks between the Commission and the American authorities have been encouraging and we therefore hope that, in the medium term, we will be able to give better guarantees of security on both sides of the Atlantic.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0607"></a>

<p>(EN) In accordance with Council Resolution on “Fisheries and Poverty reduction”, the Commission considers that Community Fisheries Agreements have potential economic benefits for developing countries and can contribute to development objectives when they are based on the following elements:</p>
<p>The Fisheries Agreement targets a surplus resource that the coastal State does not have the capacity to harvest;</p>
<p>The agreement is consistent with the fisheries development strategy formulated and implemented by the partner country, and financial compensation is paid and used in accordance with sound budgetary management practice;</p>
<p>The agreement is based on well founded scientific knowledge of the country’s fishery resources;</p>
<p>The precautionary principle is applied in order to avoid over-exploitation of endangered living resources and</p>
<p>the situation of small-scale fisheries is taken into account through the strict observance of a protection zone.</p>
<p>The Commission is working to improve the coherence between the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy and Development objectives. As part of this effort an evaluation on the coherence between Fisheries Agreements and development co-operation as laid down in Country Strategy papers has been launched.</p>
<p>At the request of the developing countries themselves fisheries has been included as part of European development co-operation policy. The fisheries sector has been selected as a priority in the Regional Indicative Programme for the "Pacific Region" and for the "Region of Eastern and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean". The West Africa Regional Programme takes also into account fisheries within the first area of concentration devoted to economic integration (assistance for the formulation and implementation of regional fisheries policies) and within the “non-concentration area” (possibility to finance systems for surveillance and control of fishing activities). The Central Africa Regional Programme reserves financial means in order to assess possible interventions in the fisheries sector. It must be noted that National Indicative Programmes contain other priorities which can support the fisheries sector; priority for infrastructure allows interventions for harbours equipment, priority for good governance allows interventions aiming at strengthening developing countries capacities to better define and implement fisheries sector policies. Last but not least the European Development Policy is involved in an important "all-African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) Fish Sanitary control programme”; The overall objective of this intervention is the optimal use of ACP states' fishery resources. The specific purpose of this programme is to improve the access of ACP fisheries products to the world market, by strengthening the capacity for sustainable export health controls and improving production conditions.</p>
<p>These interventions must contribute to an equitable distribution of the added value created by a sustainable use of fishery resources. They show that fisheries can have an important role in term of poverty reduction which is the main objective of our European Development Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0609"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member refers to the increased seizures made under the Community customs regulations, and in particular Council Regulation (EC) No. 3295/94, these figures reflect both increased production capacity but also substantially improved enforcement by customs. This increase results from better targeted customs controls, based on information exchanged between Member States and better co-operation with rightholders. Operational seminars, funded under the Community Customs 2002 programme, have played an important role in bringing customs experts from the Community and candidate countries together with rightholders. Such seminars have resulted in improved working methods with specific emphasis being placed on products dangerous to the consumer.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue with these practical actions to help enforcement agencies increase their expertise in this sensitive area. To help combat the problem of counterfeiting and piracy at the Community level, the Commission is also examining the possibility of making a proposal for a directive which would harmonise Member States’ legislation on the means of enforcing intellectual and industrial property rights and establishing a general framework for the exchange of information and administrative co-operation among national authorities and between them and the Commission.</p>
<p>As far as the Candidate Countries are concerned, the Commission is convinced that the efforts made by them, with Community support, to implement the stringent standards of intellectual property (IP) protection in place in the Community will lead to a significant improvement in their enforcement actions.</p>
<p>In the case of other third countries, which are World Trade Organization (WTO) members, the Commission pursues a very close monitoring of their commitments to create or amend their legal framework in order to comply with the minimum standards imposed by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs). In the Community's bilateral free-trade and association agreements with third countries there is a substantial chapter that typically requires from our Partners that they adopt and implement the highest international standards of IP protection. These provisions usually also involve commitments to provide technical assistance to help them improve their Intellectual Property Reports (IPR) enforcement.</p>
<p>The Commission is also willing to work with countries individually or via multilateral contacts, notably in the WTO and World Intellectual Property rights organisation (WIPO), to further strengthen the enforcement of IP rights.</p>
<p>The Commission is also organising a meeting of the Forum on the Prevention of Organised Crime with relevant public and private sector stakeholders, scheduled for December 2002. One aim would be to have increased protection for the citizen and business, as well as helping candidate countries to introduce adequate levels of control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0617"></a>

<p>(EN) The specific agricultural measures taken by the Commission in August and September in response to the unprecedented flooding which has occurred especially in central Europe, include the following:</p>
<p>A derogation for the flood-affected regions of Germany and Austria as well as parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom allowing land set-aside under the arable crops scheme to be used for animal grazing as from 9 August 2002, provided that at least 33% of the forage area of the holding has been flooded;</p>
<p>The payment before 16 October 2002 of a 50% advance on the direct payments for arable aid in the affected regions of Germany;</p>
<p>The sale to Austrian livestock producers of 30 600 tonnes of intervention stocks of cereals at 50 €/tonne or about half the normal price;</p>
<p>The announcement by the Commission that it is ready to adopt a flexible approach where the Member States concerned seek to adapt their rural development programmes in order to deal with the consequences of the floods;</p>
<p>For candidate countries affected by the floods, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the presentation of a proposal to amend the Sapard Regulation in order to increase the aid intensity from 50% to 75% for beneficiaries in areas affected by exceptional natural disasters and to increase the Community contribution from 75% to 85% of total public expenditure in these areas.</p>
<p>As far as this year’s budget is concerned, the decision on advance payments of arable aid in Germany has the effect of bringing forward from 2003 to 2002 an expenditure of about EUR 560 million whilst the decision on reduced price sales of cereals in Austria involves a cost of nearly EUR 2 million.</p>
<p>Given that a decision was also taken in August to authorise advance payments in 2002 of arable aid in Southern Italy for an amount of about EUR 330 million, the measures taken in relation to the exceptional weather conditions of this summer involve a total cost of nearly EUR 900 million and have the effect of sharply reducing the size of the underspend of agricultural appropriations on the 2002 budget.</p>
<p>More recently, the Commission has taken further action which will help to alleviate the cash-flow difficulties of livestock producers affected by the floods, notably by authorising Member States to pay an advance on the beef premiums of 80% instead of 60%, as from 16 October 2002. However, given that the financing period of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee for 2002 ended on 15 October, these advances will remain booked to the 2003 financial year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0620"></a>

<p>(EN) In 1997, the Commission adopted an “Action Plan (1997-2000) on environment issues in the administration of the Commission<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>”, better known as the Green Housekeeping programme. The objective of this action plan was to ‘ensure that the Commission will be applying the highest standards of environmental care across the whole range of its administration and be seen to be taking a lead on this’. It comprised 31 actions to be undertaken in three main areas, namely, office activities, mobility and housing. Many of these actions aim at reducing energy consumption. Following this Action Plan, the Commission, inter alia, introduced environmental criteria into calls for tender for the purchase of electrical equipment such as computers and lighting systems, purchased electrical vehicles for shuttling the maintenance service between buildings, and bought service bikes to be available for staff commuting between buildings. A final report was issued in May 2001<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and a follow-up report covering Green Housekeeping activities was approved on 30<span class="sup">th</span> May 2002<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission adopted a Decision<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> to implement the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), initially as a pilot project, in the General Secretariat, Directorat General (DG) Environment and DG Personnel and Administration. EMAS is a voluntary scheme for organisations that are willing to commit themselves to evaluate and continuously improve their environmental performance according to the EMAS II Regulation<a href="#defann_30_5" name="refann_30_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. The two-year pilot project will carry on some of the Green Housekeeping activities on the basis of an environmental management system. Moreover, through the initial review stage, EMAS will look into other areas of activities where significant environmental impact can be ascertained. The findings stemming from the initial review will set the baseline from which performance improvement can subsequently be measured.</p>
<p>EMAS in the Commission started in September 2002. Over the next few months EMAS will undertake actions related to the internal awareness raising strategy and the initial review of the environmental impacts. If this pilot phase proves to be successful, the Commission may decide to seek EMAS registration for all of its services.</p>
<p>Independent accredited verifiers will systematically audit the performance of EMAS in the Commission. An environmental statement will be released to provide relevant environmental information to the public and other interested parties. The expected results will benefit the overall environmental performance of the Commission and set a good example to others in the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Authorisation procedure provided for in the White Paper on Chemicals Policy aims at controlling substances of very high concern. These are substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or substances toxic to reproduction (CMR substances categories 1 and 2), and substances with the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The White Paper also provides that criteria for the identification of persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic substances (PBTs), and very persistent and very bio-accumulative substances (VPVBs) should be developed, before deciding on how to treat such substances. The criteria have reached a mature state of development, and their inclusion under the Authorisation procedure is currently under consideration. Also the possible inclusion of endocrine disrupters and respiratory sensitisers is subject to debate.</p>
<p>It is important to make the Authorisation procedure a workable system that delivers. The Commission is therefore exploring every avenue to keep it as practical as possible, while maintaining the goal of a high level of protection from the substances of very high concern.</p>
<p>The Commission has considered a range of substance and product related provisions in Community legislation and their possible link to the future chemicals legislation. However, since the future legislation is still under development, it is not possible to provide a detailed view on the provisions that may require amendment.</p>
<p>Safety data sheets will continue to provide important information on chemical substances also under the new system. However, this information would not be sufficient for Registration, because Registration will also require a risk assessment. The Commission has taken note of the exposure category system proposed in a project set up by the German Chemical Industry Association under the guidance of Öko-Institut Freiburg and is considering it in its drafting of the future chemicals legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0622"></a>

<p>(EN) The provisions of Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> were transposed in the United Kingdom by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 ("TUPE").</p>
<p>The Court of Justice, in its judgement of 8 June 1994<a href="#defann_33_3" name="refann_33_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, declared that, "by failing to provide for the designation of employee representatives where an employer does not agree to it, by excluding non-profit-making undertakings from the scope of the United Kingdom Regulations designed to implement Council Directive 77/187/EEC (...), by not requiring a transferor or transferee who envisages measures in relation to his employees to consult their representatives in good time on such measures with a view to seeking agreement, and by failing to provide for effective sanctions in the event of the employer' s failure to inform and consult employee representatives, the United Kingdom has failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive and under Article 5 of the EEC Treaty."</p>
<p>Following this judgement of the Court, the United Kingdom adopted the Collective Redundancies and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (Amendment) Regulations 1999, in order to comply with Council Directive 77/187/CEE and with the judgement of the Court of Justice.</p>

The Greek authorities have been asked to provide for the restoration of the site's wetlands and for the improvement of its ecological conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, progress has been made towards the establishment of the national park. In August 2002 the Greek authorities sent to the Commission a new file containing the necessary technical information for the inclusion of the Schinias/Marathon site in the national list of proposed sites for the Natura 2000 network. The official transmission of the file is now expected.</p>
<p>Concerning the archaeological findings that the excavation has brought to light, the Commission does not have any direct responsibility for protecting the archaeological value of the site.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the report “UK strategy for radioactive discharges 2001-2020”, published by the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in July 2002 and the document “Proposed decision for the future regulation of disposals of radioactive waste from British Nuclear Fuels plc Sellafield” published by the British Environment Agency in August 2002. Both documents contain detailed regulatory information, which reflects the transparency required in the area of environmental radioactivity.</p>
<p>The Commission supports the efforts of the United Kingdom to strengthen regulatory control in the way described in these documents. The proposed decision lowers the discharge limits for the majority of radionuclides concerned, while preserving them as they are for the rest. It is the opinion of the Commission that the new discharge limits and the new regulatory instructions contained in these documents will help Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR) judge compliance with its objectives by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>As regards the Sellafield facility, the proposed new limits will not reduce the amount of radioactivity released to the Irish Sea in the short term. It should be borne in mind that the current Sellafield discharges are very small when compared to the historical discharges in the 1970’s.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0641"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is satisfied by the 30 August decision of the World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrators which authorises the Union to impose sanctions at the level of US $ 4 billion on United States (US) products. This decision fully vindicates Union’s approach. The arbitrators have given us an amount of potential countermeasures which will create a major incentive for the United States to eliminate this huge illegal export subsidy.</p>
<p>On Sanctions</p>
<p>Concerning sanctions, on 13 September the Commission published a Notice in the Official Journal containing a list of products proposed to be covered by any retaliatory measures with a view to consult Union industry on the effect of these measures. In line with WTO practice (also followed by the US) the list is set at a higher level than the amount set by the arbitrator (US $ 4 billion) in order to allow for exclusion of products following a 60-day consultation procedure.</p>
<p>Obviously, the aim of the consultation is to minimise the negative consequences that any eventual sanctions could create to Union industry but also to transatlantic trade; in that respect, the Commission has included in the list products on which the US import share is low. After consultation of Union industry and of Member States the Commission intends to present the final list to the WTO and launch the internal legislative procedure.</p>
<p>On US compliance</p>
<p>The US Administration has made clear its intention to comply (eg see President Bush statement during the last EU-US Summit, US Trade Representative and Treasury statements during the recent Senate Finance Committee hearing). However, we are still waiting for details on the compliance programme.</p>
<p>The Commission is getting encouraging signs that this time the Congress (notably Chairman Thomas) are making serious efforts to present a draft Bill to comply with the WTO rulings. Furthermore, a bipartisan and bicameral hearing (with the participation of the US administration) is expected to take place on this issue. The Commission, therefore, very much expects to see serious progress on compliance within the current session of Congress.</p>
<p>Decisions on sanctions will be made depending on US progress towards compliance. The Commission will carefully evaluate progress made in terms of implementation by the US before any decisions are taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0643"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission would question the existence of significant prices rises relating to the introduction of the euro. According to the analysis carried out by Eurostat and published last July, consumer prices in the euro zone, measured by the Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI), increased by 1.4% during the first six months of 2002 and the last six months of 2001. 1.2 per cent of the increase can be explained by historic inflation trends and by specific factors not relating directly to the introduction of the euro (climate conditions, indirect taxes ...). The inflationary impact relating to the introduction of euro notes and coins is therefore limited (maximum 0.2%), although it is slightly higher than previous estimates (maximum 0.16%). In the majority of Member States, national statistical bodies or central banks have made similar estimates, which also indicate generally limited effects. Nevertheless, in certain sectors unusual price rises have been observed (restaurants and cafés, health services, small shops etc.). These increases combined with the unfavourable rounding up of prices on certain common consumer items may have contributed to giving the public the impression of a more significant inflationary effect than that indicated by the official indices encompassing all goods and services consumed. Globally, however, inflation has decreased since the beginning of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0644"></a>

<p>(EN) State aid can be granted to companies for regional purposes taking into account the specific conditions of economic development that apply in the region concerned.

<p>Firstly, the Commission has laid down, in the guidelines on national regional aid<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, provisions which oblige the beneficiaries of national aid, just as for structural aid, to maintain any investment or employment created for a five-year period. Secondly, and in the same vein, the Structural Funds regulations stipulate that the contribution from the funds in productive activities is only provided on the condition that the location of these activities does not change in the five years following the decision on contribution<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Therefore, aid granted to investments that do not remain in the assisted region for at least five years must be reimbursed. The rules on national aid are already in force in the candidate countries, whilst those relating to Structural Funds will apply to candidate countries as soon as they join the Union.</p>
<p>Austria is supported by European regional policy financed under the Structural funds. For the period 2000-2006, EUR 889 million have been dedicated to the six Austrian Bundesländer bordering candidate countries (Burgenland, Steiermark, Oberösterreich, Niederösterreich, Kärnten and Vienna) in the framework of the Objective 1 and 2 programmes. In addition, under the Austrian Interreg IIIA programmes with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, approximately € 110 million has been allocated for the period 2000-2006 for programmes of co-operation.</p>

<p>(EN) The question of compliance with Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> as amended, in relation to the proposed construction of the South East Motorway in the Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown area of Dublin and its impact on the archaeological remains of the Carrickmines Castle Complex, is undergoing active investigation by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Irish authorities have been requested by Commission correspondence of 1 October 2002 to provide information on compliance with Directive 85/337/EEC in terms of the information on archaeological impacts that informed the decision-making process and the impact of the road project on the archaeological heritage of the Carrickmines Castle complex. The Irish authorities have been asked to respond within one month.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have the power to insist that the Irish Government cease work on the entire site in view of its imminent destruction and await a revised and complete environmental impact assessment. Moreover, the preparation of a road project and study of cost and alternatives are matters for the relevant authorities in the Member States. The Commission has no powers in these areas.</p>
<p>Insofar as the question of Community funding of this project is concerned, where the Commission investigation evidences any inappropriate use of Community funding the appropriate action will be taken at that time.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may be assured that this matter is receiving the fullest attention of the Commission services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission notes that the establishment of the Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has given rise to some concerns on the part of farmers and other landowners in the west of Ireland. The Irish authorities stressed to the Commission that the process of nominating SACs has been proceeded with detailed consultation with landowners and contacts with farmers representatives, with a view to explaining the objectives of the directive and allaying unfounded fears about its implications for future land use.</p>
<p>Some of these concerns may be linked to measures to tackle the widespread problem of overgrazing by sheep on commonage land in parts of the west of Ireland, as is recognised by the recent judgement of the Court of Justice<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This highlighted the need to establish corrective measures to avoid serious long-term damage to vegetation and soil erosion in the affected areas. Countering these adverse phenomena is, in the Commission’s view, prudent and necessary. This is not only from the perspective of nature conservation but also from that of long term sustainable agriculture and other land based economic activities such as tourism.</p>
<p>It should be noted that farmers in Ireland whose land is within proposed SACs are eligible for payments under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) additional to the standard payments for the delivery of agri-environmental services within the overall context of the REPS under Ireland’s Rural Development Programme. While there are no plans to formally review the Habitats Directive the Commission is examining, in partnership with the Member States and different interest groups, the issue of future financing of the Natura 2000 network, including the possibilities that may exist under different Community funds. The intention is to produce a Communication to Parliament and Council on this subject in 2003. The Commission also encourages Member States to develop approaches to implement the directive, in partnership with different stakeholders, which will have the effect of maximising its workability and effectiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not supporting population programmes for which funding has been withdrawn by the United States, and is not supporting programmes that make abortion an instrument of population policy.</p>
<p>However, the Commission is concerned about the gap created in funding for the United Nations’ Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) by the current United States administration. In this context, the Commission has developed a €22 million reproductive health programme under the 8<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF), in collaboration with the United Nations and the IPPF. This recently approved programme is aimed at improving the capacities of 22 of the poorest African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) to deliver basic reproductive health services to vulnerable and under-served communities. It is not intended to fill the gap created in the core budget of United Nations’ Population Fund by the withdrawal of United States support. The Commission has full confidence in both United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and IPPF, and both are longstanding partners.</p>
<p>The Union’s policy on abortion is based on the set of principles that has been adopted through a series of major development conferences over recent years. The ability of men and women to make a free and informed choice about the number and spacing of their children, access to good family planning and sexual health services, access to skilled care during birth, are all fundamental rights that the Commission supports.</p>
<p>Support for reproductive health programmes will prevent the need for abortion. However, the Commission recognises that abortion is a reality and causes the unnecessary deaths of many women each year. The Commission will continue to uphold the principle agreed at the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo 1994, which states that where abortion is not against the law it should be made safe and women should have equal access to quality services. The Commission does not support abortion policies as a means to limit population growth in developing countries and is strongly opposed to compulsory abortion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0655"></a>

<p>Following the exposure of administrative irregularities, approximately 1500 members of the Ilia Industrial Tomato Growers Association have not received subsidies for the 2001 harvest, an amount totalling some 43 million euro. Furthermore, there is a risk that they may not receive the subsidy for the current 2002 production. The Community and national authorities may, after carrying out checks, impose the prescribed penalties on those responsible for the irregularities and simultaneously release the amounts in question for payment to those members of the association who are entitled to them and bear no responsibility for the irregularities.</p>
<p>What steps will the Commission take to enable those farmers who are entitled to subsidies to obtain them?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The subsidies referred to by the honourable Member in his question are laid down in Council Regulation 2201/96 of 28 October 1996<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, establishing a system of Community subsidies for producers’ organisations that give up the processing, amongst other products, of tomatoes harvested within the Community. This system of subsidies is based on contracts binding, on the one hand, producers organised into producers’ organisations (PO) recognised in accordance with Regulation 2200/96<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and, on the other, processors approved by the competent authorities. The aid is granted to producers’ organisations who in turn award it to their members.</p>
<p>The recognition of a producer’s organisation is the responsibility of the Member States, who, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations and the Commission’s implementing provisions, lay down a series of criteria to be met by the producers’ organisation so that they can benefit from Community assistance. The Member State is also responsible for carrying out controls relating to that system of subsidies, and for applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions where necessary.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the legislator has not provided for a scenario where the individual producer may be eligible for aid, regardless of the existence or behaviour of the producers’ organisation. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the statute of a PO, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 2200/96, must include rules guaranteeing that the associated producers have democratic control of their organisation and of their decisions, as well as penalties for violation of either statutory obligations or rules established by the producers’ organisation.</p>
<p>With regard to the case in question, according to the information available to the Commission, the honourable Member’s question appears to relate to the producers’ organisation ‘C.A. de Gastouni’. The services of the Commission have already expressed their opinion on this case by means of a letter dated 25 May 2002 addressed to the Greek authorities and they have initiated a procedure within the framework of the auditing of accounts. According to the Greek authorities, this group of producers, recognised as a producers’ organisation in 1997, has never met the recognition criteria set by the Community legislation. The Community budget cannot under any circumstances take responsibility for non-eligible expenditure, in other words, expenditure with regard to which the criteria established by Community law are not met. Therefore, the expenditure relating to aid for the processing of tomatoes by ‘C.A. de Gastouni’ is not eligible for co-funding by the Community as from the date on which the recognition conditions ceased to be met.</p>
<p>A different problem of eligibility for Community co-funding arises if the PO ‘C.A. de Gastouni’ is authorised to receive aid for the processing of tomatoes, provided that the Greek authorities have recognised it and that that recognition has not been withdrawn. This issue is to be decided by those authorities on the basis of national law. It should be pointed out that this possible ‘national’ payment should be judged in accordance with its conformity to the Community rules relating to State subsidies.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore regrets to have to tell the honourable Member that it will not be able to take any action in support of the farmers mentioned in the question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has approved state aid and loan guarantees totalling 6.5 billion to a large pulp mill in Stendal, Germany.

This is hardly consistent with the Commission's duty under Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to ensure that there is no distortion of competition at EU level. The consequences of this decision will be that companies in this industry in other countries will not be competing on a level playing field. Södra, a company in Sweden, has independently financed acquisitions and plant at a cost of some SEK 7 billion. Naturally, the Commission's decision to approve state aid and loan guarantees in Germany is viewed as a severe blow to that Swedish company. A similar case has also arisen.

<p>The Commission has presented a proposal to the Tobacco Management Committee which doubles Community subsidies for buying back production quotas. Parliament and Council agreed this year simply to extend the sector's support regime, although the Commission was seeking a compromise whereby Community subsidies would be gradually abolished. Now the Commission is proposing, in the shape of a management regulation, to modify ‘set-aside’ subsidies so substantially that the move appears to be less a mere seasonal adjustment than a 'surreptitious' reform of the COM. This means that Council prerogatives are being usurped. Has the Commission not reflected that the proposal may violate Article 14a of Regulation (EEC) 2075/92<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which lays down that 'the quota buy-back price should not be such as to encourage any excessive exodus of producers from the sector’?

<p>(FR) The common organisation of the market in raw tobacco comprises a series of measures each of which should be considered according to its own merit.</p>
<p>The buy-back programmes are intended to help tobacco producers who wish, on a voluntary basis, to convert their production.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the Council has given the Commission the mandate to set quota buy-back prices which must not encourage an excessive exodus of producers from the sector. Furthermore, it is the Commission’s responsibility to monitor the efficiency and good operation of the measures adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that previous buy-back prices have not produced the expected effects.</p>
<p>It seemed essential for the Commission to set the prices at a level more favourable to producers in the sector bearing in mind the need to maintain a balance between the variety groups and the difficulties relating to certain of them.</p>
<p>Following consultation with professionals and a broad debate with the Member States, the Commission presented a final proposal to the Management Committee for Tobacco on 16 October 2002. This proposal, which relates to the setting of quota buy-back prices for the 2002 and 2003 harvests, essentially provides for an increase in the level of these prices for all variety groups in comparison with the prices set in 2001 with a greater rise for variety groups III and V which are experiencing problems accessing the market. Furthermore, the buy-back prices are also modulated in accordance with the size of production quotas. Finally, the period for the granting of these buy-back payments is extended from three to five years.</p>
<p>The draft regulation has received the favourable opinion of the large majority of Member States. Its approach responds to the main objective of this measure and it should not disturb the Community’s tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to point out to the honourable Member that this measure cannot be directly linked to the quality of production. The common organisation of the market in raw tobacco also lays down specific measures aimed at improving this quality.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Freedom of movement for labour between the Member States is a fundamental part of the Treaty and important in facilitating citizens' access to a bigger labour market. In reality, however, freedom of movement is hindered by Member States' red tape. For example, a person who has worked in Spain has had to wait three months for the administrative information which entitles her to unemployment benefit in Sweden. The consequence of this is that she has to wait several months for her benefit, which does not, of course, promote freedom of movement of labour and also means that individuals have to pay the price for the sluggishness of administrative procedures between the Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member and has continuously expressed its concern at the rate of return of Afghans to Afghanistan - both organised and spontaneous - that has been more rapid and massive than expected. The Commission has therefore from the beginning made this concern the main rationale behind its support to Afghan refugees, focusing on the sustainability of the return in order to ensure that this summer’s returnees don’t become next winter’s refugees.</p>
<p>The cumulative total of those who have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan since March under the repatriation programme is 1.5 million, many of them flooding into Kabul and Jalalabad, although the pace of returns from Pakistan has begun to reduce. The United Nations estimates that up to 400,000 refugees have entered Kabul over the past four months under destitute conditions. A further 116,000 have returned from Iran. Some 800,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) remain in Afghanistan, largely due to prolonged drought and the prevailing security situation in parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In order to support the sustainable reintegration of those who have returned or been internally displaced, the Commission has so far provided over 3 million man days of work this year under its rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programme in the framework of its Initial Recovery programme. 450 primary schools and over 200 clinics and hospitals have also been rehabilitated with the same aim of providing a sustainable environment for reintegration and recovery. Another € 15 million will be made available for social sectors under its Second Recovery Programme. All this comes on top of humanitarian relief that amounts thus far to € 60 million most of which is directed at refugees, IDPs and returnees (the remainder being assistance to victims of the Narhim earth quake). The Commission has also co-funded massive mine clearing operations, another crucial element assisting the sustainable recovery of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the ongoing discussions of a common repatriation policy, the Commission, starting in February this year, has organised a series of meetings with experts of Members States and International organisations with a view to deepening the understanding of the migration issues as they are presently evolving in Afghanistan, its neighbouring region and in Europe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the European Council meeting in Seville discussed the issue and adopted the following conclusion: “…adoption by the end of the year, of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Commission Green Paper; those components should include the best possible facilities for early return to Afghanistan”. This remit has been discussed at the informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) ministerial in Copenhagen, 13 September 2002 in the presence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. On that occasion the member of the Commission in charge of external relations underlined the large support the Community was extending to Afghanistan in order to facilitate returns. At the Strategy Committee Immigration Frontiers and Asylum (SCIFA) meeting 25-26 September 2002, the Danish presidency presented a note containing an outline of an Union plan for repatriation to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The following are central to the Commission's approach as regard the return of refugees to Afghanistan:</p>
<p>Migration issues will be incorporated into our global strategy on Afghanistan. A new Country Strategy Paper is due this autumn;</p>
<p>It is clear from discussions with Member States that the implementation of any return programme can not be envisaged before spring 2003 at the earliest. The Commission is of the opinion that forced returns at this point in time would be counter-productive;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned expert meetings have been able to create a useful platform for the sharing of information both between Member States and the Commission as well as international organisations. The Commission will continue to play its role concerning this forum. First of all these meetings will aim at fulfilling the expressed needs of the Member States for close monitoring and assessment of the situation on the ground. Relevant international organisations and Non governmental organisations (NGOs) including Amnesty International will be invited to these meetings;</p>
<p>The Commission will discuss with Member States the need for co-ordination at the European level;</p>
<p>Member States will, naturally, keep full responsibility for setting up their national agenda concerning return, but it is essential that this should take place in a co-ordinated framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.</p>
<p>The concept has since been expanded to ‘reproductive health and sexual health and rights’, which embrace certain rights that are already recognised in international human rights documents. They include the rights of couples and individuals to: decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children, to have the information and means to do so, and to attain the highest level of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p>The issue of paedophilia has never been the subject of discussion in international fora on reproductive health and sexual health and rights. However, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all Member States are parties, clearly states that all children have the right to be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a Regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries will provide the legal basis for the funding of activities that are aimed at reducing the very high death rates of women in developing countries during pregnancy and childbirth. The text of the Regulation is still under discussion. However, that in line with present policies, it will not provide incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion in developing countries.

The sum of the Community aid requested is EUR 80.121 million bearing in mind an eligible expenditure of EUR 155.244 million.</p>
<p>The project involves the implementation of seven elements for which the total costs per element are as follows: CORTES (EUR 44.65 million), CUESTA (EUR 40.95 million), LOS MACHOS (EUR 37.54 million), NAVALON (EUR 30.31 million), LA FONT (EUR 22.69 million), VILLENA (EUR 13.89 million), SAN DIEGO (EUR 40.31 million). A proportion of these expenses has not been taken into account in the request for Community co-funding.</p>
<p>The Commission is dealing with this case on the basis of the documentation forwarded by the Spanish authorities, which includes the declaration of environmental impact and the ‘Natura 2000’ declaration of the competent authority.</p>
<p>In view of the time limits laid down in Article 26(3) of Council Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999, the Commission will have to give its opinion on the levels of co-funding of the request within a maximum time limit of three months as from 4 October 2002, the date of the presentation of the request to the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0680"></a>

<p>(EN) The real human suffering facing coffee producers is one part, albeit the most pressing, of the broader problem of the commodity dependence of the world’s poorest countries. Over the long term diversification is the solution, requiring a comprehensive approach to trade and development. This approach is set out in the Commission Communication on trade and development<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and is at the heart of the Doha Development Agenda which has development as the guiding principle of the multilateral trade negotiations, in order to build a multilateral trading system which takes full account of the economic, social and environmental constraints of developing countries. The Union has already taken a significant step with the Everything But Arms Initiative which grants duty free access for all products originating from less developed countries (LDCs). The Economic Partnership Agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) and the Union will also deepen the link between trade and development, by integrating further the different dimensions of the Cotonou agreement, notably programming and implementation of aid on one side, and trade and economic co-operation on the other.</p>
<p>The Commission also sees a role for fair trade in helping poor producers gain a greater share of the international market. It financed already activities which aim to raise European citizen's awareness of development problems and of Fair Trade. It also supports projects designed to develop codes of conduct and social labelling and backs the private-led efforts to rationalise the use of Fair Trade Labels.</p>
<p>At international level, the Commission is engaged within the International Coffee Organisation on the implementation of a quality support scheme. Started the 1<span class="sup">st</span> October 2002, it is too early to say what impact this scheme will have on the market. According to the results, the Union may examine possible ways of contribution.</p>
<p>What further measures are to be supported by the Commission in the immediate future is being considered by an inter service working group in consultation with non governmental organisations (NGOs), including Oxfam, and large coffee roasters. A series of proposals are being examined, in the light of the lessons of the past, and the Commission will keep the Parliament informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 establishes at Community level, the model for the certificate of inspection for imported 'organic' goods. This model shall apply from 1 November 2002. The draft Regulation was notified to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in accordance with the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) procedure in due time. Apart from a reaction from the United States authorities no comments were received.</p>
<p>This Commission Regulation lays down detailed rules implementing the general import conditions of the basic Regulation on organic farming. The basic Regulation namely, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on 'organic farming', foresees amongst others a certificate of inspection for imported 'organic' goods. In the actual situation import certificates are already, and have been, requested for several years for 'organic' produce imported in the framework of equivalency recognised at Community level.</p>
<p>The effect of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 is to extend the requirement of the certificate to imports of 'organic' produce authorised by the Member States on a case by case basis. As most developing countries exporting 'organic' goods to the Community use this latter procedure, this extension is of particular importance to them. However, even the Codex Alimentarius guidelines on 'Organically produced Foods', recommend requiring a certificate for imports.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken care that Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 will not impose complicated, bureaucratic procedures considering that:</p>
<p>The authority or body in the third country issuing the certificate only has to declare that the products comply with the agreed equivalent requirements. In other words that the 'organic' products described in the certificate have been obtained in accordance with rules of production and inspection agreed to be equivalent to those foreseen in Community legislation. The principles laid down in the Community legislation apply in an equivalent manner both to goods produced or prepared inside the Community and to those imported from third countries. In this regard, any possible amendment of the Community legislation in the future will certainly not differ from that principle.</p>
<p>The competent authorities in the Member States already have an obligation to certify imports where they have granted such an import authorisation. This check is essential in order to guarantee the integrity of organic products.</p>
<p>The certificate has to accompany the consignment from the moment the latter enters the Community. Member States have defined the relevant Member States' authorities (in most cases customs authorities) who shall verify the consignments of 'organic produce and endorse the certificate. For all animal produce and plant products from regions subject to phytosanitary restrictions, similar procedures are already in place.</p>
<p>The implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 will contribute to ensure consumer confidence in 'organic' produce. This is essential for ensuring a sustained demand and therefore the future of the 'organic' production method. This will subsequently have a positive effect on the marketing opportunities for developing countries. In fact, if consumers maintain their confidence in 'organic' farming, developing countries will continue to have access to a steady market for 'organic' products. This concerns in many cases products which, for climatic reasons, cannot be produced within the Community.</p>
<p>The implementation of such a certificate is not contrary to the commitment of the Community at the recent World Summit of Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. The agreement at the WSSD was to "support voluntary WTO compatible market-based initiatives for the creation and expansion of domestic and international markets for environmentally friendly goods and services, including organic products, which maximise environmental and developmental benefits through, inter alia, capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries". A vital part of creating and maintaining markets in the Community for the organic products of developing countries is providing consumers with the assurance that such products meet Community standards. This is the object of our legislation.</p>
<p>In addition, and in accordance with the commitments taken by the Community in Doha, the Commission is working on the possibilities offered by various financial instruments to support developing countries’ efforts to participate in the elaboration of and to comply with international trade regulations. In particular, the Community is in the process of reviewing the on-going activities in this field and to identify additional requirements to make sure that these countries will be in a position to trade their goods of animal and/or horticultural origin on regional, inter-regional or international markets. These supports could include supporting the national Competent Authorities to carry out the necessary controls to deliver the appropriate certificates required by importing countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member asks why the Commission would view data retention as a necessary response to the terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that data retention is one tool – among others - available to Member States when necessary to safeguard certain public interests, such as national security or the investigation and prosecution of crime, as illustrated in Article 15 (1) of the new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (the current Directive 97/66/EC will be repealed by 31 October 2003). This reference is however neither a requirement to adopt data retention measures, nor a blank check for Member States that would wish to introduce such measures.</p>
<p>Community law imposes certain legal constraints on Member States with regard to any national measures requiring operators to store traffic data for law enforcement purposes beyond the provision of the service and the billing of that service. In accordance with the new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, such national measures may only be adopted if they are necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, and they may only require data to be retained for a limited period. Whether these conditions have been met, can only be analysed case-by-case, on the basis of the justification provided by Member States that such measures are necessary for the protection of the public interests invoked.</p>
<p>The Commission is now trying to clarify as much as possible how national measures can be best reconciled with the legal requirements stemming from Community law, from the European Convention on Human Rights and from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, bearing in mind the respective limits of the Commission’s powers under the first and third pillars. These discussions have not yet been completed and the Commission therefore considers premature to draw any conclusions on whether there is a need for any legislative action at Union level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last 18 months, the Danish competition authority, Konkurrencestyrelsen, has been investigating possible illegal methods of setting prices and price agreements among petrol companies.

<p>The petrol companies' activities may be regarded as cross-border for a number of reasons. Firstly, cross-border trade between Denmark and Germany and between Denmark and Sweden is quite considerable, including the purchase of petrol. Secondly, the petrol market is controlled by multinational corporations whose pricing policy is not necessarily determined in one particular country but rather at headquarters some distance removed from the individual national market.

<p>(EN) The Commission has discussed competition policy in the motor fuel sector with the National Competition Authorities in recent years. This included specific meetings with all National Competition Authorities in September and November 2000<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It emerged in the course of these meetings that agreements regarding prices in the motor fuel sector, when they exist, are currently more likely to be organised at national than at Community level. It was therefore agreed that national competition authorities would make it their priority to detect and prosecute such anti-competitive behaviour, unless cross-border aspects emerge. It should also be noted that, in the context of the Commission’s new policy on vertical restraints, national competition authorities have received the power to deal with anticompetitive vertical restraints and withdraw the block exemption for vertical agreements – previously an exclusive Commission power<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. National authorities are thus fully empowered to take action against restrictions caused by agreements the effects of which are felt mainly in their territory in accordance with the principles for case allocation between the Commission and the national competition authorities<a href="#defann_69_3" name="refann_69_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This general policy was expressly restated as regards national motor fuel markets in the joint meetings held with the National Competition Authorities to discuss competition policy in this sector. This explains why the Danish or the Dutch competition authorities are dealing with such cases.</p>
<p>In these meetings, it was also noted that where independent operators have a significant presence (for example France, United Kingdom and Germany) motor fuel markets are more competitive than retail markets where vertically-integrated suppliers have a strong presence. The Commission agreed with National Competition Authorities that it will focus on addressing any State or private barriers in the wholesale market for non-vertically-integrated independent companies. The findings of the subsequent Commission investigation were presented to the National Competition Authorities in a meeting in November 2001. These findings have already proved to be useful. For example, in a recent proposal for a Directive adopted on 11 September 2002, the Commission proposes to modify the security stockholding requirements, in particular, but not only, with regard to small operators, so as to facilitate cross-border trade<a href="#defann_69_4" name="refann_69_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>According to the findings of a three-month survey by a scientific team from the Metsovo National Institute of Technology, radioactivity levels in the entire area of Valtetsion in Arkadia greatly exceed maximum permissible levels. The atmospheric radioactivity readings greatly exceeded natural radioactivity ceilings and, at times, depending on wind speeds, radioisotope levels were so high as to render the measuring device inoperative. Whilst scientists are sounding the alarm for this area and the Megalopolis municipalities, the Greek Energy Commission has responded by issuing reassurances while at the same time rejecting requests for further studies.</p>
<p>Given that this area is considered to be one of those with the lowest environmental standards in Greece and that local vegetation has been permeated by radioisotopes, with manifestly extremely serious consequences for the food chain and biocycle, what steps will the Commission take to ensure that the investigations are followed up and that appropriate measures are taken to shield those who work and live in the area and protect the environment in general?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission was not aware of the scientific study carried out by the National Institute of Technology in Athens which is mentioned in the honourable Member’s question. The Commission has therefore asked the Greek authorities to provide it with information relating to a possible increase in levels of radioactivity in the region of Valtetsion in Arkadia. Those authorities have informed us that the study in question relates to the problem of pollution originating from the lignite power station in Megalopoli.</p>
<p>The monitoring of radioactivity levels in the environment within the territory of the Member States falls within the legal obligations of those States in accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Euratom Treaty. The Greek authorities regularly communicate to the Commission information relating to the controls of these levels of radioactivity. Furthermore, professional activities carried out in the presence of natural sources of radiation which involve a considerable increase in the exposure of workers and members of the public are covered by the provisions of Title VII of Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation<span class="sup"> <a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities have indicated that they have a continuous monitoring site for external radiation within the power station and that they take systematic measurements of aerosols and storage sites on the land close to the power station. They have pointed out that the results of the measurements taken at these sites do not show any abnormal rise in levels of radioactivity and are comparable to the levels measured in other parts of the territory.</p>
<p>In view of the information communicated to the Commission by the Greek authorities, the data mentioned in the study in question do not appear to be very reliable and complementary measures to protect workers, members of the public and the environment do not appear to be justified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The World Summit for Sustainable Development can be considered a success in the area of water and sanitation, with the adoption of the sanitation target, the launch of the Community Water Initiative and the signature of the EU-Africa partnership on water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The goal is now to focus Union development co-operation programmes in this sector on the achievement of the targets agreed at the Summit, in a co-ordinated manner, promoting sector support approaches, in line with the Union character of the Initiative, and increased partnership with the private sector and civil society. Working with the African Ministerial Council on Water, the Union needs to ensure that national and regional strategies and programmes include the objectives and principles agreed in the EU-Africa partnership. At regional level, this will mean in particular tackling the issue of transboundary river basin management as a factor in regional integration and conflict prevention. The Union is in the process of identifying five river basins in Africa on which it would focus.</p>
<p>Engagement at country level, involving donors and key stakeholders active in the sector, governments and civil society in general, is a key for early delivery of results. Special attention will therefore be paid in a first phase to countries and regions where water is a focal area of the Community cooperation programme by integrating the principles and priorities of the Water Initiative.</p>
<p>The Multi-Stakeholder expert forum will continue to be the main body to develop the programmes of action, seeking synergies and complementarity between the Community and Member States and other partners.</p>
<p>The design phase of the initiative will continue in parallel to complete the definition of the building blocks in a series of working groups and consolidate partnerships, and to prepare a co-ordinated action programme, as well as to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism in order to measure progress in implementation and guide further action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0698"></a>

<p>(EN) As a follow-up to the 2001 Green Paper: Promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission adopted a new strategy on CSR on 2 July 2002<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which set out specific actions to increase knowledge on CSR, promote exchange of best practices, foster CSR among Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), facilitate convergence and transparency of CSR practices and instruments, launch a Multi-stakeholder Forum on CSR at Community level and integrate CSR into Communty policies.</p>
<p>The Commission launched the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR EMS Forum) on 16 October 2002 in the presence of the Members of the Commission responsible for Employment and Social Affairs, and Enterprise and the Information Society. About 20 major European representative organisations of employers, business networks, trade unions and civil society met at the high level meeting to adopt a document setting out the objectives, composition and operational aspects of the Forum and to have a first exchange of views. The Parliament, other Union institutions and further United Nations organisations were present as observers.</p>
<p>The Forum's objectives are to promote innovation, transparency and convergence of CSR through improving knowledge on CSR and exploring the appropriateness of establishing common guiding principles for CSR policies and instruments. The Forum will present a report to the Commission detailing the results of its work before summer 2004.</p>
<p>For many European SMEs, responsible entrepreneurship forms an integral part of their values. The challenge is, therefore, to build on SME's existing social commitment without creating additional administrative burdens. More SMEs can be involved through awareness-raising campaigns, the provision of information and tools by their trusted intermediaries (i.e. chambers of commerce). The European Multi-stakeholder Forum will provide a useful platform for the exchange of information on these efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In June the Commission adopted the Better Regulation Action Plan. A key action of this plan is the introduction of a new integrated procedure for impact assessment of all major proposals listed in the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy and Legislative and Work Programme. The new system integrates, streamlines and replaces all existing sectoral impact assessment mechanisms. The new procedure therefore replaces existing requirements for business impact assessment, environmental assessment, gender assessment etc. The Commission services will apply the principle of proportionate analysis in order to ensure that the level of analysis of Commission proposals is adapted to the significance of the likely impacts. The new procedure will also ensure that proposals are assessed at the onset of the policy design process.</p>
<p>To the extent that Commission proposals are likely to have an impact on businesses, and especially on Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these will be proportionately assessed within the new impact assessment procedure. In doing so, the recommendations of the final report of the Business Impact Assessment pilot project, which was published in March this year, will be taken into account. They include the quantification of impacts where relevant and possible.</p>
<p>The system will be introduced gradually starting in 2003 with a first selection of proposals. The new system will be fully operational from the adoption of the Annual Policy Strategy for 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0702"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to the extent of the trade in the products of illegal logging, no official estimates exist of the quantities marketed in breach of the exporting country's legislation. The commercial significance of the phenomenon needs to be viewed in proportion: 80% of all trade in forestry products is between developed countries, which are only marginally affected by illegal logging, and only 10-20% of the quantities logged are actually marketed.</p>
<p>The only estimates available on illegal logging are those provided by NGOs or international experts. They range from 10% to 50% of the total quantity logged in certain countries. However, even if we cannot be sure of the exact scope of the phenomenon, it is clear that it represents a fairly significant proportion of the forestry products of certain tropical countries and, in particular, certain transition states. The International Timber Organisation (ITTO) is carrying out a study to cross-check statistics on official imports and exports of certain timber-consuming and producing countries in order to determine discrepancies in these figures. Such discrepancies could give an indication of the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>As things stand, no means exist of officially identifying illegally logged timber or products manufactured using such timber. It is for the countries concerned to monitor the legality of forestry activities within their territory and ensure compliance with national law. Neither consumers nor EU Member States can act in place of the governments of the countries of origin to ensure such identification. Certain voluntary forest certification schemes include in their principles for granting of a 'label' conformity with national laws, so by implication such labelled produce would be certified to be legal. Also, trade in wood and wood products from species listed in Appendixes II and III of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) can only be conducted on the basis of certificates which testify, inter alia, that the products have been produced in accordance with national legislation. However, the volume of trade with developing countries carried out under forest certification schemes is modest and, under CITES, very limited.</p>
<p>With regard to action to end this trade, the Commission is currently preparing an action plan, following the recent Commission Communication to the Council and the Parliament<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provided that the European Union would 'develop a European Union action plan by end 2002 on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) to combat illegal logging and associated illegal trade and to strengthen international cooperation to address violations of forest law, and forest crime'. The objectives of this plan are to develop technical assistance measures and to define actions aimed at reinforcing global and national governance in respect of the exporter countries concerned, thus making it easier to identify the products of illegal logging and to contribute to the fight against such practices. Most of these measures will be instituted in close cooperation with the exporter countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

These include the Directives on electronic commerce (2000/31/EC) and electronic signatures (1999/93/EC).</p>
<p>As well as facilitating direct contact between producers and customers in a conventional way e-commerce has also given rise to new forms of business model, such as online auctioning and electronic marketplaces. As costs of using the Internet fall, notably as a result of competition and the Community’s policy in the field of electronic communications, e-commerce can provide relatively easy access for small producers to a global market. Such decisions should of course be left to the market players themselves.</p>
<p>A publication entitled "An overview of developments and prospects for e-commerce in the agricultural sector" can be found on http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/markets/e-commerce/index_en.htm. In this publication it is outlined that concerning the potential benefits of "agriculture online", e-commerce may offer solutions by integrating individual actors to improved organisational structures. This has the potential to improve market access through online transactions, by reducing geographical obstacles to market reach, such as time and distance, although it is clear that in principle the physical operation involved in delivering products of an acceptable standard remains. Furthermore e-commerce may encourage transport and logistical developments and further integration may even lead to a decline in auction markets. This may lead to minimising risks to animal welfare by reducing transport activities to a minimum and to animal health by avoiding contacts between animals of different origin.

<p>(EN) Working to eradicate poverty and social exclusion is a key policy priority of the Union. The ongoing process, launched at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, aims to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion by 2010. It encourages Member States to take a strategic and comprehensive approach to all aspects of poverty and social exclusion. It emphasises the need for a multi-dimensional approach which takes account of the complex and varied aspects of the problem. Within this an adequate income is a key element. This is reflected in the Common Objectives, adopted at the Nice European Council in December 2000, which in particular emphasise the need "to facilitate participation in employment" and "to organise social protection systems in such a way that they help, in particular, to: guarantee that everyone has the resources necessary to live in accordance with human dignity; overcome obstacles to employment by ensuring the take-up of employment results in increased income and by promoting employability."</p>
<p>The Joint Report on Social Inclusion, which was prepared by the Commission and Council and endorsed at the European Council in Laeken in December 2001, identifies eight core challenges for Member States in the struggle against poverty and social exlcusion. The second of these challenges is concerned with "guaranteeing an adequate income and resources to live in human dignity". Responsibility for particular policies in this area is primarily a matter for Member States. However, in its support for the Open Method of Coordination, the Commission will be encouraging Member States to take the issue of income adequacy fully into account. In particular the Commission will be encouraging Member States to address this issue in their next two year National Action Plans against poverty and social exclusion which are due in mid 2003. The Commission will also ensure that the Community action programme on social exclusion will enhance the collection and monitoring of data on income adequacy and will promote the exchange of learning and best practice between Member States on policies to address poverty.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of poverty and exclusion is addressed through other processes such as the European employment strategy and in particular the national action plans on employment and through the contribution of the Structural Funds to tackling social exclusion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0710"></a>

<p>At present, people aged 60 or older constitute 20% of the population of Europe. By 2050, it is anticipated that this proportion will double. This rapid growth shows that ageing will be one of the major challenges to be faced. The impact of this phenomenon on the economic and social development of the EU calls for coordinated action at European level with regard to various aspects (pensions, mobility, culture, education, inclusion, etc.) in order to ensure consistent and sustainable management, distinguishing those people who are merely elderly, who are still active and wholly or partially self-sufficient, from those defined as ‘old elderly’, who are not self-sufficient and require total assistance to maintain human dignity.</p>
<p>With reference to Articles 21, 25 and 34 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Articles 13 and 137 of the Amsterdam Treaty, could not the Commission do more to coordinate its measures relating to ageing so as to tackle this problem in a centralised manner?</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of the proposal to institute coordinated action on ageing? How will it implement this? What other action relating to ageing is proposed?</p>
<p>What will the Commission do to ensure that the elderly remain fully integrated into society? By what means can the Commission maintain the dignity of the lives of the ‘old elderly’?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As stated by the Commission in its contribution to the April 2002 United Nations World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid<a href="#defann_77_1" name="refann_77_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, over the past few years, Member States have committed themselves to collaboration on ageing issues in the context of sound public finances, employment, social protection and health and long term care while maintaining these as national policies and taking into account the diversity of ageing situations.</p>
<p>Ageing is not a separate issue to be tackled in isolation from other ones. The Union's response to ageing is therefore developed as part of the overall strategy of mutually reinforcing policies launched at the European Council meeting at Lisbon and elaborated at subsequent European Council meetings in Nice, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Laeken and Barcelona. As set out in the Economic Policy Coordination and the European Social Agenda it encompasses the economic, employment and social implications of ageing. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, which are the key instrument for economic policy co-ordination and provide the framework for policy recommendations and for monitoring the implementation of these recommendations, call for Member States to develop comprehensive strategies for addressing the economic challenge posed by ageing populations. The Social Policy Agenda, which lists Community policy priorities in employment and social affairs, outlines how Member States through mutually reinforcing employment, social protection and economic policies can deal with the wider social and work life related implications of ageing.</p>
<p>The Union approach to ageing aims at mobilising the full potential of people of all ages. the basic assumption is that adequate responses to ageing must go beyond attention to the presently old. Adjusting well to population ageing is an issue for people of all ages and a life course approach can help the development of adequate policy responses taking account of the related age and gender specific issues.</p>
<p>This results in an orientation towards active ageing policies and practices. Core active ageing practices include life long learning, working longer, retiring later and more gradually, being active after retirement and engaging in capacity enhancing and health sustaining activities. Such practices aim to raise the average quality of individual lives and at the same time, at societal level, contribute to larger growth, lower dependency burdens and substantial cost savings in pensions and health. They therefore represent win-win strategies for people of all ages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
