<p class="contents">As you know, the European Training Foundation was created in 1990 to support implementation of the PHARE external assistance programme in the field of vocational training. Currently its scope covers the countries of the previous TACIS, CARDS and MEDA programmes. The European Union’s policies in the education &amp; training and external relations fields have developed and the ETF regulation therefore needs to be updated to take account of those developments. The result is the Commission proposal on which you have been working.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal does not provide for any new ETF activities. Rather, its aim is to define its tasks more clearly on the basis of a broader thematic remit that includes the concept of human resources development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also expands the Foundation’s geographical scope in line with the EU’s new external relations instruments. In that new context, the ETF’s tasks therefore need to be adjusted, while remaining guided by the clearly established priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the European Parliament for addressing the Commission proposal in a positive manner. Thanks to good cooperation between the three institutions, we have managed to find solutions that satisfy all three of them, including on such sensitive issues as the composition of the Governing Board and the way in which the European Parliament can contribute its specific expertise. The Commission therefore accepts without hesitation the consolidated text resulting from last week’s constructive trilogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, on behalf of my colleague Jan Figel, by stressing how important it is for our cooperation to be successful, since that will allow the European Training Foundation to benefit from its new legal basis in due time and therefore provide more effective assistance to the beneficiary countries, which is, after all, obviously the purpose of this exercise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernard Lehideux, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. − </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was in Turin I was able to appreciate the excellent work done by the Foundation, which is a vital and highly effective instrument to promote the development of vocational training systems in EU partner countries. The Commission proposal updates the ETF’s tasks and governance to ensure that its activities are founded on a solid legal basis. In my view, the compromise reached with the Council offers progress in two essential directions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the new regulation will enable the Foundation to operate in all the EU’s partner countries, including those outside the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy and the pre-accession programmes. That is a crucial point. For example, the Union takes decisions that have a direct impact on its ACP partners’ economy. I need not remind Commissioner Michel that this happened recently in the case of the reform of the COM in sugar, which forced those countries radically to diversify their industrial activities. The ETF could have made a useful contribution to that development and can do so in future in similar cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The second benefit of the compromise, to which I attach special importance, is that it genuinely involves MEPs in reviewing the Foundation’s activities. That question, however, goes beyond the framework of this agency. Parliament has only one opportunity, often very brief, to look at the way the agencies operate, during the budget and budget discharge votes. In my view, it is no longer possible, especially with the forthcoming entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, for Parliament not to be more seriously involved in the matters with which the agencies deal. That is why, in the specific case of this Foundation, Parliament will henceforth nominate three representatives, without the right to vote, true, but three representatives on the Governing Board, provided they are particularly skilled in the Foundation’s areas of activity. Parliament is free to appoint either external figures or MEPs. It will be up to it to take a responsible decision as to the choice of level of representation on the Governing Board. The main point at this stage is that henceforth the choice is available and that the debate on Parliament’s involvement is launched.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the growing number of agencies, it is imperative for all the European institutions to take a close look at the means of monitoring their activities. In that context, I am convinced that we must create a real link between Parliament and the agencies. Similarly, the new regulation aims to formalise the hearings of the Director of the Foundation before the parliamentary committees. For several years now, that Director has appeared before Parliament once a year at the invitation of the Committee on Employment, but that invitation was not formalised in the past. Lastly, the Governing Board will appoint the Director for a period of five years, on the basis of a list of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission; before being appointed the candidate selected by the Governing Board will have to make a statement before the European Parliament’s competent committees and answer questions put by members of those committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest. On the subject of Parliament’s involvement the compromise we have reached is rather less than what I would have hoped. But we have to look things in the face. As the debate stands now, people are not yet ready to go any further. So it is reasonable to support the negotiated package so that the Foundation can function as soon as possible on solid bases.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask Members to adopt Compromise Amendment No 11, which is the result of the trilogue Commissioner Michel mentioned a moment ago, to adopt it in its entirety and not give in to the temptation of an amendment that would upset the balance we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Slovenian Presidency and the Commission for the quality of our dialogue on these matters and, of course, I thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In committee and in the trialogue we reached a compromise for the Foundation in Turin, which is to be put on an entirely new footing by virtue of the new regulation. Our main objective in refocusing the Turin-based agency is to strengthen relations between the Foundation and the European Parliament and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the Foundation. This Parliament attaches high priority to the promotion of vocational training in Europe, and we believe that we should no longer merely assess the work of the Foundation on an <span class="italic">ex post </span>basis, as a kind of auditing body, but that we should have a specific upstream part to play in the process of determining the content and shape of its programmes and that we should be able to contribute our opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we attach great importance to two points. The first of these is the composition of the Governing Board, and the second is the procedure for appointing the Director of the Foundation. On the latter point we arrived at a sound solution in committee on the basis of a PPE-DE proposal. As the rapporteur said, under Article 10 of the new regulation, the Director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission. Before being appointed, the candidates are to appear before the competent committee or committees of the European Parliament to make a statement and answer questions.</p>
<p class="contents">A more difficult issue, and one which has not been resolved to the satisfaction of my group in the present compromise, concerns the composition of the Governing Board. The arrangement set out in the proposed Article 7, whereby Parliament can appoint three non-voting representatives, is inexpedient. We want the chance to be efficient players in the Board's decision-making processes and not mere embellishments. We therefore consider it essential that Parliament should be able to send three specialised representatives to serve on the Board, and it goes without saying that they must have the same voting rights as all the other Board members.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that the Governing Board operates efficiently, we believe it is essential to limit the number of its members. We do not see any compelling need for every Member State of the EU to send a representative. Instead, we should make do with representatives from two thirds of the Member States, applying the rotation rules prescribed by the Treaty of Lisbon. With three representatives each from the Commission, Parliament and the partner countries, the Member States would still be preponderant. After all, a governing board is not a meeting of shareholders but is supposed to represent the body of shareholders in day-to-day decision-making and to take rapid decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">May I therefore appeal once again to the Council – whose representative, unfortunately, is not in attendance – to reconsider its position. For the sake of operational efficiency, I ask the House to support our Amendment 10. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we have been through some tough negotiations with the Council, but I believe that we have arrived at a good compromise proposal. Although the work of this foundation is aimed at countries that are not members of the EU and have therefore not adopted the Lisbon objectives, it is nonetheless meaningful to talk about the objectives in this context. After all, the Lisbon objectives are in reality just a way of achieving progress and growth, and one does not need to be a member of the EU to wish for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Education is one of the factors underpinning growth and development within the EU. Investing in better education can help to ensure that we in the EU achieve the Lisbon objectives and together make Europe a better place in which to live. Another important tool for achieving the Lisbon objectives is flexicurity in the labour market, and education and flexicurity are very closely linked. Through education a better and more competitive workforce is created, which in turn enables stronger growth to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we consider the future of the EU from a long-term aspect. Therefore, the European Training Foundation is an extremely important agency. The EU must not be a closed club. It is important that we help potential new Member States as much as we can. We must of course require new Member States to meet certain requirements and standards, but we must also help them to do this. I believe that the new structure that we have introduced for the Foundation in Torino is a major advantage for future challenges and I believe that the Foundation can help potential new Member States to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that the Foundation’s new structure reinforces the link between the European Parliament and the Foundation. We are gaining the opportunity to appoint three experts to the board. This shows that the Council has begun to accept that the European Parliament must also have more influence in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully share his opinion concerning the extended geographical mandate of the European Training Foundation (ETF).</p>
<p class="contents">That agency, which works as an instrument of EU external policy, has the potential to respond fully to challenges addressed by territories like Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The rich experience that the ETF has acquired over the years could now be channelled towards areas that desperately need vocational training in order to improve access to learning and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the countries in the ACP area are currently facing remarkable economic reforms, and in order to be successful need human resources. The ETF should have the mandate and the resources to respond to such demands. I would go even further and say that when enlarging the mandate of the ETF, we should plan to have temporary liaison offices in areas where the activities of the agencies are concentrated. Such offices would allow the ETF to better organise its activities and would give more visibility to its actions in third countries. I fully agree with the proposal of the rapporteur that more transparency is needed, and I fully share his suggestion to add MEPs to the governing board of the agency.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I consider that when it comes to human resources, the European Union should take a broader approach. We want to set up the ‘blue card’ procedure that allows skilled workers from abroad to work legally in Europe, with the EU probably contributing to the training of those skilled workers. However, as I have already said, skilled workers are also badly needed in their own countries if there is to be a genuine development of those regions. The role of the European Training Foundation will therefore be essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The work of the agencies and foundations is often regarded as nothing more than a cost factor. I firmly believe that what our Foundation in Turin is doing constitutes very useful neighbourhood aid, whether it be in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe or in North Africa. The practical assistance that the ETF gives our partner countries in the development and creation of high-quality training systems can scarcely be prized highly enough. May I therefore express my thanks and appreciation to its senior management.</p>
<p class="contents">I must address some frank words of criticism to the Council, whose negotiating tactics, following the achievement of consensus in the first round, involved topping up the Council representation to 27 and then initially failing to understand why we in Parliament also wished to be represented on the Board and then, finally, agreeing to three specialised representatives, but as non-voting members. The Council's attitude was simply incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only repeat that the uptight, defensive attitude of the Council Presidency is beyond me. It is further proof of the difficulties encountered by the governments of our Member States when it comes to gauging the importance they should attach to the European Parliament, the only democratically elected institution of the Union.</p>

The EU has no competence over education, at least not until the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, and that depends on the Irish referendum. Is the result of that a foregone conclusion, or will a ‘no’ vote there be just swept aside like the French and Dutch referendums?</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, what kind of structure will this training foundation have? I see that our proposal is for it to be run variously by six representatives from Member States, plus six from the Commission and only three from Parliament, or that plus representatives from partner countries appointed by the Commission. In the latter case, responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not Member States, giving the unelected Commission a major say. Hardly democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 7 suggests that the Commission would submit candidates for the directorship of the ETF, and this causes concern in many quarters. It has resulted in further suggestions as to the make-up of the ETF board, right up to an unworkable one representative for each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">To have so many counter-suggestions for the composition of the board of the ETF is not exactly the best of starts, but that begs the question: Why does anyone think we need such a foundation? I would argue that a training foundation is not only unnecessary, it will be counterproductive. If you care to look round the countries of Europe as opposed to the EU, you will find training programmes of all sorts scattered around. There are different standards but, between them, they develop many skills, which is why Europe has such a rich heritage. You see, each country has always produced its artists, composers, authors and so on. Even the small countries come up with, for example, composers of world renown. Each country produces its leaders and experts, its technicians, bankers, sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a multiplicity of skills, with each country contributing in its own way. If we try to put all that together in a European Training Foundation it would drain the life out of the training schemes in many countries. A single ETF will not have the intrinsic qualities of national flavour. We need variety, not a harmonised one-track theme.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we will lose more than we gain with such a scheme. Please forget it and let the countries of Europe make their contributions to the whole. That might even generate enthusiasm for the EU project, for that is sadly lacking, judging by the ‘no’ votes of two founding states and the continuous efforts being made to sell the EU to its peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me begin by thanking Bernard Lehideux for his excellent work, for excellent contacts with the President and coordinators during the process and for enabling us to achieve a settlement on first reading. I also want to thank the representatives of the European Training Foundation for their input, an important contribution providing many further links. Education, vocational training and lifelong learning are increasingly important. They are important in the EU, but also in the partnership countries. There is a need for cooperation between Cedefop and the European Training Foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a new Regulation contains some elements which make for improvements. To begin with, the remit is broadened to include lifelong learning instead of focusing solely on vocational training. This is a concept which we increasingly draw upon and which is important in our policy. Secondly, the number of countries is increasing, as Mr Lehideux said. They include all the partnership countries, not just those included in the neighbourhood and pre-accession programmes, but all partnership countries. Thirdly, relations with Parliament are strengthened. We have enjoyed good cooperation which can now be developed through the new Regulation. I think that we have arrived at a good settlement, both as regards the way we appoint the Director of the Foundation but also as regards the fact that we can appoint three experts without voting rights on the Governing Board. We did not get all we wanted, but it is still a good compromise which bodes well for the future. It is a good basic position. We can develop lifelong learning as a cooperative process between Parliament and the foundations working on these matters. That is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously I also support it because I believe it really is a big step forward. I can already see and envisage new prospects that – whatever some may say – are opening here and I am therefore delighted that we will no doubt achieve a broad consensus on this proposal. Let me reply to two objections that were put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Amendment 10 to Article 7: I would just remind Mrs Stauner that there is a risk of conflict of interest, since Parliament is the authority that gives the budget discharge. Legally, at least, there would clearly be a conflict of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it is sensible to separate the powers. I was a parliamentarian for many years and I never claimed any responsibilities beyond those due to parliamentarians. The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is not to govern, I am sorry to say. The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is to scrutinise and to make laws, and of course to monitor governments or executives. I do not, therefore, understand that shift in emphasis that some people seem to find normal. I am speaking for myself, but we are holding a parliamentary debate and I believe for Parliament to confuse its monitoring task with a governing task, which is incompatible with its role, would detract from its fundamental task. That is how a parliament can be destroyed. For a parliament to want to become a kind of governing assembly would not be compatible with the high principle of democracy. I am saying that because I do believe the separation of powers is important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the compromise reached is the most effective one, primarily because it ensures Parliament’s independence in carrying out its monitoring function.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit I am often taken aback by some of the views expressed, but then that is what we are here for. I believe it was Mr Clark who said the Commission was exceeding its competences and that the European Training Foundation could be counterproductive. That is quite contrary to reality, experience and totally independent evaluations of the remarkable work done by the Foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner responsible for development, I can already foresee – thanks to the main amendment, which will no doubt be adopted – the prospects of effectiveness, the positive prospects that will be offered, especially, as some speakers suggested, in countries within my remit where vocational training is a crucial factor. I am thinking, for example, of the centre for migration management and information in Mali, a pilot project we will soon be starting up. I can imagine what a useful role the Foundation could play there.</p>
<p class="contents">So I can only welcome the outcome, and I totally reject the criticism that it is counterproductive. Clearly, people cannot change their nature: those who do not like Europe say exaggerated things and that – let me say with all due respect to the Member concerned – is exaggerated; it is therefore totally meaningless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One point obviously remains to be settled and I want to make an observation about it: it is the EPP’s Amendment 10. Dialogue between the European institutions is absolutely vital. That dialogue took place. My colleague Mr Kusstatscher says that the Council's attitude during that dialogue was not exactly what we might have expected. He is right, but in the end we had the trilogue, we had several meetings, and at the end of those meetings we signalled our agreement. I do not believe dialogue between our institutions is possible if, after giving our agreement, we take it back a few days later by tabling an amendment. So, we debated, we were not entirely in agreement about everything, everyone took a step towards rapprochement with others and we ended up by achieving a compromise text.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the groups, all the groups, to accept the idea that we show solidarity in the decision we have taken, in the agreement we gave to the Council and the Commission at the end of the trilogue and I ask them to reflect that solidarity in their votes. When one asks for change one must also know how far one can go. I said a while ago that I would have preferred to go a bit further, but that I did not believe everybody was ready for that yet in their minds. As rapporteur for this document, having obtained a great deal and been supported in my work by my colleagues, I would ask them to continue to show solidarity regarding our compromise agreement until it is time to vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unlike the earlier Monterrey Declarations, the Paris Declaration established clear objectives, translated into twelve actions and indicators, in fact a major step forward. In December this year in Accra, an initial assessment is to be made of what has become of all those fine promises.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that in recent years the European Commission has made great efforts to implement the new aid agenda. It can be proud of what it has achieved in terms of division of labour, better coordination and respect for the local contribution. In 2006, at the instigation of Commissioner Michel, it even went a little further than the undertakings in Paris and approved an ambitious plan of action and the concept of division of labour and results-based management. However, there is still work to be done. Many intentions still have to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, aid is still not sufficiently geared to national systems and too many different payment systems are still involved. As regards the uncoupling of aid, we are hardly getting anywhere. Technical cooperation is still too donor-controlled. The Donor Atlas urgently needs to be updated and extended, and then mainly focused on the most neglected countries and sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, approval of the code of conduct for the division of labour is problematic. Firstly because the Member States do not fulfil their promises. The Member States are lagging behind, both in scope and efficiency. For the first time since 2000, the percentage spent on official aid has fallen, from 0.41% in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007. There needs to be a radical change of course in order to achieve the Millennium Goals. If the Council wants to retain its credibility, it has to confirm its promises as a matter of urgency. The Member States must commit themselves to a time path for the quantity and also the quality of the help. Quantity and quality are actually inextricably linked.</p>
<p class="contents">The great challenge of qualitative reform is and remains reinforcing own contributions and mutual accountability. However, that requires a regular dialogue with the social midfield, local governments and above all with parliaments. Greater transparency is absolutely vital. More budgetary support requires efficient parliamentary scrutiny of all funds promised and paid. That is why this report argues in favour of adding a thirteenth indicator to the Paris Agenda. If the role of European and African parliaments in ensuring greater efficiency is so important, why not translate that into an extra indicator?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the biggest donor the Union must assume its responsibilities in Accra. It must, first and foremost, set its own house in order. Only then can it credibly take the lead in Accra and put forward an ambitious plan. The Union has not only the expertise but also the ability to become the most efficient donor. What is needed now is for promises to be turned into action on the ground. That is the essence of this report, for which I venture to ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also delighted to find that we have exactly the same approach and are fighting to achieve the same results.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the next six months will be vitally important in terms of testing the European Union’s real resolve to make concrete progress on the three main pillars of development policy: firstly, achieving the Millennium Goals; secondly, increasing aid volumes; thirdly, improving aid effectiveness. The Accra meeting in September will test the credibility of the entire process and all the players involved. Either the process will really take off, or it will be bogged down forever.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is, therefore, very important in that it can pass on a strong message to the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week. That Council will discuss the Commission’s proposals in relation to the objectives. I hope that in its turn that Council will send out a message that is just as ambitious as the one contained in Mr Van Hecke’s report. By acting together, we Europeans made a difference in Paris in 2005. We must be equally ambitious today and ensure that in Accra we move on from rhetoric to action on all our commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard too many voices in our Member States that want to turn Accra and this debate into a technical debate about feasibility, effectiveness, and so forth. It is not a technical debate. Accra is not a technical meeting. It is a political meeting, at which we will find out whether the Member States have the political will to meet their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The battle is far from won. The Commission cannot act alone. That is why I am calling on you to mobilise all your resources and contacts to ensure that this summit proves a real success. The burden of proof now lies in the camp of the Member States and of non-European backers. An alliance between Parliament and the Commission is, therefore, vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat what is written in the report. I agree almost 100% with it. We need concrete progress in important areas, of which I will cite just a few. The first is aid predictability. I am most grateful for Parliament’s support for MDG contracting. That is one of the proposals I will be putting on the table in Accra. Of course the partner countries will have to play their part in this contract and, obviously, we will have to set up monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of making greater use of partner countries’ procedures. That is why I have said that in countries where that is possible budgetary aid should be the main instrument for channelling aid. It is interesting to note – and I believe it is important for you to remember the figures I am going to quote – that to date Tanzania has had to produce some 2 400 reports for the various donors and, listen carefully, more than 8 000 audit reports for the multilateral development banks. You must admit that is flabbergasting and poses a real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly emphasises the need for increased transparency and responsibility in development aid, although obviously that is impossible with such a jungle of reports. It can be done only if we strengthen parliamentary oversight in relation to development financing and its inclusion in the national budget, as the rapporteur said. We must encourage ‘democratic ownership’ and we will support partner countries in their endeavours to strengthen that ownership and oversight. Obviously, parliaments and civil society play a key role here.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the division of labour. The code of conduct must become reality. Another example: in Mali, 26 donors are involved in rural development, while in Burkina, five donors are involved in half of all the country’s sectors and half of all donors are involved in one third of all the sectors. So that is where the margins for improvement lie in the various countries, in terms of effectiveness, and I would really like to have Parliament’s support in trying to convince the Member States of the need for a better division of labour. That would bring a quite colossal improvement in aid effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point concerns situations of fragility. An example is that in 2006, 65% of the aid granted to Ivory Coast, Liberia and the Central African Republic came from only three bilateral donors. There again we have already proposed pilot countries involving the largest number of Member States. In procedural terms, I have called for the Commission to be as flexible as it can under current rules so as to improve our ability to react. Having said that, we must not forget that the aid effectiveness issue is not the exclusive preserve of the donors; on the contrary, it must also be the cornerstone of the partner countries’ action and be central to our dialogue with them. Only the partner countries are in a position to force us to provide more effective aid by actively defining not only their development objectives but also the means of achieving them. That is the only way our dialogue can progress on a basis of partnership founded on equal rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a last point before concluding. Parliament is asking the Commission to give the delegations adequate room for action. You are quite right! We are trying to do so by means of our decentralisation process. We ask a lot of our delegations. As you know, resources are limited and, in the end, the capacity to use our delegations also depends on the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would ask you to help us convince our Member States – something Mr Van Hecke also brought up – that they have a moral duty, an imperative obligation, to respect the commitments they made in 2005 regarding the amount of aid they allocate. You know that 2007 is a year to be forgotten as quickly as possible because certain countries did not honour their commitments, which eclipsed the good behaviour of others who, for their part, showed they were able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we will propose, firstly, that they reiterate their 2005 commitment and, secondly, present an agenda, a road map, a phased plan showing how they will achieve the objectives to which they subscribed. As I said at the beginning, we have not won the day yet, because according to my information preliminary meetings indicate that some Member States might even be prepared to refuse to reiterate their 2005 undertakings, which is of course unacceptable, while others would clearly not be prepared to plan in phases either. I therefore need your strength of conviction and, if I may call it that, your capacity for cheek, to make everyone face up to their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it deals with the European Commission’s responsibility to manage properly the funds of the EU’s citizens. Secondly, it draws our attention to the need for better structuring of development programmes. Finally, it calls for the political courage to monitor the budget and fight against its misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate my fellow Member Mr Van Hecke on the report, which underlines the Union’s dual responsibility: both external and internal. If we want to be a credible player in our external relations, we have to provide the developing countries with as much finance as we have promised, and to distribute it as we said we would. We all know how difficult it is to judge whether or not financial aid has been used in an effective manner. Often the political and cultural circumstances in developing countries force the donors to adopt a creative and flexible budgetary approach. In spite of that, creativity and flexibility must not interfere with the need for transparency and honesty.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be honest if we admit that European public funds often do not bear the expected fruit, and if we stop their potential misuse. In order to be able to prove that development aid has been effective, we should obtain the recipient’s signature confirming that the project has really been operational in the long run. I must say that the most important responsibility of the European Commission and of the European Parliament is the internal responsibility to be honest to the citizens of Europe. The European Union finances development assistance from our taxes, and we know very little about its effectiveness. I congratulate my fellow Member Mr Bösch who recently criticised the way in which the European Union distributes development aid provided by the taxpayers’ money. Aid effectiveness is not only a necessary budgetary exercise; it is also a test of the political courage to point out that the taxpayers’ money must be used in an effective manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That crisis is a brutal reminder that if we cannot ensure the most elementary right, the right to life and to enough food, our efforts in the area of development aid will be in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Van Hecke, whose work I applaud, points out that a long-term strategy is the only way to give real support to the development of our partner countries. In regard to food as to public health and education, we need lasting solutions if we are to respond to the deep-rooted causes of the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The many amendments tabled by the PSE give support to the rapporteur’s position and strengthen it in some respects. We pointed out that our priority objective must be to achieve the Millennium Goals, the first of which is to eradicate poverty and hunger. To that end, and to render the aid more effective, it must be more locally owned, as close to home as possible and to the needs of the local population. That is why I pointed to the need for greater consultation with national parliaments, civil society and local authorities in regard to formulating, implementing and evaluating development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is essential that we effectively combat corruption and make the aid more transparent. In concrete terms, we are asking the Commission to produce a matrix of all the funds allocated to local governance in order to check the coherence of the policies and the sound management of those funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because a debate on improving aid effectiveness cannot be dissociated from the question of the amount of the aid, let me again – as was done a moment ago – point to and condemn the unjustifiable reduction in public development aid between 2006 and 2007, when it fell from 0.41% to 0.38% in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Accra summit will indeed be political, as the Commissioner said. It will offer the donor countries a unique opportunity to reiterate their commitment. It is up to us to be at that meeting and not to disappoint our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I endorse fully paragraph 1 of the report. However, the Member States and the Commission can only make their actions more harmonised, transparent, predictable and collectively effective if they pool resources under a single institution responsible for development aid. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid effectiveness is in our own hands, as quite often we spend far too much on the administration in charge of responsible use of development aid in target countries. We should save, for example, on staff training, administration and expenses so that more development aid actually reaches the recipients.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment there is no proper coordination between the Member States concerning the allocation of their funds. According to the principle of subsidiarity the executive power ought to reside at the lowest feasible level unless designation of power to a higher level presents considerable advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no universal solution to the problem of low aid effectiveness but one step should be serious and swift changes to the administration framework through further centralisation, as we are continuously losing time and human lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is excellent that agreement has been reached regarding the content, and that EU aid will be both increased and improved. Aid must be aid. We must not dilute it by using it for other purposes, such as debt cancellation, where money is simply moved from one post to another in the donor countries. This money must be used for those who need it, and we must be able to see that it is being used for that purpose. It is, of course, the only way to get Europeans to increase the growth in aid – they must be able to see that it is effective, as Jeffrey Sachs said so clearly recently. It is therefore important that Amendment 1 is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid must also continue to increase up to 2015, as we have promised on an incredible number of occasions. It is petty-minded and embarrassing that the EU aid decreased between 2006 and 2007. Without more money, aid cannot possibly be effective enough. We will not achieve the goals unless we live up to our many promises.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be nice if the European Parliament could grasp the EU’s agricultural policy. There are many analyses from the World Bank, the IMF, the UN and others that document the fact that the common agricultural policy is undermining the opportunities open to developing countries to grow, and here I am not talking about export subsidies, which are grotesque enough but only account for a small fraction of the destruction being caused by this policy. As the situation now stands, we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other – sometimes taking away a little more than we have given. We cannot then wait for the United States to withdraw its agricultural support. US agricultural support is worse than ours, and the EU should lead by example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sub-Saharan Africa receives more international aid than any other region in the world yet poverty levels remain stubbornly high. Studies have shown that aid can and has been successful in reducing poverty in countries with sound economic management and government institutions. If allocated properly, aid has the potential to help millions of people escape a hand-to-mouth existence.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reality is that corruption does exist in many developing countries and, while we must continue to promote good governance in these countries, we have a more pressing responsibility to help the many millions of people dying of starvation and disease in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must deliver on the commitments we have made to the Millennium Development Goals. How can we turn a blind eye to the three billion people living on the equivalent of three dollars a day or the five million children in Africa who died last year before they reached the age of five?</p>
<p class="contents">And yes, we do have a responsibility to the European taxpayers to ensure that their money reaches the most needy and is spent effectively. In this regard I believe that Europe should look at more targeted programmes, such as the Global Fund, which combats AIDS, TB and malaria, the world’s most devastating diseases, which kill over six million people per year. The Global Fund has been a highly effective organisation with minimum bureaucracy and maximum impact. It represents an innovative approach to international health financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Global poverty is predominantly a rural problem. Three quarters of the extremely poor people in developing countries live in rural areas. If we are to weather the storm of climate change and increasing food prices, we must improve agricultural production by targeting agriculture-specific programmes as they can have a powerful impact on poverty reduction. The presentation that Professor Jeffrey Sachs made to the committee recently was a great example of how that money can be targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the World Development Report last year, GDP growth generated by agriculture is four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. Instead of shipping food aid to Third World countries, Europe needs to lead the way to help African farmers grow more food by providing small farmers with proper seeds, fertilisers and water management technologies. But of course there are many other ways and, as the Commissioner said, many of these need to be country-specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is running out for Africa. We need to learn the lessons from the past so we can save future generations from disease and starvation. I believe Accra is a political opportunity and I support what other speakers have said on that. It is not just a technical meeting to look at technical areas, it is a political opportunity. We have to see if we can get real take-off on fighting poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made many many commitments; some of those commitments are not forthcoming. We are halfway through the Millennium Development Goals time-frame and it is time that we really pushed to try and deliver on all of these. We have to get aid back on track. We must work with African governments; we must fight corruption; we must improve governance and we have to deliver to the world’s poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recommendations contained in Mr Van Hecke’s excellent report, which I fully endorse, certainly go in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are debating this report, Brussels is witnessing the presentation of the new annual report of CONCORD, the European confederation of development NGOs, on the aid commitments given by EU governments. The report examines the progress made by each Member State, and the picture which emerges is one of gaps and contradictions in our policies to combat poverty and increase aid effectiveness. For example, as Commissioner Michel was telling me, the report notes that in 2007 the amount of aid given by the 27 did not increase as it should have done, but actually fell. At the same time the report shows that many of the problems associated with development policies still persist, such as the lack of transparency of linked aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We should respect commitments given at international level. We cannot dash the expectations of people in the southern countries of the world, nor those of people in the so-called northern countries who are working with such commitment to ensure that injustice, poverty and the food crisis, to which Mr Schapira just referred, are handled decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner: we need to stop the rhetoric and take action. I would also like to thank Mr Michel for his passion, his commitment and his fortitude. With the two conferences in Accra and Doha, 2008 can and should be a real turning point and offers an outstanding opportunity for the European Union to show that it can shoulder its responsibilities as leading world donor. It seems almost superfluous to say that we need to increase the quantity and quality of aid. These are not two conflicting concepts. We must not use the need to make aid more effective as an excuse for giving less of it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, everyone is now aware that simply increasing the quantity of aid is not enough. It is vital, as we have all been saying, to have an objective for the fight against poverty, instead of geopolitical and strategic objectives. As we are always saying, commercial, migration and security policies must be consistent with development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">European cooperation needs to be based not only on our own interests, but also on the genuine priorities of southern countries as identified by local governments, and also by parliaments and civil society, and it is also essential to increase the transparency and accountability of EU aid programmes. In this context, Parliament should be put in a position to exercise genuine democratic control and I welcome the Commissioner’s call to work hard to ensure that EU countries stand by their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few questions regarding calls for proposals. Those NGOs which want to participate in the Commission tendering procedures find that they are too long and cumbersome, which makes their activities really difficult and in fact excludes many small local associations. So why not ask these organisations directly how to streamline procedures? I have submitted an amendment to be voted today with this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the matter of the untying of aid which is dealt with in the Van Hecke report. Progress has been made, but all aid needs to be untied completely in order to prevent money returning to donor countries instead of relieving poverty in beneficiary countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to pinpoint those States which are still overstating their public development aid figures. In 2007, EU countries spent around EUR 8 billion, in other words about 17% of total European aid, in important sectors but not in the development sector. Cancellation of debt, expenditure on refugees, grants for foreign students constitute expenditure which should be excluded from development aid figures; and so I invite you to support the relevant amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I too have high hopes for 2008 and for the commitments to reverse the trend; I agree wholeheartedly with the Commissioner when he talks of shared responsibility between donors and countries where everyone has to play a part: rights and obligations. That is our strength! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That, Madam President, is what we can conclude from the extremely balanced report by the rapporteur. I congratulate him. The report has come at the right time. Europe seems to be getting tired of development expenditure. That trend is very worrying and we should not underestimate it. Even in countries such as the Netherlands, which have always been known for their international solidarity, voices are heard in favour of cutting development expenditure. The only answer is for the work to be transparent, efficient and results-based.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can achieve a great deal on that point, especially through the three Cs: coherence, complementarity and coordination. The Commissioner has often pointed that out and is working towards it. We can also do more about the proliferation of projects and programmes. If something is not going well, another programme is not always the best solution. It is better for us to do a couple of things well than to half-do everything.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the European Union is the biggest donor. So we have a big responsibility. Besides that, with the new Treaty our possibilities for more cohesion, additional policy and better coordination are growing. The effectiveness of our aid is crucial, not just to justify the developing countries at home, but above all actually to be able to combat poverty in the developing countries. In the end it is the result that counts more than the intention. In the 2009 development cooperation budget, I shall be putting forward proposals for evaluation to be more results-based as well. We must focus more on results than on vague indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask Commissioner Michel the following question. Commissioner Fischer Boel said that the Commission wanted to use some of the unspent money from the 2008 European Budget to help countries affected by the sharp rise in food prices, in other words for the food crisis. I should like to know the reaction of the Commissioner. Can the Commissioner also say how these extra funds will be used? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we continue along that road, between 2005 and 2010 the European Union will have granted billions of aid less than it had pledged. That is a significant step backwards in the pursuit of the goal of devoting 0.7% to development but also – and that is very important – in the pursuit of the Millennium Goals and, more generally, in the battle we say we want to wage against poverty in the world.</p>

In fact the reverse is true, since everybody agrees today that additional resources will be needed on top of the pledged amounts if we are to meet the many commitments we have entered into and those we will, no doubt, still have to take on. Aid effectiveness is, therefore, essential, because more effective aid also means more aid. Everyone must realise that.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, let me point out that, as ever, it is time we made very concrete progress in applying innovatory financing instruments to development aid, something that was mentioned expressly in the Paris Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted our report also to refer to the role of the diaspora in development cooperation. The European Union is still far too nervous about this, although it would benefit so much from greater and closer cooperation with our fellow citizens from partner countries who are resident in the EU. That would be another means of integrating rather than excluding a great many people and it is a message close to my heart at a time when some Europeans are adopting positions that are astonishing, measures that are shocking.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I want to point out that, as the Commissioner has often said, aid will never be really effective until there is real coherence between the various EU policies and until aid is no longer guided by policies that have nothing to do with development. Current events show that we do not yet have that coherence everywhere. This situation will continue so long as the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, which is the relevant authority, continues to apply an extremely broad definition of development cooperation. That is another condition for improving our aid effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago I presented a first report on aid effectiveness in this very Chamber. Where are we now, after all those endlessly repeated words? At any rate, the Commissioner can count on the socialists to carry on with our common struggle to improve aid effectiveness for the sake of the poorest people of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once upon a time I went into politics to see to it that my country, Sweden, would achieve the ‘one per cent target’. The Liberal Party of Sweden – my party in the national context – is and has always been a driving force in this action, and Sweden actually achieves the target.</p>
<p class="contents">Now nearly 40 years on, however, I have to recognise that there have been many disappointments. Maladministration, corruption and failed projects have unfortunately been common. But development has often also proceeded in the right direction. Millions of people the world over have been given better lives and many democracies have been established. There is indeed room for optimism. But if legitimacy and support among the EU population are to continue to be strong, we must improve our ability to act fast and effectively. Aid must be deployed in a way which guarantees quality and long-range benefit so that we can attain the millennium goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, aid policy must be formulated more from the bottom up. Those countries which receive aid must be entrusted with greater responsibility for what we might call the problem-stating prerogative in aid work. There are plenty of indications, according to the Commission, to show that poor countries are forced to create more expensive bureaucracy in order to facilitate the administration which is a condition for the aid money to be disbursed. That was not the intention! It is also very important to talk more about how we should coordinate aid efforts. Another perspective which can and must not be forgotten is the important role of women in combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">To criticise how the requirements are formulated today does not mean that we need not oppose the imposition of conditions for the aid. Listening to what people on the ground have to say also implies that we should venture to consider classifying certain military contributions as aid, since peacekeeping operations can be vital. Take the situation in Chad, for example, where refugees need protection just as much as shipments of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I want to address the sensitive question of our agricultural policy, which Mrs Auken mentioned. In the report, the Commission and the Member States are urged to support any measures which can contribute to stabilising raw material prices for the developing countries. Here I have a suggestion in line with what Margrete Auken was saying: an effective, but perhaps also bitter medicine – scrap the EU’s agricultural policy! Indeed the Commission has already made a start on that, which is to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the Commission is working hard and taking measures to ensure aid arrives at its destination, we cannot make progress if Member States do not contribute what they have promised.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that both donors and partner countries are responsible for aid being more effective, but our greatest responsibility is to ensure that aid really contributes to helping developing countries meet the major challenges they face.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that we fulfil our part of the bargain and that we do not have to feel ashamed because we are not doing what we promised to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Ideally, aid has a positive effect on development and good governance, but aid can also do a lot of harm if it is not distributed properly. Developing countries must therefore take responsibility for implementing their own policies and we donors must respect that, give them our support and provide the space necessary for that to happen, rather than fund our own priorities as some donors do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress the need to ensure the coherence of our own policies.</p>
<p class="contents">All development efforts are a waste of time if the objectives of trade, monetary and other policies undermine or contradict them.</p>

The report is comprehensive, wide-ranging and exhaustive. I must admit that, reading the report, I lost sight of even the most important objective. However, the rapporteur clearly stated this objective and the main purpose of the report in his presentation at the start of our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I decided to speak because some new issues have come up in the last few years. Climate change has had a dramatic impact on some developing countries. What is important is that, when we provide aid, we should emphasise the fact that we are doing this now because the European Union recognises that the threat posed by climate change is a challenge to our civilisation as well as being civilisation’s responsibility. We should, therefore, in the light of the risks of global warming, significantly increase funding, and strengthen the actions of donors. Such a standpoint and such activities will demonstrate the nature of our strategy as regards the EU priority of ‘combating climate change’. We should also direct our assistance to renewable sources of energy in developing countries (of course fighting hunger is the most important, but I am talking here about additional funds), as well as for overcoming the direct effects of global warming, for adaptation measures associated for example with coastal flooding, soil salinisation and a level of floods and droughts that was previously unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that our objective, and the political priority for the European Union, are to achieve a global agreement on combating global warming. Negotiations will take place in Poznan in 2008 and Copenhagen in 2009. If we need to convince other countries, we must reduce emissions and develop new technologies within the EU and provide special assistance to developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Probably the first condition for ensuring increased effectiveness is to plan a fixed and binding schedule for aid flows. It is very difficult to make something effective if there is not a minimum of certainty about what resources are going to be available.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality also depends on quantity and, like my colleages, I deplore the fall in resouces allocated by European countries to development aid. I hope you do not mind me saying so but there is one notable exception, and that is my country, Spain, which now comes top after increasing development aid by 33% last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we have an opportunity in Accra and we must do all we can to make sure that 20% of aid is used for education, health, access to water and basic sanitation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to assure you of the Committee on Development’s support for your attempts to coordinate the different actors. There are only a few resources and, as you have often said yourself, they have to be divided between many actors, and this process of dilution reduces effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out, as does the report, the need to simplify the procedures for granting aid. We find the same problem wherever we go: there is no doubt that the time taken between when we say we are going to do something and the time when it gets done undermines any attempt to promote the effective management of resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report notes that the approach to development aid needs to be reformed. I can only agree, and stress that this reform should start with a re-think from the roots – namely development policy – upwards. I strongly believe that aid should no longer be limited to help, support or assistance. We should change our mindset and see our contribution to developing countries as investment in the broadest sense of the word. It should be an investment that we undertake on a long-term basis, not just for ensuring the survival of those countries, but also for their real development as functional economies and democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">While investing, we also need to touch on core issues that could bring a real end to poverty. A couple of weeks ago, during his visit to Parliament, Professor Geoffrey Sachs underlined how much influence, in positive terms, the use of unexploited land in Africa would have on food prices. Instead of providing food supplies to Africa, we should transfer agricultural know-how so that the continent can feed its own population and, in a positive scenario, even provide food at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply concerned by another issue underlined in this report: the programming of money flow towards recipient countries. From my experience, projects cannot achieve their goals if resources do not come in time and if they are less than the amount initially planned. That is where the European Union can fail badly. In 2007 the level of EU aid decreased. Many projects were affected and their goals could not be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, development education and raising the awareness of our own citizens on this subject should be considered a priority. We, as Members of this Parliament, have an essential role to play in that respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, life is not that simple. There are many social and economic problems that cannot be resolved immediately just by giving more money. Of course money helps the process of solving problems, but funds are not the only issue for success in development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A second very important issue is aid effectiveness. Poorly organised assistance can lead to dependence or, as some people say, the modernisation of dependence. Effectiveness of aid is just as important for recipients as it is for those granting the aid. For recipients of aid, because, after all, money is not an aim in itself, its purpose is to change reality and to hasten the achievement of the Millennium Goals. It is easy to spend money, the trick is to spend it sensibly.</p>
<p class="contents">For donors, on the other hand, effectiveness is important, because they have to show taxpayers that development expenditure is being spent wisely. Thus these two processes, an increase in development expenditure and an increase in the quality of this expenditure, are not contradictory and can be achieved simultaneously.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke has prepared an excellent report for which he deserves our thanks. I hope that, with this report, the representatives of the European Union at the High Level Forum in Accra will have a clear and unequivocal standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that a particularly important responsibility for the European Union in this regard should be continued harmonisation of assistance for Member States and the EU. This is important because this issue is exclusively up to us. Coordination inside the EU does not depend on our international partners, nor on those to whom we provide aid and the costs of uncoordinated aid are very high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To improve the effectiveness of European aid it is essential to invest in human and financial capacity and to overcome the inconsistencies between policies and the institutional architecture. The Lisbon Treaty opens up an opportunity by creating the European External Action Service. Besides supporting the future High Representative, this service must be equipped to carry EU development policy forward in parallel to CFSP and ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel to guarantee aid effectiveness. It is dependent on fulfilling promises already made. As Commissioner Michel has stressed, the Member States must increase public development aid to the levels promised in 2005 without inflating them by writing off debts, and must effectively direct it towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in an era in which rising oil and food prices make combating poverty in the world an even more urgent matter.</p>

A few weeks ago I visited the IMF and the World Bank on behalf of the Committee on Development and at that meeting I asked what the world would be like between 2030 and 2050. The response I got was that China will be the most powerful country in the world; many of the developing countries will have changed; America will still be powerful, but not as powerful as it is today; India and Brazil will be very powerful.</p>
<p class="contents">Never before have our selfish interests and our selfless interests coincided as they do now with the need to assist the developing world. In the past I used to be told that I spent too much time with my individual constituents who had poor housing conditions. My response to that was that you cannot tell somebody who is on fire that we are going to build a fire station. You have to plan for the fire station, but you have to help the individual at the same time. This has to be our approach to the developing world. If we do not do it, China and others are going to do it. It is our selfish interest as well as our selfless interest to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country which in recent history suffered famine, where the population today should be over 20 million. It has gone over six million for the first time since the mid-19th century. We have a post-colonial past. If you look at Ireland’s history, what we have been able to do with investment in infrastructure, largely from the European Union – to which we are now about to become, thank God, a net contributor – is an indication of what can be done when you give people the tools with which to do the job.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commissioner, when he goes to this meeting in Accra, to make sure that the European Union is singing off the same hymn sheet. Lisbon will give us the instruments with which to play a more effective role in the world. Make sure we do it in the area of development aid. It is in our interests as well as in the interests of the people in the developing world.</p>

I also thank the Commissioner for a particularly sound staff working paper for Accra.</p>
<p class="contents">Three points. Firstly, more effective aid indeed requires the donor countries to coordinate their aid better on the basis of a country strategy in which the partner countries in the south take the lead. However, that means that the priorities also have to be decided democratically in those countries, that is to say in cooperation with national parliaments and NGOs, which does not happen at the moment. It seems to me absolutely essential to involve women in the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, donor countries absolutely have to stop imposing innumerable conditions on aid and staking a lot on measurable results. The economic conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank in particular have to go, because they often conflict with the Millennium Goals. I therefore say to the rapporteur that paragraph 28 in the report should go.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, better aid is no excuse for less aid. At the moment not only is development aid falling, the figures are also confused by what is supposedly aid but is not really much help to the partner countries, such as money paid to students or refugees in Europe or cancellation of debts. It is therefore crucial for the donor countries to stick to their promises of the 0.7% and decide on concrete timetables. I hope, Commissioner, that the Council on Monday listens to this message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such an intention was that of the authorities in the countries beneficiary of development assistance, namely to bring the decision-making process closer to them, motivating that they know best what their needs are. Correct in itself, the decision has generated a vicious circle with negative effects for women. Since they are little present in the decision-making documents, their needs are considered minor, and the gender sensitivity of those in power is low, even lower than ours and the attention given to programmes designed for these needs, especially sexual and reproductive rights, has decreased. Thus, we are witnessing a dramatic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The only development objective for which no progress has been recorded is maternal mortality generated by the absence of elementary conditions, such as the possibility of a caesarean section, basic antibiotics, contraceptive pills or qualified personnel.

Unsatisfactory coordination of aid and a plethora of programmes have led to a drop in aid effectiveness. At the same time aid has been focused on so-called ‘attractive countries’ and many regions have thereby been completely forgotten. Fragmentation has led to a multiplicity of aid measures, which in several cases are wholly inconsistent with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, of great importance for the European Union and the development cooperation policy of the Member States to complement and strengthen each other. The Member States must coordinate their activities. Consideration should be given to the fact that several Member States are only starting out as aid donors, yet even they are aware of aid effectiveness. For example Estonia, which has not yet adhered to the Paris Declaration, has been prominent in tripartite cooperation projects. To prevent fragmentation of development aid and excessive focus by donors the silent partner option is used.</p>
<p class="contents">More than half the world’s formal development aid originates in the European Union. It is important to ensure the European Union’s presence in weak countries and especially in ‘forgotten’ countries. When granting aid we, the European Union, should be generous so that the aid can be accepted with dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to come back to a few points and reply briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, regarding food aid, in particular the rising price of cereals and the question of agricultural programmes, let me tell you that we have just finalised a communication on a European development strategy to respond to the food crisis. You will soon be receiving information about that document.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to correct some of the things that have been said, and I do not understand why they are constantly being asserted. Unilateral attacks on the common agricultural policy, based on very few real arguments, harm the European Union, convey false information and suggest to our partners that the common agricultural policy is the cause of all their woes. I say and I repeat: that is not true! We have been dismantling the system of agricultural subsidies since 1996 and the effects of our common agricultural policy cannot now be regarded as the cause of the developing countries’ troubles. I am prepared to discuss this question in detail at another meeting, because the accusation is being repeated like a sort of refrain, as though it were true. People are saying things that are not accurate. Europe has to a large extent sorted this issue, though there are still some questions that remain; I admit that there is some doubt about the coherence of our development policies. In regard to agriculture, however, if there is one sector where we have made real progress, it is that one. I do find it rather unfair of people to tarnish our image without good cause.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to the proposal concerning, I believe, a global fund. I know that Professor Geoffrey Sachs, who is incidentally a remarkable man, is fighting and campaigning for a global food fund. For my part, I am not in favour. I have strong hesitations about that; after all, it took a long time for the Global Fund to which Mr Ryan referred and which he seemed to think was a panacea, to work transparently and effectively. Why set up another fund when we have instruments such as the WFP, the FAO and others? Inventing new tools and instruments to tackle global policy weaknesses is certainly not the right answer. The tools exist. They simply need to be funded adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to reform the WFP, but how? The WFP must have a predictable annual budget and its financial operation must change. I spoke of that recently. It is a major problem. So we must not invent bad replies to good questions either. I am not in favour of creating a new fund because it would simply lead to a lot of red tape, a lot of procedures. On the subject of procedures, let me say a few words.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to agriculture, let me simply tell you that we will be moving from EUR 650 million in the ninth EDF to EUR 1 250 000 billion in the tenth EDF. I agree that is a lot in quantitative, percentage terms, but it is not a real increase in terms of the percentage of EDF funding. The positive aspect is that we have moved from four countries choosing to focus on the agricultural sector to 24 countries, i.e. more or less one third. That shows things have progressed, there is a greater awareness. Let me remind you, however, because this is important, that the choice of focal sectors is based in principle on ownership: it is our partners who decide on which sector they want us to focus our funding. It is important to remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">Next I was asked an interesting question: what will you do with the unused money intended for agriculture? In fact we will recover a large part of that money and allocate it to resolving the problem of rising prices and the food crisis. I prefer to speak of a food crisis, rather than of rising prices. At the Commission’s last meeting a week ago I proposed – a proposal that was very well received – that we should try to channel those resources in such a way as to give small farmers in poor countries access to seeds and fertilisers, because that is one of the biggest problem facing them today. If we want them to become self-sufficient, they obviously need better access to seeds and fertilisers, which would help them gradually to become self-sufficient in food. I am very much in favour of reducing the period during which aid is distributed as much as possible. I believe it is far more important to provide the farmers with the means of production. We all agree, as I said in my opening statement and need not repeat: Accra is a political rendezvous and I ask you – knowing that you are all aware that we have to do this – to mobilise our Member States so that they deliver on their commitments and agree to observe a calendar that demonstrates, as I believe Mr Borrell said, that they have a real political resolve and will keep their promises.</p>
<p class="contents">People keep talking about cumbersome procedures and asking me to streamline them. I must admit that I really have no powers in that respect. The procedures exist and I have to observe them; I can do no other. I can propose flexibility measures, but you know full well that it would take years for them to take effect. It is not widely known, but at the end of my term of office I intend to present all the lessons I have learned as regards procedures. I hear Mrs Martens say: ‘We need greater transparency’ – and I am ready for all the transparency you want – ‘but we also need greater effectiveness’. Let me tell you, however impertinent and shocking it may sound, that if you want even more transparency, which means even more controls, even more audits, even more consultations and so on, you will have less effectiveness. That is what I want to say to you. You may dismiss it, but I am convinced that is the case. So much transparency is now demanded that the Commission has become a chained giant, another Gulliver. Personally, I am prepared to talk and there are ways of achieving an effective level of transparency, but I beg you, do not keep talking about ‘transparency’, ‘control’, about how things should be … That is all very well and good, but you must face the facts … I would like to have the chance to trace the journey of a dossier. I can tell you it is no joke. Sometimes even I am at a complete loss to trace its journey, and then you have to remember the inter-services and all the others involved. It is an extremely complicated business. I do not want to caricature it, but I must say it is a real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Mr Hutchinson spoke of coordination, coherence and complementarity. He was quite right. I believe we could hugely increase the effectiveness of our aid if we had a better division of labour, if we were more coherent, more coordinated, and if we could indeed cut back on some of the intermediate, and often entirely useless, controls. I gave you a few figures earlier on: Tanzania has to produce 8 000 audit reports! I am not sure what sort of burden that represents for a country like Tanzania, which actually has a capacity for governance. There comes a time when surrealism verges on madness. There are limits. I have nothing against procedure, but enough is enough. I want no more procedure. Mr Hutchinson, in regard to the division of labour, you were right to emphasise the importance of the diaspora. We are trying to work with them, but it is precisely because of the procedures that we cannot do so. That is another example! You asked whether there are any projects to encourage young people to go and work in developing countries. No Sir, I cannot do so, the procedures do not authorise me to do so. I am told, for example, that there are certain NGOs with whom you cannot work. Indeed, I cannot work with certain NGOs because the procedures do not allow me to do so. Our new Member States may feel frustrated, and rightly so, because in most cases their NGOs, even though they are as good as the others, cannot work because they do not comply with the standards invented by Commission’s procedures. In a sense, they are, therefore excluded from our cooperation and our contribution, which is not fair. We are working on this, but it will take a long time to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that we need more. Mr Buzek spoke of combating climate change. Clearly, if we adjust the funding for development in order to work on climate change, we will be mortgaging all that we have done or intended to do in traditional development policy. That means we need new, additional resources to tackle climate change. Let me refer you to the idea we and Mr Borrell put forward, of setting up an international loan that would be tied to CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission quotas. That project is making good progress. Technically, it has been finalised. We worked with the World Bank. I shall be returning to this subject later, because it might also partly resolve the question of increased funding, in that it would help the Member States to meet their objectives and commitments in a way that would be less painful for their budgets in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously I at one with Mr Borrell in congratulating, first of all, Spain, because it is true that in a sense it is unfair. Some countries have made real efforts and allocated increased budget funds: in terms of its GDP, Spain has indeed made a huge effort. At the same time, some other countries really were in free fall, which in a sense eclipsed the actions of certain others. I must say that this is an important issue that arises again and again: 20% for education, health, water, etc. You know the reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I have already replied. Even if I agree as to the objective, I did say one must try to establish where budgetary aid expenditure – since the word budgetary was used – actually goes, because those are often the sectors that are funded. It is very difficult to give definite figures, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is our partner countries that choose the sector on which they focus, not us. So I cannot impose and tell them they have to spend on, say, education. I can suggest but I cannot impose. Of course I agree with Mr Mitchell that – to put it very baldly – we should increase our aid for selfish reasons. That is more or less true. I often point it out at meetings. Let those who do not want to give more aid for selfless reasons at least do so for their selfish interests. In this context, and looking in particular at Africa, we find that certain emerging countries have an extremely large presence there. I do not dispute the legitimacy or validity of their presence there, I am simply saying that it would be in Europe’s interest to have a somewhat stronger presence in a continent that is our neighbour and to which it can offer much added value while also drawing added value from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have covered everything now. I have replied to the two questions put by the last speaker, which were, if I may say so, very pertinent. I am really happy to be in the European Parliament. It is certainly the place with the most dynamism and the greatest determination to drive forward all these policies in which we believe with such conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More account must be taken of the priorities of the countries themselves. The aid needs to be more predictable. Technical assistance must be cut further. More budgetary support is needed, but also greater transparency and involvement by parliaments, the social midfield and local authorities. The code of conduct needs to be more effective and the Donor Atlas has to be extended, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my view the crux of the matter is that we, Parliament and the Commission – and why should we not involve the national parliaments as well? – need to put pressure on the Member States so that, first and foremost, they stick to their promises and, secondly, approve a plan in which they indicate very clearly what can and will be done within what period of time. Thirdly, they also have to involve themselves clearly in the division of labour proposed by the Commission. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that, with our friends and colleagues in the national parliaments, disregarding party boundaries, we should take the initiative in stepping up the pressure on the governments, which indeed concerns not just the joint but also the individual responsibility of a number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains a whole series of concrete recommendations. I sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will take these with them to Accra. Parliament is speaking with one voice here today, something that does not always happen, and is expressing the wish that the European Union in Accra will also speak with one voice, a clear voice, a loud voice, and above all a credible voice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been following with deep concern the latest political developments in Lebanon, where progress seemed to have stalled and violence and bloodshed had become increasingly rife.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with a great sense of relief and optimism that we welcome the comprehensive and fundamental agreement which has been concluded in Doha by the Lebanese political leaders at a time when the European Parliament is in the process of adopting a resolution on Lebanon. There is a compromise text, which will shortly be put to the vote, with Mr Onesta presiding.</p>
<p class="contents">This significant political breakthrough, which was achieved through the skilful and effective mediation of the Arab League, and especially of the Government of Qatar, paves the way for the election of General Michel Suleiman as President of the Republic of Lebanon in the coming days, the creation of a government of national unity and the adoption of an improved electoral law.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the favourable reaction of neighbouring states and other interested countries, the European Parliament calls on all parties to implement the agreement in full. We re-emphasise our unfailing support for the legitimate constitutionally established political institutions in Lebanon and the Lebanese armed forces and for their efforts to guarantee the stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to resuming normal interparliamentary relations with our Lebanese counterparts, with a Lebanese Parliament that meets regularly, exercises its democratic rights and discharges its democratic obligations.</p>

There are a number of reasons for the fact that there will be food shortages and that there will be more people needing food, and even starving. The first reason is, primarily, the increased population growth in third countries. The second is insufficient production of food and poor distribution. The third is that various interest groups are playing the markets. The fourth is the Common Agricultural Policy, which has resulted in significant reductions in food production in new Member States. Until this policy is changed, until we free food production and our reserves, then this, too, will contribute to food shortages and higher prices. The fifth reason relates to the various natural disasters over which we have no control, but which, unfortunately, result in great losses and complications.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a single conclusion: the problem of food is the most important problem, as, after all, it affects biological survival. It requires full solidarity, not just in the European Union, but also in the entire world. For this reason it has my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When food prices rise and, in addition, there is a significant increase in energy prices, this causes increased inflation. Politicians and economists are trying to analyse this situation and identify the causes. The following seem to be the main factors: changes in the global economy, including higher energy prices, reduced harvests and the production of biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased demand for food and increased affluence of the inhabitants in fast-growing countries such as India or China have also had an impact on rising food prices. Higher food prices affect both producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes in global food markets force us to think seriously about our food security strategy, or perhaps even rethink it entirely.

More than 10% of visa applications are rejected. According to the applicants, the process is often based on non-transparent criteria.</p>

This is often a characteristic of amending budgets and it makes it more difficult to assess the proposal. The basic issue, however, is the quality of the justification provided as well as the proposal’s procedural compliance with the Financial Regulations. It is completely justifiable to include in the 2008 budget unused ERDF, EAFRD and EFF structural funds (totalling EUR 771.6 million), which corresponds with both the wording and the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006, when we anticipated delays in the implementation of the new Financial Perspective. When voting for this budget amendment we can note with some satisfaction that over 500 out of 580 operational programmes for 2007-2013 have already been approved, which means we are passing into the realisation phase in this current seven-year period. The Parliament rapporteur also agrees with the modifications to the framework plans of two agencies, namely the European Medicines Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, in accordance with the submission from the European Commission, which constitutes a supplementary part of the initial budget amendment proposal no 2/2008.

<p class="contents">SMEs are the key to a genuine revival of research and development activity because by their very nature they are spurred on towards innovation in their struggle to survive in the marketplace. However, access to R&amp;D activities can sometimes be particularly burdensome in economic and bureaucratic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore endorse this report, which emphasises the need for the EU to apply the ‘think small first’ principle and to boost the potential for innovation and originality of SMEs, which are still one of the main drivers of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that a policy to promote small enterprise should incorporate subsidies and essential aid for research: examples of this are the ‘Best’ programme, which has facilitated an exchange of best practices between SMEs, the CIP and the 7-initiative policy framework. However, I also think it is essential to adopt a series of measures aimed at promoting entrepreneurship, such as reduction of barriers to the internal market, elimination of bureaucratic obstacles and facilitation of bank loans to SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should create the framework for the growth of companies, industrial investment, innovation and the creation of new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that, in this context, special attention has been paid to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, which, after all, constitute 99.8% of the companies in Europe. It is just these companies that most feel the effects of excessive bureaucracy. Calculated on a <span class="italic">per capita</span> basis, small companies incur, on average, costs that are ten times higher than those of large companies as regards the responsibilities imposed by legal regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, SMEs can experience greater difficulties than large companies in accessing markets. Let us not forget that it is SMEs, through their innovation and flexibility, that provide a significant boost to economic growth and improvements in the competitiveness of European business. For this reason it is extremely important to develop solutions that will help to reduce administrative burdens, increase SME access to the internal market and public tenders and help them respond to new challenges. The Small Business Charter that has been announced by the Commission is to include these kinds of proposals.</p>

<p class="contents">- the unprecedented stock market speculation on basic food prices, which is exploiting the tensions and the highly volatile agricultural markets in an unacceptable fashion;</p>
<p class="contents">- the growth in the cultivation of crops for energy purposes, at the expense of essential food crops;</p>

<p class="contents">Over and above emergency measures, when we report on the health of the CAP we must redefine the way we intervene on the world markets (infrastructure, intervention stocks, risk management, prospects and economic modelling of price changes, etc.), reconsider the decoupling of aid and globally rethink our agricultural production models to ensure that they are productive and enduring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was particularly shocking that the Commissioner should totally disregard the social drama and strong impact of the soaring food prices recorded in recent months – exacerbated by abandonment of the land and the disappearance of many thousands of farms – and push for a cut in the meagre support received by around 70 000 Portuguese smallholders by proposing a minimum threshold while forgetting to indicate a maximum one.</p>
<p class="contents">The negative effect of the last CAP reform is well known, particularly the untying of aid from production. It is therefore particularly serious that in the prevailing circumstances the total withdrawal of payments associated with production that still exists has been announced (with the sole exception of suckler cows, goats and sheep). These payments have been transferred to the single payment scheme, at the same time as progress is being made in the gradual dismantling of significant common market organisations and in dismantling the milk quota system, and in withdrawing intervention in areas such as durum wheat, rice and pigmeat, further promoting the abandonment of the land and farming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, rising food prices do not only affect poorer nations. The EU must now take action in order to stabilise this situation.

This is a problem that affects the whole world. There are many causes for this situation. They include increased demand for food, rising fuel prices, natural disasters (especially droughts), reduced acreage devoted to plants for human or animal consumption (the price of increasing the area of land designated for so-called energy agriculture) and so on. For this reason I would support the UN’s proposal for a moratorium on biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">What can also be seen is financial speculation on food markets. Another contributing factor is the issue of the erroneous and unnecessary quotas that restrict agricultural production, for example the milk quotas that place limits on the production of milk and milk products in Poland. Tragic consequences in the poorest countries result in food from our surpluses being given away for free or sold at token prices. This kind of aid is only helpful in times of catastrophes and disasters. Otherwise it completely destroys their farmers, since it is not worth their while either to grow crops or to keep animals. Fast-rising food prices combined with unemployment could also lead to social instability in these countries.</p>

<p class="contents">These agreements are unacceptable, not only because they do not respect Community competence in this area, but also because they undermine the principle of fair competition and give rise to unequal treatment between nationals of various Member States where visas are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the granting of a mandate to the Commission (under Community competence) to negotiate an agreement between the EU and the USA ensuring uniform treatment and applying the same conditions regarding visa exemption to all EU nationals who wish to enter US territory (as the Union in fact already applies in relation to all US citizens who wish to enter the EU).</p>
<p class="contents">These negotiations must be conducted rapidly and in a spirit of European unity, so that in 2009 all Member States will be able to participate in the USA’s reformed Visa Waiver Programme.</p>

<p class="contents">It marks an important step in coordinating activities of Member States and the European Commission in their negotiations with the United States. It recognises that discrimination of a large group of EU citizens is unacceptable and shows solidarity on the part of those Member States already in the programme with those who still face inconvenient and sometimes demeaning visa application procedures. It draws attention to the fact that reasons for visa refusal are non-transparent. A rapid fall in the rate of refusal in some countries and not others creates suspicions that countries outside visa waiver are not treated on the same terms by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Representing Poland, a country outside the visa waiver regime, I trust that the resolution will lead to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of an agreement allowing all EU citizens to travel to the US on the same terms.

These should be on behalf of all EU Members. The US government and the governments of those countries that have already embarked on bilateral negotiations should take into account the position of the EU and its competence to sign treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed are clear guidelines for bilateral discussions about travel to the United States without visas, but there are issues that are in the EU’s power. What is required here is mutuality. Unfortunately, as regards Poland, which unilaterally removed visa requirements for US citizens as long ago as 15 April 1991, the asymmetry is glaring. I am not convinced by the argument that this is due to the rather high level of refusals to grant visas.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion these refusals are often the result of arbitrary decisions taken by officials in the American consular service who assume – often it is not clear on what basis – that someone would illegally extend their visit to the USA. Such assumptions are hardly objective and sometimes simply insulting. Also, the exchange rate of the dollar against the zloty no longer supports the argument about illegal work. Today what is important to people are tourist visits, business trips and visits to friends and family. I believe that the United States also lose out with this policy, closing their frontiers to their allies but letting in potential terrorists. How can you develop transatlantic cooperation if there is no trust in your allies? This is not just a rhetorical question.

Earthquakes are catastrophic events that claim very many lives and cause huge damage to property.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.8, has shocked people all over the world. This devastating quake has claimed a large number of victims and has created extremely difficult conditions for those who have been affected by it, especially in Sichuan Province. I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the Chinese people and with the great many victims of this tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities reacted swiftly to the disaster by providing emergency relief measures. It should be noted that China was also willing to accept offers of aid from external sources. Moreover, it is gratifying to see that the Chinese and foreign media were allowed to transmit detailed and accurate information on the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">According to my estimates, the EU has already provided more than EUR 10 million in aid. However, China needs the practical experience of Europeans in this field even more than it needs financial aid. The emergency relief measures provided for the civilian population must therefore include tried and tested practices for reducing the impact of events of this kind. The EU has to make available the knowledge it has acquired from seismology research so as to help identify the reasons for the inadequate structural stability of buildings. The earthquake region of Sichuan must be converted into an open-air laboratory where potential solutions can be tested out and the findings used for the reconstruction of that province.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I met local environment activists in Kazakhstan, what seemed obvious in the West took on a new dimension from my standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">The Aarhus Convention is a major achievement in the aim to improve public participation and access to information rights and is a component in any successful system of democracy, and that is why I well understand Parliament’s position in which also the missing element, the right of the public to appeal, should be restored. I can sympathise, however, with the Council when it says it fears that citizens’ rights could be abused when it comes to lodging an appeal in order to slow down projects or establish a level playing field for fund-raising campaigns staged by organisations. The Council is right to be worried about this exploitation of democracy. It is important, however, that the issue should be raised once again: the world and our society are changing all the time, and political decisions must stand up to present-day scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this very reason that I like the paragraph in our resolution in preparation for the meeting which states that there is a desire to extend the Aarhus Convention to apply to all the principles of sustainable development. This way the criteria for sustainable development are met thanks to the Convention’s principles regarding openness, the chance for participation, and accountability. This is actually the idea behind the Aarhus Convention: it will generate a wide-ranging and proactive way of thinking about the environment, especially amongst the public, so creating new opportunities for improving existing practices. The Riga meeting will be a splendid opportunity for an interim evaluation of the Convention, and I am convinced that this is the way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, because Member States do not keep their word, which means that all the work carried out by European institutions ends up being worthless. Moreover, the report does not show clearly how Member States commit themselves to one role (supporters of partner countries in the implementation of aid) but really perform another (funding only those initiatives that are priorities for their own economies), without paying attention to the social and economic development of the partner countries (orphans).</p>
<p class="contents">Second, because more effectiveness and transparency is requested when discussing the funding of projects. Of course we want effectiveness. However, transparency means more audits, more consultations, more controls – in brief, more waste of time and money on bureaucracy, and this slows down rather than facilitates the work of MANY people. Transparency therefore reduces effectiveness. I would like to see transparency being used as a tool to achieve effectiveness and that the latter always prevails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This afternoon’s resolution particularly concerns the International Criminal Court, and the fact that, over a year ago now, two arrest warrants were issued by that Court for Ahmad Haroun, the Minister of the Interior at the time, who is now the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs – which I think many of us find deeply shocking – and also for one of the former Janjaweed militia leaders, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen absolutely no cooperation from the Sudanese Government in handing these people over to the International Criminal Court, although that Government is well aware that membership of the United Nations carries with it obligations. We are seeing an ongoing culture of impunity, where nobody is ever brought to account, it seems, for the most appalling crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that all governments should be taking a strong stance on this, and the resolution says that we should be calling on the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June to adopt targeted EU punitive measures against a clearly identified group of Sudanese officials who bear responsibility for this non-cooperation, with that action including clear financial sanctions – it appears that when the cries of people do not work, maybe stopping the flow of money will.</p>
<p class="contents">My group commends this resolution to the House. We look forward to firm action and hopefully seeing these men, and others, brought to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then the situation has become worse, not better. The agreement between the Islamic north and the non-Islamic south, reached after a long internal war, is under pressure. The temporary cooperation in a transitional government and preparation of the referendum on independence for the south in 2011 are under pressure because the borders of those areas have not been finally demarcated. Control of the oil-rich middle area is now the cause of further violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the peace settlement does not apply to west Darfur, since Arab nomads and solders have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad. This is a conflict not between supporters of Islam and Christianity, but between nomads and the settled agricultural population for control of arid land that produces very little. Because of population growth and desertification, the people are losing their traditional sources of livelihood and turning against each other. The government is also responsible for driving out the originally non-Arab population. There is now fighting from Darfur back as far as the capital, Khartoum.</p>
<p class="contents">Even when what is now Sudan was known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, it was debatable whether this huge area with widely differing populations should become independent as a single state. A unified state would mainly be the state of the Arab populations in the north, east and centre. It would be difficult for the black Islamic population in the west and the black Christians and animists in the south to gain an equal position. The regions that were at the time much less developed were far from the sea and were given very little international attention. Ultimately no one took any notice of them and we are now seeing the results of colonial shortsightedness.</p>
<p class="contents">The state is responsible for many crimes, but at the same time it is largely an instrument for one of the warring parties. That makes it difficult for it to cooperate with punitive measures. Obviously we are trying to keep the prospect of that open in the resolution, but in the current situation there is little cause for optimism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One issue that was at the basis of the fratricidal conflicts was ethnic differences – 52% of the population are African, 39% Arab – and religious differences – 70% are Sunni, 30% are animist.</p>
<p class="contents">During these wars the population experienced all possible atrocities at the hands of those with armaments and power, including murder, torture, rape, robbery and eviction, crimes that are prosecuted and punished by the International Criminal Court. Unfortunately the ICC does not have the means to bring the perpetrators to justice. The resolution presents the European view as regards the current situation and I support it. I do think, however, that in these circumstances it would be worth considering the use of a more radical approach, for example, using UN special forces to take the accused to the ICC, and then imprisoning those found guilty and interning them for life, with no right of return, on some distant island with some telling name such as Evildoers’ Island.

<p class="contents">Reports of untold acts of barbarism taking place in the region have abounded in recent years. The suffering of the innocent civilian population has been extreme. Those that allegedly were responsible for instigating or carrying out war crimes or crimes against humanity should face the law and, if found guilty, must be punished accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just necessary as a matter of natural justice but also in order to make sure that such individuals are prevented from repeating their crimes and that adequate example is given to other potential criminals to prevent them from carrying out similar crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Criminal Court was formed in order to make sure that those that commit war crimes and crimes against humanity do not go unpunished. Sudan has signed the Rome Statute which created the International Criminal Court but has not yet ratified it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no excuse for not offering this court its full cooperation in according with UN Security Council Resolution 1593. The International Criminal Court issued two arrest warrants against Sudan’s former Minister of the Interior, Mr Ahmad Haroun, and against the militia leader Ali Mohammed Ali Abd-al-Rahman. The warrants relate to 51 counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. For more than a year now the Sudanese authorities have refused to hand over these individuals and are thus obstructing the work of the International Court.</p>

Two and a half million people have left their homes to escape from the violence. Despite the partial stabilisation in the country, there are constant clashes between government forces and the rebels, which makes it difficult to use UN peacekeeping forces and to provide humanitarian aid. No lasting resolution of the Sudanese conflict will be possible without the involvement of the UN and without the UN increasing the number of soldiers in the region. The recruitment of children into the army and acts of violence against the civilian population, particularly against women, are clear breaches of international standards and human rights.</p>

A call should be made to Sudan to start cooperating immediately with the Court in order to deal with the war crimes, since this is a necessary condition for the creation of democracy and the rule of law.

On the basis of the recommendations made by this Committee, the European Union asked the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Council did by adopting Resolution 1593 in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, the European Union has repeatedly called on the Sudanese Government to cooperate unconditionally with the ICC.</p>
<p class="contents">On 31 March 2008, the anniversary of the Security Council’s referral of the situation in Darfur to the ICC, the EU Presidency adopted a Declaration on behalf of the European Union expressing its outrage at the Sudanese Government’s failure to cooperate with the Court. The European Union also expressed its willingness to support the adoption of new appropriate measures against those persons who bear responsibility for Sudan’s non-cooperation with the ICC, should the Sudanese Government still fail to comply with the UN Resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 May 2008, I attended a meeting between donors and the Sudanese Government – the Sudan Consortium – which was held in Oslo. At this meeting, I reminded my Sudanese interlocutors, while addressing the conference, that our development aid is intended to support development in Sudan subject to a genuine democratic transformation taking place in the country, as provided for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. I emphasised that the principles underlying the CPA must likewise apply to Darfur and that there was an urgent need to restore security, deploy the United Nations Mission and facilitate humanitarian access. The recent outbreak of violence in Abyei, a region fraught with complex problems that represent one of the major challenges in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan, emphasises the importance of implementing in full the CPA. I have just published a press release calling on both parties to comply with all CPA provisions, including the establishment of an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of other armed factions from the town of Abyei.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sudanese Government must know that the international community as a whole will remain faithful to the vision set out in the CPA of a peaceful, stable and democratic Sudan that demonstrates respect for the rule of law and for human rights. This message is not directed solely at the Sudanese Government – it must also be understood by the various armed rebel movements whose political cause, whatever it may be, does not justify committing crimes. The Court has issued a number of arrest warrants, including one against Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militia leader.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting of the UN Security Council, which will take place on 5 June in the presence of the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, may be an important opportunity for the international community to present a united front and to send a strong signal in support of the Court’s work. The External Relations Council scheduled for late June will most probably address the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to that, the refusal to grant entry visas prevents Members of the European Parliament and of national parliaments from seeing the situation for themselves. All this is highlighted in my Group’s motion. However, I think that our criticism of breaches of human rights must be measured by absolute criteria, rather than following a political scale of who in the world plays first fiddle at the moment. That is not right. We keep running around in circles; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia. The Romans were always right and their chroniclers painted it as a wrongdoing when an attacked opponent was bold enough to defend himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me get back to Belarus, however. Lukashenko’s regime is first and foremost an attempt to disrespect the direction in which the Euro-Atlantic initiatives are going. Mr Lukashenko plays in his own narrow field, ignoring the fact that moderate-sized countries cannot behave like that since supranational capital will not allow it. If you do not obey, you will be isolated and the international community will support the opposition within the country. That is how it works and we all know it. Sooner or later Mr Lukashenko and his party machine will pay dearly for acting in this manner. Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO. The present US Administration and the governments of some other countries would very much like Belarus to join NATO, together with Ukraine and Georgia, thereby causing damage to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our worries about human rights in Belarus would not be so intense if, in fact, the real issue was not Russia. The question is, however, whether attempts to weaken Russia help the issue of world security. I am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control. Russia has been suppressing them for several millennia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand there is the desire that has been publicly and officially declared to normalise relations with the European Union. The opening of the representative office of the European Commission in Minsk is a symbol of this desire.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, in the same month, the police brutally attacked demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of the country’s independence. The following day the authorities sent KGB special forces to independent journalists. A month later the activists were handed down long sentences and this is not even the opposition, just people who dared to demonstrate in defence of citizens’ rights and the rights of small businesses, such as Andrei Kim or Sergei Parsukiewicz. We have also recently heard that Alexander Milinkiewicz was arrested and fined just for meeting Belarus citizens and for discussing public issues with them. Alexander Kazulin, the most important political prisoner, a prisoner of conscience in contemporary Europe, is still in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as the chairman of the Belarus delegation I would like to see the day when we can put forward a Resolution to the European Parliament that notes with satisfaction that changes have taken place in Belarus to make that country part of the civilised European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately this will not happen today. Without any guarantees for the fundamental rights of free and democratic elections, to express one’s political opinions, freedom of the press and freedom to practise one’s religion, there is no possibility that the European Union should ever recognise the regime in Belarus as a country with which it is worth cooperating, or as a country that it is worth helping. We shall never support the policies that are practised by Alexander Lukashenko. We shall, however, support independent citizens’ groups and individual citizens from Belarus in their contacts with the European Union in the hope that one day the country will return to normality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, vital democratic norms are presently much compromised in this country.

Such respect is an indispensable requirement of any non-dictatorial government.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports coming out of Belarus of arbitrary arrests of members of civil society and opposition activists, of the use of excessive force against peaceful demonstrators and of repression of independent media journalists are evidence of practices which should, and must, be terminated immediately. We call on the Belarusian Government to see reason, to change its tactics and to choose the road of freedom and democracy rather than the road of suppression and totalitarianism, which can only lead to worsening of the conflict with its own people and with the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close. Newspaper offices are raided to intimidate critical voices in the press. Free elections and freedom of assembly and expression are being severely restricted. Opposition politicians are being systematically prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences. The authorities are taking repressive measures against movements within civil society, either by invoking obscure laws on NGOs or anti-extremist legislation or by using force to break up peaceful gatherings.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, must move to promote the culture of political pluralism in Belarus. Encounters with democratic structures, especially for young people, are particularly important for the future of the country. The reopening of the European Humanities University in Vilnius, a Belarusian university-in-exile that offers a place of refuge for students who are victims of political persecution, was a wise move.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step must be visa facilitation, for which this House has called on several occasions. It is not right that the EU should further restrict people's freedom of movement by charging a fee of EUR 60 to issue a visa. That is almost a third of a monthly income in Belarus and is therefore unaffordable for many people. What we have managed with Ukraine, Moldova and Russia we should also be able to do with Belarus.</p>

This resolution calling for the immediate release of the members of the opposition who have been arrested is at the same time a show of support and solidarity for all those who are suffering under the current Belarusian regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week members of Belarus’s political opposition will come here to Parliament to ask the EU to support a petition rejected by Lukashenko to amend the law restricting freedom of religion which took effect in 2002.

The channel, which broadcasts mainly in Belarusian, now reaches some 10% of Belarusians via satellite.</p>
<p class="contents">The station is working under constant pressure. At the end of March KGB and police in Belarus carried out a raid to apprehend Belsat’s local reporters. Their basic tools, i.e. laptop computers and broadcasting technology, were seized. Independent reporters live in constant fear of interrogation and arrest. The situation in Belarus, an immediate neighbour of the European Union, is as harsh as it was behind the iron curtain. As the Chair of the Moldova delegation and an Estonian, I state here that the citizens of Belarus, which was also part of the Soviet Union, today need independent information as much as they need oxygen. Belsat is an excellent start, but good television does not come cheap.</p>
<p class="contents">The journalists working for Belsat Belarus are fighting for democracy; they visited us in the European Parliament in March and they need our comprehensive support. I call upon the European Commission and all our Member States to support Belsat financially and morally.

In addition, for the first time, he tried to blackmail the European Union by reminding us that 50% of the oil, 50% of the oil products and 30% of the gas coming to the European Union passes through Belarus. This is a reference to the Yamal-Europe natural gas pipeline and the ‘Friendship’ oil pipeline.

It is important for us Poles, as well as for the inhabitants of other neighbouring countries, that there be a stable political and economic situation in the region as this provides the basis for development and improvements in quality of life for our inhabitants. We must also remember that, like Poland, Belarus was forgotten about and handed over to Soviet domination after World War II and could not count on any outside assistance. However, this country managed to become independent and now can boast of a GDP growth of over 8%, and even 9.9% in the years 2003-2006.</p>

However, what does concern us is that one hears ever more frequently about breaches of human rights in Belarus, which means infringements of democracy.

Regrettably, renewed pressure on civil society and a number of particularly harsh and disproportionate sentences have ruined this positive atmosphere. We continue to condemn the political arrests and the way in which civil society and the independent media are being treated.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must make Belarus understand that we mean what we say when we propose a partnership subject to progress being made with regard to respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. However, in order to make such progress, Belarus needs to take a number of measures that, for us, are essential. These include the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Alexander Kazulin.</p>
<p class="contents">They also include the holding of parliamentary elections, scheduled for September, which must comply with democratic principles. In this regard, we ask that the international OSCE/ODIHR observers be granted unhampered access. The Belarusian authorities have informed us of their intention to admit both short-term and long-term observers; we will be sure to hold them to their word. Naturally, the presence of observers from the European Parliament would be an additional source of valuable expertise. It is also vital that opposition parties participate fairly in these elections. We will take into account any suggestions made by Parliament in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, irrefutable evidence that progress has been made would be the presence of opposition in this Parliament, which is not currently the case. In that event, the European Union would be ready to respond positively, as it confirmed only last month in a statement relating to sanctions and to the progress that would encourage us to ease these sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now address an issue that we feel most strongly about: contacts with the people of Belarus. However regrettable the situation in Belarus may be, we must expand our contacts. Naturally, restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities are still being maintained. Nevertheless, I think that it is necessary to draw a distinction between political and technical levels. Accordingly, the Commission is holding meetings to discuss technical issues such as energy, transport and the environment with experts from the Belarusian administration. These contacts are obviously a means of getting across various messages on matters about which we feel very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we currently have a delegation in Minsk will also enable us to forge closer links both with the Belarusian administration and with civil society, local NGOs, independent media and students, all of whom we have a duty to assist, as you have rightly pointed out in your report and as several speakers have said. In addition, aid is being provided to the European Humanities University, which is currently in exile in Vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the University is unable to return to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to broach a subject that comes up time and time again: visas. As you and I are aware, we are unable, as things stand, to open negotiations on the easing of visa restrictions with Belarus – this has been determined by the Council – but this does not prevent us from taking advantage of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States under the Schengen rules as part of their consular prerogatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alain Hutchinson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initially, we did not wish Parliament to consider right now the situation in Burundi, for, as you know, the Burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the FNL, the National Liberation Forces; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should, we hope, lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in Dar es Salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting, violence and insecurity affecting the country. As we now know, the beating of a butterfly’s wings in Strasbourg may sometimes unleash a hurricane thousands of miles away.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, not to speak of the situation of this small country that has been orphaned in terms of its development, having been stripped of its natural resources of the kind that often attract donors, would have been unthinkable. Therefore, in agreement with the other political groups, we wanted to make this resolution into a call for positive action with regard to this associated country situated in the troubled Great Lakes Region. We wanted to reiterate the EU’s determination, and especially that of Parliament and of yourself, Commissioner, to seek new solutions for development aid that are more effective in those countries that are weakened by situations of conflict – in this instance, civil war – countries where issues such as the process of democratic reconstruction, the restoration of destroyed public services and the relaunch of policies on matters as fundamental as health and education might be addressed and supported more effectively and more rapidly. We wanted this resolution to form part of the action plan that the Netherlands has been asked to develop for Burundi, which has been selected – and we are delighted that it has been so selected – as one of three pilot countries under this new approach. Therefore, we have made our wishes clear. We want Burundi to become a model of development and, in order to achieve this, we want the authorities of this small country to be provided with the financial resources and support required for civil, political and economic reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will monitor developments very closely, but it also wishes to call on Burundian MPs from all political groupings to seek, as a matter of urgency, ways and means of bringing their institutions back into operation, after having been prevented from carrying out their work for months, with a view to holding debates and voting, as well as allowing the Burundian Government to implement projects aimed at reconstruction such as the long-awaited reform of the judiciary and that of the healthcare system, among other areas requiring urgent action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should like to point out that Burundi, one of the world’s poorest countries, receives proportionately the least amount of development aid per capita. This cannot continue. We should like to request that additional financial resources be released quickly to finance priority development programmes and, in particular, the rebuilding of shattered infrastructure. Along with the EU, only five Member States are represented in Burundi, a country where everything remains to be done. We hope that these countries coordinate their efforts effectively prior to any decision-making in Europe’s capital cities and that the delegations on the ground in Burundi entrusted with implementing development policies continue working together and that their staff numbers are increased.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the paragraph in our resolution which refers to the maintenance of, and possible increase in, much-needed humanitarian aid, and I should also like to urge that arrangements for the withdrawal of this aid be made in close association with the stepping up of development policies whose implementation is more complex. In this connection, we wanted to make the point so as to ensure that the visibility of the measures taken locally by the Burundian authorities, with the backing of the European Union and the Member States, is properly acknowledged. Apart from the resolution of conflict with the FNL and the restoration of greater security, the Burundian people urgently need to see improvements in their country’s development reflected in their troubled daily lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Dozens of deaths and thousands more displaced people show that the efforts to build peace are, at least for the moment, clearly not enough. The responsibility for this state of affairs should be shared.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clearly regrettable that the FNL has taken up arms again, but it has to be said that there have been many allegations of human rights violations by the Burundian Armed Forces and police force.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that instability in Burundi could have important and serious consequences for the region, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that greater stability has come to Burundi since the entry into force of a new constitution followed by general elections. However, this also strengthens the need for the establishment of a peace and reconciliation commission as a confidence-building measure. The European Union must support such an initiative financially and logistically.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context, and especially considering, as has been said, that the European Union has chosen Burundi as a pilot country for the implementation of a priority Action Plan aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of assistance, that I think this resolution deserves special consideration. Not only by the European Commission, but also, and fundamentally, by Member States, and especially two of its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the proposal to increase the financial resources that the European Union grants to Burundi, notably on the occasion of the mid-term review of the tenth EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, that within the framework of the much-needed action plan, priority support should be given to programmes for better governance and democratic state management; health policies, through the creation of health centres and the renewal of the hospital network; the decision by the government of Burundi to provide free primary education; and the continuing efforts to renew the country’s infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resulting problems are much harder to solve in Burundi than in other African countries. It is difficult to draw a geographical border between areas that are typically the territory of different ethnic groups. It is more akin to the caste system that traditionally existed in India. Even before the German and Belgian colonisation, the Hutus were in the majority in Burundi and Rwanda and the Tutsis were in the minority. The Tutsis, who are also recognisably different in appearance from the Hutus, were the rulers. The Hutus were under their control.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European colonial period attempts were made to change that situation, but not with a view to equality and equal rights for the Hutus. At the time the main aim was to play the two ethnic groups off against each other in order to make the Dutch or Belgian administration stronger. Even after independence, a lasting solution was never found to the old differences. Burundi was spared the massive campaign by the Hutu majority in neighbouring Rwanda to the north to wipe out the troublesome Tutsi minority. However, that might also be due to the fact that emancipation amongst the Hutus was less widespread</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak in the resolution about 14 years of civil war, peace negotiations, the opposition movement FNL, the disarming of rebels and the fighting that broke out again on 17 April, we have to be aware of the background and the unresolved problems. The main purpose of the resolution is that the violence should stop and that agreement must be reached. I agree with that, but on that point in particular I see little cause for optimism. The resolution also calls for European support for democratic government, education and health care. We can contribute to that ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This conflict has not just resulted in innocent victims, but, first and foremost, is destabilising the delicate balance and is increasing tensions in the country, which saw positive results following the peace accord in 2003. After many years of conflict in Burundi, the country is trying to rebuild itself and to return to the international arena and has been achieving some success.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more of a paradox is the fact that the problem being experienced by Burundi at present is not caused by Hutu-Tutsi tribal conflict, but has been brought about by a single, very radical, Hutu-FNL wing, which did not accept the peace accord and is still trying to fight the coalition government, which also includes the Hutu. The international community should give its support to the peace agreement and bring about an end to the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission is therefore delighted that, on 16 May 2008, a delegation from the Palipehutu-FNL – that is, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People-National Liberation Forces – returned to Bujumbura, and I hope that it will be possible for both sides to resume active talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I prefer to leave to one side the reply that I had prepared, for I have listened to a number of comments, and I feel that it is my duty to state a few facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to you – to be brief and to avoid repeating the excellent speeches that I have heard, especially those made by Mr Hutchinson, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Bowis – first of all, that the situation in Burundi today has nothing to do with ethnic problems and to suggest that it is an ethnic crisis is to look at it from a different and extremely dangerous perspective. Therefore, I am inclined to share Mr Hutchinson’s view, although I do regret somewhat that this debate is taking place here and now. It comes at rather an inopportune moment, for I feel that we must now give political dialogue a chance. Speaking as you have done, Mr Meijer, of an ethnic cause, is extremely dangerous guesswork.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Hutchinson pinpointed the following fact: the international community, caught up as we are, and this applies to the World Bank – I have spoken on the subject with Bob Zoellick – and to the Commission, caught up in our procedures that prevent us, when a country is plunged into formal democracy, from releasing funds to show that there is a dividend to peace; this is one of the reasons why Burundi is finding it difficult to get moving again, as is the case, for example, in Liberia, as is the case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as is the case in any country that is categorised as a post-conflict country. We are caught up in our procedures, we have no flexibility and so we cannot offer a rapid response to these countries’ reconstruction needs, for this is where the real problem lies for Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall naturally refrain from commenting on the speech which called for the deployment of European military forces – I am not saying that this is a separate issue – but it is clearly an issue that is somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. We continue actively to support Burundi, both politically and financially, in its peace-building and socio-economic recovery efforts. I should like to point out that our cooperation commitments for the period 2008-2013 currently amount to EUR 188 million, and it has been suggested that this funding might be further increased during the mid-term review. In this connection, I must tell you that the rule is that it will be possible to increase this level of funding only if Burundi has properly taken up all the funds allocated under the initial aid package. This is the rule, and I hope that the country will be in a position to benefit from this mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy adopted for this new period involves an increase in our budgetary support and identifies two areas on which attention should be focused: firstly, rehabilitation and rural development, which is clearly crucial for ensuring the survival of the populace; and, secondly, the healthcare sector. Our efforts to assist this country in its socio-economic recovery seek to demonstrate to the Burundian people what they can expect from the peace dividends as a stimulus to improve their situation. Burundi has been selected as a pilot country with a view to implementing the Council conclusions of November 2007, this has been mentioned, and I am delighted that is has been so selected. We have also agreed, together with the United Nations World Food Programme, to implement a pilot operation in Burundi, particularly in the area of education and the provision of canteens for schoolchildren, for it is clear that when children are provided with free meals, they will naturally want to go back to school. We shall also carry out a pilot case study that will include Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I shall be visiting Burundi in the near future, as the Commission is very closely involved in all these mediation efforts. I should like to add that, when I was Foreign Minister, I participated directly in the Arusha negotiations with President Mandela, so it is a subject that I know rather well, and I can tell you, Mr Meijer, that the Burundian Constitution, the Burundian legislative system and the Burundian Parliament – the National Assembly and Senate – provide all the institutional solutions that are needed to bring the ethnic problem firmly under control. Therefore, it is not an ethnic issue, it is an issue of unease within the one ethnic group, rather than with the other group, and it is clearly a different problem from the one concerning the FNL. The FNL must now come to the negotiating table, turn itself into a genuine political party and participate in the country’s recovery and reconstruction.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On the basis of the progress report drawn up by the Commission, in December 2007 the Council noted the progress Montenegro has made during last year, including adopting a constitution and establishing the necessary legal framework and institutions following the declaration of independence. The Council stressed the need for Montenegro to implement the new constitution in line with European standards and to continue efforts in broadening consensus on basic features of state building. It encouraged Montenegro to continue enhancing its administrative capacity and striving to achieve significant reform results, notably in strengthening the rule of law and fighting corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, administrative capacity is a weak point for a newly established country. The authorities in Montenegro are trying to address the shortcomings. The government is continuing to make efforts to increase administrative capacity and complete the reform of public administration. Although the legal framework has been completed, a great deal of work remains to be done. Appropriate funds will be necessary in order to achieve the government’s objectives. Overall progress in this area has been slow and consequently public administration is still weak and ineffective.</p>
<p>The new constitution has introduced changes to the judiciary, which has become less dependent on parliament as a result. Nonetheless, the provisions of the constitution must be implemented. Despite some progress, judicial reform in Montenegro is only just beginning.</p>
<p>Education policy too is slowly being brought up to European standards. Access to basic schooling is almost optimal in Montenegro.</p>
<p>The necessary framework has been established for the protection of minorities. Following the declaration of independence, Montenegro signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The constitution provides a firm basis for the protection of minorities but implementation is faltering in certain areas. The position of refugees and displaced persons, including a considerable number of Roma from Kosovo, is causing serious concern.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0288"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will certainly be aware that in December 2006 the Commission published a green paper and launched broad public discussions with interested groups (industry, traders, consumer organisations, etc.) on the functioning of trade defence instruments (TDIs).</p>
<p>One of the conclusions of these discussions is that a properly functioning TDI system is urgently necessary to defend industries in the Community from unfair trade or subsidisation of imports and to ensure public confidence in fair trade. At the same time it was established that it would be necessary to remodel certain elements of that system.</p>
<p>The initial discussions, which took place in the Council’s preparatory bodies in 2007, demonstrated that consensus could be reached on certain elements of the green paper, for example on the need for greater legal certainty, predictability, and transparency and independent decision-making. However, these discussions also revealed diverging views on certain points.</p>
<p>In mid-January 2008 Commissioner Mandelson stated that more time is required to continue consultations with interest groups on how to proceed with the TDI review process, and he gave an assurance that any proposal would reflect the legitimate interests of all the parties concerned. The Council has not yet received a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The Presidency is continuing to make informal efforts to reach consensus on this matter between the Member States, and the next presidency will certainly continue these efforts. We support the EP’s efforts in this regard and we welcome any recommendations on reform of the Community’s trade defence instruments from the Committee on International Trade as a significant contribution to the internal discussions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, as part of the world trade negotiations in Geneva in connection with the WTO Doha Development Agenda, discussions are taking place on amending the existing wording of the agreements on anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures. These discussions are taking place in a ‘Group on Rules’ and any results from the discussions in Geneva will also have an effect on basic European legislation on trade protection measures. One of the EU’s objectives is to strengthen the rule-based international trading system and to ensure that all rules adopted by trading partners are applied more consistently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As was stated, on 3 April 2008 the Court of First Instance annulled Council Decision 2002/460/EC of 17 June 2002, in so far as it concerns the PKK, and Council Decision 2004/306/EC of 2 April 2004, in so far as it concerns KONGRA-GEL, on grounds of absence of justification.</p>
<p>The decisions which the Court annulled are no longer in force and were replaced by another decision. The Council decision currently in force was adopted in December 2007 (2007/868/EC) and amended on 29 April 2008 (2008/342/EC and 2008/343/EC). The PKK (and KONGRA-GEL, which is another name for the PKK) was listed in the annex to that decision. The Court’s recent judgments do not affect the validity of that decision, and it should be noted that the applicants did not want to challenge it in those proceedings, even though the Court invited them to do so.</p>
<p>As regards the procedure which it employed in adopting Decision 2007/868/EC, during the first half of 2007 the Council conducted a thorough review and consolidation of its procedures for the listing and de-listing of persons, groups and entities pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001. It now employs a clearer and more transparent procedure. This means that it now provides justification in respect of any person or organisation subject to an asset-freezing measure.</p>
<p>The new procedures were first employed in 2007 as part of a regular review which ended in June 2007 with the publication of an updated list.</p>
<p>The new procedures were also taken into account in the adoption of the decision currently in force and consequently PKK/KONGRA-GEL was officially informed of the reasons for its inclusion in the above list. In addition, the Council recently studied additional information on PKK/KONGRA-GEL and on 29 April 2008 accordingly amended the justification and then communicated the amended justification to PKK/KONGRA-GEL and invited it to submit its observations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be mentioned that persons, groups and entities included in the list can:</p>
<p>request the Council to reconsider their case, on the basis of supporting documentation;</p>
<p>challenge the decision of the national competent authority according to national procedures;</p>
<p>if subject to restrictive measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, challenge the Council’s decision before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 230(4) and (5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community;</p>
<p>if subject to restrictive measures under Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, request humanitarian exemptions to cover basic needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In connection with the separation of network operators from suppliers of electricity and gas (EU Directives 2003/54/EC<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2003/55/EC<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), the question arises how Member States levy value added tax (VAT) on the operations of the separated network operators and suppliers. Some use the 'agent' model, which means that the supplier (the undertaking which transmits the energy) is required to collect VAT for the whole chain and pass it on to the tax authorities. Where this customary model is applied, the VAT payable by the supplier and his 'supplier' (the network operator) can be processed independently. However, if this model is not (or is no longer) permitted, the amounts of VAT which the supplier quotes on invoices to customers for the transmission service must correspond precisely to the amounts of VAT which the transmitting undertaking invoices for the particular customer. The supplier must explicitly quote on the invoice VAT on transmission as a separate item from the VAT on its own service. This mutual dependence of the supplier and transmitter is particularly troublesome to the businesses concerned in the event of a default on payment, change of address by the customer or switch to a new supplier.</p>
<p>Can the Council confirm that, following the separation of network operation and supply, the above 'agent' model is permitted on the basis of the EU law in force?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Since the accession of Romania and Bulgaria the EU has had two Member States which border directly on the Black Sea region. Consequently, the EU is no longer an external player in the region. The establishment of closer links between the EU and the countries of the Black Sea region is in the interests of the EU and the Black Sea countries. This region has increasing strategic importance to the European Union since it has great economic potential, as a market of 190 million people, and is also an important transit route.</p>
<p>The European Union has already established bilateral relations with all the countries of the Black Sea region, that is to say in connection with:</p>
<p>–	the pre-accession process with Turkey;</p>
<p>–	the European Neighbourhood Policy (five European Neighbourhood Policy action plans – Moldova, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia);</p>
<p>–	the strategic partnership with Russia;</p>
<p>–	the appointment of two EU special representatives in the region, for the Southern Caucasus in 2003, and for Moldova in 2005;</p>
<p>–	the EU Border Assistance Mission to Ukraine and Moldova (EUBAM); and</p>
<p>–	the EUSR Border Support Team in Georgia.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to develop bilateral relations with various countries. However, at present it is the countries facing particular challenges which require coordinated action at regional level.</p>
<p>The ‘Black Sea Synergy’ initiative, which the Commission launched in April 2007, is designed to promote cooperation in the region and between the EU and the region as a whole.</p>
<p>‘Black Sea Synergy’ will be aided by the European Neighbourhood Policy and the other EU policies applied in relations with countries in the region.</p>
<p>Further key points to note are as follows:</p>
<p>First, stability in the European neighbourhood is a key strategic objective of European security strategy. The EU associates with this the embedding of democracy and the rule of law, the promotion of human rights, good governance, socio-economic development and the reduction of poverty, in other words the ‘europeanisation’ of the transition and reform processes in the region.</p>
<p>Second, on account of the need for diverse energy sources and energy supply routes the advantages which a greater presence in the region brings to the EU have increased in recent times. The Black Sea region is a production and transit region of strategic importance to the security of EU energy supplies. It has considerable potential in terms of diversity of energy supply and is therefore an important element of the EU’s external energy policy. Diversity of secure energy supply is in the interests of the partners in the region and the EU. Consequently, stability and security are all the more important to the EU and it would therefore like to see a resolution of the disputes in the region, which perhaps still pose the greatest obstacle to lasting peace and sustainable development.</p>
<p>In addition, good neighbourly relations and close cooperation between the countries of the region remain very important to the EU. Improvement in relations within the region will build mutual trust and open up the way to lasting progress.</p>
<p>The EU is not proposing the formation of new institutions or administrative structures. The Black Sea countries will continue to be the EU’s main contacts both at bilateral level and in discussions at regional level. However, the EU is of course willing to strengthen contacts with regional organisations.</p>
<p>‘Black Sea Synergy’ is not limited to economic cooperation. Its objective is also to establish a region characterised by sustainable democracy, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>The EU is making particular efforts to ensure that the opportunities for resolving existing disputes in the region are exploited. Too many lives have already been destroyed by the hatred, poverty and hopelessness which these disputes are causing. It is unacceptable for the European Union to close its eyes to such suffering on its doorstep in the twenty-first century. The EU can and must play a part in finding a way out of these black holes of despair.</p>
<p>The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States met their colleagues from the wider Black Sea area for the first time in Kiev on 14 February 2008. The meeting was co-chaired by Ukraine, which at that time held the presidency of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation (BSEC) (Foreign Minister Volodymyr Ohryzko), and the European Union (Slovenian State Secretary Andrej Šter and Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Benita Ferrero-Waldner). The joint statement adopted at the end of the meeting is an important political document which provides guidance for future work.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) draws up key scientific material which is of decisive importance in shaping policy. The panel was established in 1988 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly to provide decision-makers with an impartial source of information on climate change. Its role is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the latest scientific, technical and socio-economic information published throughout the world, which helps provide an understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change, its actual and potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.</p>
<p>The assessment reports which the IPCC has been publishing since 1990 show progress in the scientific understanding of climate change and its impact. The Fourth IPCC Assessment Report (AR4, 2007) presents the most comprehensive and reliable assessment of climate change to date. According to the report, ‘warming of the climate system is unequivocal’ and ‘most of the global average warming over the past 50 years is very likely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases’.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly referred to the IPCC’s findings, for example in its conclusions of 30 October 2007 (14178/07, p. 10).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0307"></a>

<p>The European Union has reiterated its commitment to supporting genuine power sharing and to working with the new Kenyan Government to return Kenya to the path of development and stability.

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that food prices are rising across the world, thereby threatening recent achievements in reducing poverty and malnutrition and jeopardising implementation of the millennium development goals. This can also cause instability, as demonstrated by the food price riots in countries across the world.</p>
<p>The Council considers that it is necessary to take steps to provide short-term aid for the poorest countries and the most vulnerable groups in society and at the same time to curb food prices through medium-term measures, in particular an increase in agricultural production.</p>
<p>The problem of the sharp rise in food prices also poses an additional challenge to development policy. The May Development GAERC will also discuss the issue and adopt conclusions on short, medium and long-term measures to resolve the problem of the rise in food prices. The EU has already stepped up its provision of food aid and humanitarian assistance in the worst affected countries and released additional funds to help the most vulnerable groups in society. In 2008 the Commission has provided EUR 223 million for humanitarian assistance and food aid. As a result of the increase in the costs of existing humanitarian assistance programmes and of financing new ones, the EU will have to increase the funds available. Additional funds will also be provided by many Member States. In the medium term other development cooperation instruments and other appropriate Commission instruments could be used to tackle the negative effects of the crisis caused by the increase in food prices. In its dialogue with third countries the EU will try to dissuade countries from introducing bans on food exports and instead promote development-friendly use of the funds obtained as a result of high food prices. In the long term the EU will encourage developing countries, especially the less developed ones, to implement an appropriate agricultural policy, in particular as regards increasing food security. The Council is convinced that the key to increasing food production and global food supplies is to increase the aid given to developing countries to develop their own agriculture to bring about positive long-term effects, since that will enable those countries to exploit their potential for agricultural production more effectively. In that connection the EU will take account of the conclusions of the FAO High-Level Conference held at the beginning of June.</p>
<p>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the rising prices of food and agricultural produce at its April meeting and considered the matter again at its May meeting. The European Council will assess the situation at its June meeting and lay down further operational guidelines on this matter, in particular in the broader framework of the millennium development goals. The Council is also discussing this problem with its partners within the competent international fora.</p>
<p>In practice the EU has already taken measures to increase production and curb price rises as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. The temporary elimination of the set-aside requirement has allowed farmers in the EU to assign up to 10% extra land for production (in particular for the production of cereals). Increasing the milk quota by 2% from April 2008 is also allowing milk producers in the EU to produce more milk. In addition, the EU has lifted import duties on cereals and intends to extend this arrangement to the following marketing year.</p>
<p>The ‘health check’ of CAP reform currently under way will provide the next opportunity to adopt specific short-term solutions such as, for example, the final abolition of set-aside, a further increase in milk quotas, a further detachment of aid from production in other sectors with tied aid, and the abolition of the energy crop premium.</p>
<p>As regards the medium term, it should be noted that the accession of the new Member States increased the agricultural area of the EU by around 40%. The production capacity of the new Member States is increasing year by year. This promise, and the constant renewal and rationalisation of agricultural production in all the Member States, will enable the EU to make an ever greater contribution to world food production and thus to greater food security in the world.</p>
<p>In the long term, the EU should better coordinate the agricultural research and development projects throughout its territory in order to develop new technologies which will increase agricultural productivity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0311"></a>

<p>The promotion and protection of the rights of the child are an important aspect of internal and external EU policy. In December 2007 the Council adopted EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child in which it reiterated the EU’s unconditional commitment to promote and protect the rights of the child arising from key international and European legal human rights instruments, norms and standards as well as political commitments relevant to the promotion and protection of the rights of the child.</p>
<p>The EU has for many years made, and will continue to make, efforts to support the promotion of the rights of the child arising from multilateral measures, the most important of which are as follows:</p>
<p>implementation of the 2003 EU Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict;</p>
<p>raising the awareness of third countries, in particular in political dialogue, in relation to the rights of the child;</p>
<p>funding, in particular as part of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), of projects to promote and protect the rights of the child;</p>
<p>monitoring progress on speeding up the promotion of human rights in the enlargement process and support for the reform of child protection in the candidate countries and potential candidate countries;</p>
<p>annual EU sponsorship, together with the countries of Latin America, of a resolution on the rights of the child within the United Nations and regular urging of countries to sign, ratify and implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the optional protocols to that convention;</p>
<p>support for the efforts of the competent international and regional actors relating to the promotion of the rights of the child, in particular the efforts of the UN Secretary General, the UN Security Council, the UN Treaty Bodies, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Special Procedures mechanisms, the appropriate UN agencies, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), and also regional mechanisms, in particular the Council of Europe, the OSCE, the European Network of Ombudspersons for Children and civil society organisations;</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 17 February 2008 the Kosovo Assembly adopted a resolution which declares Kosovo to be independent. The Council reiterated the European Union’s readiness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region, and recalled the European Union’s commitments contained in the conclusions of the European Council of 14 December 2007, as well as the agreement to Joint Actions establishing an ESDP Police and Rule of Law mission and appointing an EU Special Representative in Kosovo. In its conclusions of 18 February the Council noted that the Member States would decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. The Council reiterated the EU’s adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, inter alia the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and all UN Security Council resolutions. It underlined its conviction that in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under SCR 1244, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles and resolutions.</p>
<p>As part of its comprehensive approach towards Kosovo the EU decided to launch, on 16 February 2008, a civilian mission, namely EULEX KOSOVO. The objective of the mission is to support the Kosovo authorities by monitoring, mentoring and advising on all areas related to the rule of law, in particular in the police, judiciary, customs and correctional services. This means that the mission will assist the institutions, and judicial authorities in their progress towards accountability and in further developing and strengthening an independent multi-ethnic justice system and multi-ethnic police and customs service. The key priorities of the mission are to address concerns regarding minority communities, corruption and the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p>Following the declaration of independence, buildings on two border crossings between Kosovo and Serbia were attacked. In some places ethnic Serbian members of the Kosovo police force and other bodies resigned in response. On 14 March a large group of protesters in the north of the Kosovo town of Mitrovica unlawfully occupied the UNMIK courthouse. UNMIK made attempts to persuade the protestors to vacate the building peacefully, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, on the authority of UNMIK, police action was initiated to retake the courthouse on 17 March. The operation passed off peacefully but the situation deteriorated when the police tried to take the protestors who had unlawfully occupied the courthouse away for questioning. Members of the UNMIK police force and KFOR were then attacked, including with lethal weapons. A Ukrainian member of the UNMIK police force subsequently succumbed to his injuries and more than ten policemen and KFOR soldiers were injured.</p>
<p>On 9 April 2008, the Kosovo Assembly adopted, in accordance with the declaration of independence, a constitution which had been certified beforehand by the International Civilian Representative. In it Kosovo undertook to comply with the provisions of the Comprehensive Proposal for Kosovo and other forms of international presence headed by the EULEX mission and the International Civilian Office (ICO), which will have a special supervisory role. The constitution will enter into force on 15 June 2008. The adoption of legislation on the protection of minority rights provided for in the Comprehensive Proposal is continuing.</p>
<p>With the exception of the events in Mitrovica in March, the situation in Kosovo is peaceful and devoid of significant ethnically motivated incidents. Even the local (and parliamentary) elections which the Republic of Serbia held, despite UNMIK warnings, in Kosovo on 11 May, in collaboration with certain groups of Kosovo Serbs, passed off peacefully in the main and with no major incidents. UNMIK declared the local elections unlawful and devoid of legal effect since they were held contrary to the exclusive mandate of UNMIK to certify elections under UN SCR 1244. Serbian parliamentary elections were also held in Kosovo.</p>
<p>As the UN Secretary General noted in his report in March, the majority of the Kosovo population showed restraint in the face of the reactions by a section of the Serbian population, and the Kosovo authorities have repeatedly called for calm, patience and trust in the international presence in Kosovo. Prime Minister Thaçi has made many visits to the Kosovo Serbs.</p>
<p>The Kosovo and international public are awaiting the entry into force on 15 June of the new Kosovo constitution, which the Kosovo Assembly adopted on 9 April, and the consequences that this will have for the reconfiguration of the international presence in Kosovo, in particular as regards the future role of the United Nations mission. Intensive talks on this matter are under way between all the interested parties and the international actors in Kosovo with a view to providing a clear plan for organising cooperation between UNMIK and the EULEX mission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0321"></a>

<p>However, if the Community is not responsible for these matters, as is certainly the case with respect to the possibility of criminal acts, as addressed in the question, the possibilities of EU intervention are limited to those available within the framework of EU instruments in the field of Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is aware of these articles, but it has not yet initiated the investigations mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>However, attention must be drawn to the fact that the Guardian article concerns an attempted breach of the EU’s control system in the context of exports to Iran. The article describes, in particular, the unsuccessful attempt by a British exporter to circumvent export controls in transporting second-hand goods to Iran via Malta (no permit is required for exporting second-hand goods from the United Kingdom to Malta, since this constitutes an intra-Community transfer). The Maltese authorities, quite rightly and in accordance with EU policy, prevented the attempt to transport the goods on to Iran. The UK successfully brought a case against the exporter, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for the attempted breach of the export control system. This example shows us that although the export control system operated by EU Member States has shortcomings, nevertheless it is robust and effective. In no way does the Guardian article draw attention to a successful attempt to breach the EU’s control system.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, UN, EU and national sanctions are prescribed for the export of arms and other relevant materials to Iran. In accordance with the first criterion of the European Union Code of Conduct on the export or transfer of arms, every state must respect international obligations, which also include the UN sanctions. The EU Member States have exclusive competence, in accordance with their national legal system, in respect of the punishment of legal and natural persons who violate these obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0324"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council emphatically condemns the harassment and murder of trade unionists and defenders of human rights, irrespective of where these acts take place and who commits them. The Council has acquainted itself with the additional resources that the Colombian Government has provided for the protection of human rights activists, witnesses, journalists, trade unionists and other persons at risk. Despite this, the attacks on this group of people continue.</p>
<p>In Colombia’s case, the Council has already drawn the attention of the state authorities to these problems a number of times, and discussed the subject with them. The leaders of EU missions discuss this issue regularly. In a collaborative political initiative taken by the leaders of EU Member State missions in Bogotá and their capitals, on 15 April 2008 a comprehensive dossier on the human rights situation in Colombia was handed over to the representative of the Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible for multilateral issues. On the day after submission of the dossier, the leaders of EU missions in Bogotá met representatives of the relevant non-governmental organisations, to discuss the current human rights problems. The EU will continue its activities to protect human rights. In addition, on 19 May a statement was agreed by the Presidency on behalf of the EU, which condemns the murders committed and death threats made against leaders of social organisations and human rights activists in Colombia in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the fact that for more than a year the Colombian Government has been engaging in regular dialogue with trade unionists, and has made additional resources available to protect them and also human rights activists, witnesses and journalists, with a view to regulating this alarming situation. Independent investigators and observers speak of a definite substantial improvement in general security and a marked decrease in all forms of criminality in Colombia. In view of the increase in threats and criminal acts in 2008, the European Council has called on the Colombian Government to do everything in its power to ensure that the Colombian populace and the organisations fighting to improve the human rights situation can represent their interests freely and without fear. Furthermore, the EU is calling on the Colombian Government to ensure that the perpetrators of violence, threats and murder are held to account irrespective of their status.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0330"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In order to obtain more detailed information, it might be better to approach the European Commission. The Council, for its part, wishes to draw the honourable Member’s attention to the many reports, studies and communications recently published by the Commission, which contain statistical and other data on the use and teaching of European languages. A new communication on multilingualism is expected from the Commission in autumn 2008.</p>
<p>We are expecting this report to take account of the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers of Education at this year’s May meeting. The decisions are based on the opinions expressed at the Ministerial Conference on Multilingualism, under the heading ‘Promoting linguistic diversity: our shared responsibility’, which was organised in Brussels on 15 February 2008 by the Ministry of Education and Sport of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Commission.</p>
<p>We are convinced that multilingualism in the EU can develop only on the basis of a balanced and stable position for all the EU’s official languages, irrespective of the number of speakers. The languages with greater numbers of speakers are often at an advantage as a result, because they are more emphatically supported on the wider market of the language industry, so that they are better equipped to meet the challenges of modern specialist language. In our view, the new multilingualism strategy at EU level should also tackle these issues. We are convinced that the joint recommendations to Member States to improve their language policy could also help to improve the situation of every mother tongue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0331"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 May part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is completely in agreement with the opinion of Johan Van Hecke MEP, namely that ethically acceptable business activities must be supported, and it is working to combat illegal activities in the EU and in our relations with partner countries. Thus sustainable development is the key element of EU development policy, and the European Consensus on Development, the policy statement signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 20 December 2005, clearly states that</p>
<p>the EU will help to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation, and in this way to promote employment and decent work for all;</p>
<p>the EU will lead global efforts to renounce consumption and production models that are not sustainable;</p>
<p>we shall help the developing countries to implement multilateral environmental agreements and support environmental initiatives on behalf of the poor;</p>
<p>the EU is wholly committed to action to improve the coherence of policy in the interests of development and of consideration for the goals of development policy in all policy fields that could affect the developing countries, including trade, the environment and the social dimension of globalisation, employment and decent work.</p>
<p>With regard to decent work, the Council Conclusions of 1 December 2006 on Decent Work for All stressed that the social partners, the business world and wider civil society must be included in initiatives supporting decent work, and called on companies and all other relevant players to promote decent work by means of action in the area of corporate social responsibility, i.e. action supplementing the rule of law and collective bargaining and taking account of internationally agreed standards, particularly those from the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention. The Council also supports the ILO’s Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, and the OECD initiatives promoting greater compliance with the OECD guidelines for multinational companies and the recommendations on employment and on relations between the two sides of industry.</p>
<p>The provisions on ethical government are the key element of our partnership agreements with third countries, particularly developing countries.</p>
<p>In the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries, responsible government is defined as transparent and responsible management of human, natural, economic and financial resources for the purposes of fair and sustainable development. The agreement also contains special provisions on tackling serious cases of bribery and corruption, and provisions on cooperation in environmental protection and the sustainable use and management of natural resources.</p>
<p>The aims of the strategic partnership between the EU and Africa agreed at the December 2007 EU-Africa summit include cooperation between Africa and the EU within the framework of international initiatives against illegal trade and the promotion of fair and transparent management of natural resources, confirming the Kimberley process; these include ‘Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade’ (FLEGT) and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Africa and the EU will also jointly address issues associated with combating bribery, corruption, forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, as well as other aspects of economic management. Within this framework, action has been taken to expedite audits and the return of illegally acquired assets and funds to the countries from which they came. The EU-Africa strategic partnership is already in operation, although it is being given shape by the first action plan for 2008-2010, which includes eight selected partnerships and priority measures.</p>
<p>The Cotonou Agreement and the EU-Africa partnership are being implemented in close cooperation with the partner countries, and in full compliance with the principle of autonomy.</p>
<p>To complete the picture, one more important element must be mentioned, namely the recruitment of staff from developing countries in accordance with ethical principles. In May 2007 the Council adopted the European programme for action to tackle the critical shortage of health workers in developing countries (2007-2013). In the context of its implementation, the Commission and Member States are currently examining the possibility of introducing an EU code of conduct on the recruitment of health workers, based on ethical principles and model methods from Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0336"></a>

<p>As the Honourable Member points out, the new provision in the Lisbon Treaty for the citizen’s initiative constitutes a major innovation in the Union’s institutional arrangements. For the first time, it will be possible for a million citizens from a significant number of Member States to call on the Commission directly to bring forward a proposal within the framework of its powers. It is, in effect, a new citizens’ right and it will strengthen democracy in Europe.</p>
<p>Procedural arrangements for the submission of a citizens’ initiative will be established by Parliament and the Council by means of a regulation on a proposal from the Commission, once the Lisbon Treaty has come into force.</p>
<p>The Commission would like the citizen's initiative to be operational very swiftly after the entry into force of the new treaty. Therefore, it intends to submit a proposal for a regulation setting the framework for the new citizens' initiative as quickly as possible after the new treaty comes into force. The Commission has already started some preparatory work in this respect and is in contact with the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Parliament on how best to proceed further. In preparing this proposal, the Commission will also listen to the views of all interested stakeholders.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0282"></a>

<p>Communicating with citizens about the Future of Europe in general is a duty of the Member States and the EU institutions. Member States have the main responsibility on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but obviously the Commission must stand ready to provide information and explanations to EU citizens.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty, and in particular its contribution to a more accountable decision-making and the clearer rules on Justice and Home Affairs and the RELEX<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> area, is one of the Commission's communication priorities for 2008. The Commission started to plan its communication efforts on the Lisbon Treaty as early as September 2007 by setting up a project team, which is responsible for the planning and the coordination of the communication. The Commission also launched a website dedicated to the Lisbon Treaty in the 23 official languages. The recent re-launch of the "Debate Europe" online forum<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> should also help citizens can discuss the Treaty and other issues on the Future of Europe.</p>
<p>Most communication activities of the Commission are based on a decentralised approach. The Commission Representations in Member States aim at providing basic and factual information on the Lisbon Treaty. The Representations in close cooperation with the Member States' governments and Parliament Information Offices have drawn up national communication plans in order to answer to the citizens' needs with tailor-made information.</p>
<p>These activities include training for journalists, information relays and multipliers, publication of brochures and leaflets, organisation of discussions with civil society and local authorities as well as actions at schools and universities.</p>
<p>As regards activities organized by the Commission Representation in Greece, the Representation invites all appropriate speakers, to the extent possible, in order to ensure the presence, excellence and in-depth knowledge of all of the groups mentioned in the question equally. The Representation is also actively encouraging the EUROPE DIRECT information relays to invite Honourable Members, to the extent possible, to attend their local events.</p>
<p>Within the global envelope of €11,4 million allocated to the Representations to cover expenditure on decentralised communication in 2008, an estimated budget of €2,7 million should be absorbed by actions that will mainly focus on the Lisbon Treaty. A detailed breakdown for all these activities which are all ongoing – including activities in Greece - will be available at the end of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This Commission has adopted a number of communication initiatives. These initiatives set out a long-term plan to reinvigorate communication of the European Union. These instruments also aim at helping the emergence of a European public sphere, where citizens are given the information and the tools to actively participate in the activities of the European Union and gain ownership of the European project. In this context, the Commission is also underlining the importance of a partnership approach between the EU Institutions and key stakeholders, including civil society.</p>
<p>The 2005 Action Plan<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ensures a more effective communication through a modern and more professional approach across all departments, including a more efficient organisation and a better use of both human and financial resources and communication tools and services.</p>
<p>Plan D<a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has stimulated a wider debate between the EU institutions and citizens. The recently adopted Communication on "Debate Europe"<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the follow-up to plan D, focuses on creating a citizens’ ownership of EU policies and on making the EU institutions accountable to them; on stimulating a wide and permanent debate on the future of the European Union between the EU institutions and people, both at national and EU level; on empowering citizens by giving them access to information so that they may be in a position to hold an informed debate on EU affairs.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the Commission's paper on "Communicating Europe in Partnership"<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> is to strengthen coherence and synergies between the activities undertaken by the different EU institutions and Member States, in order to offer citizens better access and a better understanding of the impact of EU policies at European, national and local level.</p>
<p>Answering to the high public interest in new technologies, the Commission adopted the internet strategy<a href="#defann_21_5" name="refann_21_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> in order to overhaul the EUROPA site – one of the biggest in the world, and to encourage interest in EU issues on other websites with a view to broadening the debate on the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission also adopted an Audio-Visual Strategy to facilitate a greater coverage of EU issues on existing and new audiovisual platforms; to encourage audiovisual media professionals to create and take part in European audiovisual networks, while retaining full editorial independence; and to increase the Commission's own production and dissemination of videos and documentaries to illustrate or explain EU policies.</p>
<p>Although these developments also depend on other factors, the standard Eurobarometer surveys carried out in spring and autumn 2007 show an increase in citizens' support for membership of the EU and trust in its institutions, compared to 2006.</p>
<p>Many of the recently adopted initiatives (EU radio network EuRaNet, Internet) are expected to deliver the bulk of their results in the months to come and the Commission’s communication strategy will thus focus on implementation in the near future.</p>
<p>The Commission is also working on new initiatives including setting up a TV network (as from 2009) and launching a call for proposals for Europe Direct information relays. New management partnerships with Member States will be in place as from 2008, and negotiations are underway to further extend the scheme in 2009. The Commission will also explore how best to contribute to the preparation for the European elections in 2009.</p>
<p>In order to assess and improve the effectiveness of its communication policy, the Commission has conducted around 30 evaluation studies since 2002, covering a wide range of activities (websites, information and communication relays, communication campaigns...). In line with standard Commission practice and the Action Plan, these evaluation efforts will continue and be reinforced in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are numerous indications that the Commission and Council are applying a strategy in their work to avoid anything which might strengthen the Irish people's scepticism towards the EU and thereby increase the likelihood of their voting against the Lisbon Treaty in the Irish referendum. The final date for 'general consultations' on the EU's long-term budget has now been moved from 15 April to 15 June. What is the reason for that?

<p>With its decision to launch a broad consultation on the budget review, the Commission has chosen a completely new and innovative approach to budget reform. Its objective is to stimulate a genuine Europe-wide debate beyond the institutional circles and build a new consensus about the future direction of EU finances.</p>
<p>This invitation for active involvement continues to trigger great interest across Europe. The Commission has received more than 200 replies so far and is receiving further contributions. The Commission has also been advised that some stakeholders are still in the process of formulating their positions.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, and to make sure that everyone wishing to contribute has the possibility to do so, it was decided to extend the consultation deadline by two months. This extension will have no bearing on the timing of the budget review. The invitation given to the Commission through the inter-institutional agreement setting up the financial framework 2007-2013 was to report within a timeframe of "2008-2009", and this timing will be respected.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to reiterate that it comes to the review without preconceptions and with a genuine wish to consult and debate about all arising issues.

Does it consider the protection of free competition and the consumer to be a legal asset of major Community importance which would allow the effective laying down of criminal penalties to punish the offences set out in the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 13 September 2005 in case C-176/03 (the Commission v the Council)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member refers in his question to the recent Commission White Paper on antitrust damages actions and the possibility of Community legislation to ensure effective redress for victims of competition law infringements. The Commission would like to use this occasion to stress the significance of these effective redress mechanisms that have to ensure that the victims of competition law infringements can be fully compensated for the harm they have suffered. To that end, the White Paper offers concrete suggestions to overcome existing hurdles to effective redress. The Commission hopes the Parliament will continue lending its support to this important initiative for European citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>As to the criminalisation of competition law, the Commission refers the Honourable Member to Articles 23 and 24 of Regulation 1/2003, according to which it can impose fines and periodic penalty payments on undertakings that violate the EC competition rules. Those sanctions are not of a criminal nature (see Article 23(5) of the said Regulation). According to Article 5, last indent, of that same Regulation, national competition authorities can impose "fines, periodic penalty payments or any other penalty provided for in their national law." Some Member States provide for criminal sanctions for breaches of EC competition law. While welcoming this type of sanctions, just as any other type of sanction that contributes to the deterrent effect on competition law infringements, the Commission has no current plans to take a legislative initiative that would aim at criminalising competition law infringements for the whole of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0323"></a>

<p>The settled practice of the Commission consists of classifying as aid tax schemes applicable in particular regions or territories which are favourable in comparison to the general scheme of a Member State, as was stated in the proceedings leading up to the Azores ruling.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member refers to the Azores case (C-88/03).</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to stress that with the said judgement, the Court upheld the 2003/442/EC decision by which the Commission had held that a 30% reduction of the company tax rate for companies established in the Azores, as opposed to the national tax rate applicable in Portugal, was a selective state aid. The Commission had concluded that the tax reduction provided an advantage to certain firms situated in a particular region of Portugal. For the Commission, the tax reduction was not justified under the Portuguese tax system because the said tax reduction was not available to other undertakings carrying out comparable investments or operations than the ones carried out by the beneficiaries in other areas of Portugal.</p>
<p>With the above mentioned decision, the Commission had also considered the question of whether the special fiscal status granted to the Azores region could justify the tax reduction in question. The Commission had however concluded that the reduction was not the expression of an effective fiscal autonomy by the Azores but it was rather an incentive by the central Portuguese Government to promote investments in the Azores. This also resulted from the constatation that the Azores tax reduction did not concern a system by which all local authorities in Portugal were allowed to set the rates of local taxes, but was rather an ad-hoc measure by which only the Azores could reduce the company tax rate set by the central Government by 30% so that the actual amount of the tax reduction was not decided by the Azorese but by the central Government.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member further inquires why the Commission does not recognise the fiscal authonomy of sub-national territories such as Scotland or the Basque Country while it regards Member States such as Luxembourg and Malta as independent national territories.</p>
<p>The Commission would first like to underline that Member States, however small they may be, can not be confused with regions, however autonomous these regions may be.</p>
<p>When applying the notion of state-aid to a tax measure, the Commission considers that the main criterion is to ascertain if the measure provides an exception to the application of the tax system in favour of certain undertakings in a Member State. The common system of reference should thus first be determined, whether local or central.</p>
<p>When reviewing local tax measures, the above determination shall be made in the light of the criteria set by the Court in the said judgement relating to the Azores. Most notably the Commission determines whether a measure was adopted by a body in the exercise of its autonomous powers and if the measure in question indeed applies to all the undertakings established in the territory or to all productions of goods on the territory coming within the competence of that body (point 62 of the judgement).</p>
<p>Finally, the notion of regional selectivity in tax measures will further be clarified in cases currently pending before the Court, notably concerning the Basque country (Cases C428/06 to C-434/06) and Gibraltar. The opinion of the Advocate general in the Basque Country case was issued on 8 May 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0320"></a>

<p>The European Commission learnt of alleged crimes of illegal trafficking of organs from the press, after the publication of a book by Mrs. Carla del Ponte, former Chief Prosecutor with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Such serious allegations cannot be ignored, but should be substantiated by facts.</p>
<p>The ICTY closed all its investigations at the end of 2004 without finding any reliable evidence for those allegations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission would suggest that all relevant materials, including those in the possession of the ICTY and of the Serbian authorities, should be forwarded to UNMIK<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and to the judicial authorities in Kosovo which should establish, in close cooperation with the Albanian authorities, if there are grounds for launching new investigations.</p>

<p>The Commission welcomes Parliament' support in the fight against organ trafficking and organ tourism as demonstrated by the "Organ donation and transplantation: policy actions at EU level" report, proposing a range of measures to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>Especially concerning organ trafficking, the Commission will closely monitor any developments both inside the EU and worldwide in collaboration with our international partners – the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation.

<p>It is extremely important that EU citizens should be made aware of the fact that the EU has a clear strategy on future enlargements. Discussion of the EU’s enlargement strategy in the European Parliament does not focus only on the strategy towards countries likely to join the Union, but also on EU policies aimed at countries with no prospect of accession, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Some people are calling for intermediate stages to be introduced between the ENP and the full enlargement process, others for closer cooperation between the Directorates-General Enlargement and External Relations.</p>
<p>Does the Commission take the view that the EU enlargement strategy should be kept strictly separate from policies which have a bearing on EU foreign policy as a whole, such as the ENP or the Barcelona Process: A Union for the Mediterranean? Or does it see a need for countries which are not yet ready for accession to be granted some form of intermediate status in the future?</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that the EU should rethink its enlargement strategy? Does it take the view that the EU enlargement strategy, which is essentially based on a series of stages leading to full membership (stabilisation and association agreement – applicant country status – accession negotiations – accession), is realistic?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU enlargement policy foresees membership as the ultimate goal for the countries concerned, and is therefore distinct from the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and, the Barcelona process: Union for the Mediterranean. Nonetheless, for an European country to participate in ENP or the Barcelona process does not prejudge its possible future accession perspective. Enlargement policy and ENP have a number of important principles in common as they both aim to enhance prosperity, stability and good governance and promote EU values in the countries neighbouring the EU. This is why the Commissioner in charge of Enlargement and his services cooperate closely with Commissioner in charge of External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy and her services in Directorate General Relex<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in developing and implementing these policies.</p>
<p>A further intermediate stage between the status of a potential candidate and accession does not seem opportune or useful. In this crucial year for the Western Balkans and Turkey, the Commission needs to be fair in applying the conditions while at the same time keeping our commitments on the membership perspectives of all countries involved in the process. Negotiations are ongoing with Croatia and Turkey with accession as their ultimate aim. In its 2005 strategy paper, the Commission outlined the consecutive steps for the Western Balkan countries on their way towards the EU.</p>
<p>The enlargement strategy is regularly reviewed in order to better address the challenges faced by the countries concerned and adapt to circumstances. This is done in particular in the annual enlargement strategy papers in which the Commission puts forward recommendations for policy adjustments. The Commission considers that the fundamentals set out in the renewed enlargement consensus agreed by Heads of State and Government in December 2006 remains valid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The humanitarian aid provided by the Commission to refugees and internally displaced persons in Chad will amount to EUR 30 million in 2008. Through the global plan for Chad, which is worth EUR 17 million, and the decision on food aid, worth EUR 13 million, the Commission is financing activities in the areas of health, water supplies, food aid and food security, protection, emergency shelter and education, which are being implemented by UN agencies, Red Cross organisations and international NGOs. With regard to food-aid operations under the World Food Programme (WFP) in Chad, the Commission contributed EUR 7 million in 2007 and that amount should rise to EUR 8.5 million in 2008.</p>
<p>The problem for the WFP in Chad is not, at this stage, a financial one. According to information supplied by the WFP itself, the emergency operation for eastern Chad currently has 75% of the funding it needs. The Commission has indicated its willingness to contribute a further EUR 7 million in food aid. To date, the WFP has not asked it to do so.</p>
<p>The WFP’s problem would seem to be more of a political and logistical nature, because the Libyan supply line (accounting for 37 000 million tonnes of food out of the 68 400 million tonnes that need to be pre-positioned) has been blocked over oil-tax issues. To speed up the delivery process, the WFP has opened a base at Faya Largeau, and the Commission has indicated its willingness to contribute EUR 1.5 million to the cost of that operation, but the WFP has not requested this funding.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that further delivery problems are likely to occur on the Cameroon supply line, where road transportation is shared by the WFP, EUFOR<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and MINURCAT.<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, it is hard to see the WFP’s problems in Chad in terms of financial constraints. At this stage, it is more a matter of logistical and organisational difficulties.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that it has a humanitarian commitment to tackle this crisis and it is in the process of considering the available options for meeting humanitarian needs not currently covered by the WFP. It also confirms that it is willing to seek out the funding that the WFP requires, once it has been requested to do so.</p>
<p>With a view to strengthening the Commission’s role as an observer and facilitator of the agreement of 13 August 2007, its programme includes provision, under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Instrument for Stability, for financial and logistical support for the electoral process. This assistance is intended to ensure that free and fair parliamentary elections can be held at the end of 2009 – a key objective of the agreement of 13 August 2007.</p>
<p>On the question of the armed political opposition, the Commission is encouraging application of the recent Dakar agreement, which addresses relations between Sudan and Chad. Applying that agreement would help to bring about a ceasefire involving all the rebel forces, thus creating scope for a comprehensive dialogue to achieve reconciliation in Chad.</p>
<p>Like France and the International Organisation for the French-Speaking World, the Commission has observer status on the National Commission of Inquiry set up to examine the events of early February 2008 and the subsequent disappearance of opposition leaders. The Commission has already noted an acceptance by the Chad authorities of its wishes concerning the objectivity and impartiality of that body, and it will do all it can to ensure that these values prevail in the approach taken by the National Commission of Inquiry and in its findings. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Can the Commission give a statement on the effectiveness of the system, given that the deliberations of the 133 Committee are not made public and, as a result, the talks appear to be taking place away from public scrutiny?

<p>Title IX, Part III, of the EC Treaty (Articles 131 to 134) establishes a Common Commercial Policy. Article 133 provides that the Commission submits proposals to the Council for implementing that policy, and conducts negotiations with other States or international organisations in consultation with a special committee appointed by the Council to assist the Commission in this task. This Committee – the "Article 133 Committee" – thus assists the Commission in the conduct of the negotiation of trade agreements and gives advice to the Commission on the Common Commercial Policy. All Member States are participating on a weekly basis to this Committee where they are informed of ongoing issues and can react and voice their support and/or concern. The Committee is chaired by the rotating presidency and meets in the Council building.</p>
<p>The 133 Committee provides an important platform for policy advice and for enabling the Commission to get a good overview of Member States' views. It does not adopt legally binding positions on Commission proposals, or take formal decisions within the meaning of Article 249 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>When a formal act is required (for example, the authorisation to open negotiations), this is proposed by the Commission and then decided upon by the Council of Ministers, customarily in the General Affairs and External Relations Council and in principle by qualified majority. Unanimity is required in the areas of audiovisual services, education, transport, culture and health, services or commercial aspects of intellectual property when the trade agreement includes provisions for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules). However, the Commission works hard to forge a consensus on all important issues. This is necessary in order to ensure smooth handling of the issues at the Council, but also to have a coherent and fully endorsed Community line for trade negotiations being pursued or under preparation: the Community is stronger when united. On all occasions, therefore, the Commission tries hard to take into account the concerns or sensitivities of all Member States, seeking a satisfactory middle way that would reflect the Community interest rather than to isolate individual Member States.</p>
<p>The role of the Parliament remains limited under the current Treaty. However it is an established practice by the Commission to inform the Parliament on an equal footing with the Council, through the INTA committee<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Furthermore, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Lisbon Treaty will increase the powers of the Parliament in trade matters with the extension of the co-decision for legislative acts and the systematic use of consent procedure for international agreements.</p>
<p>The Common Commercial Policy allows the 27 Member States of the EU to speak with one voice on the international stage. This gives the EU, the world's largest trading block, a very strong role in international trade. The international mechanisms of coordination and decision ensure the legitimacy and accountability of the Commission's negotiating positions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2004 the Commission submitted a proposal for a Directive on 'introducing humane trapping standards for certain animal species'<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the purpose of implementing obligations and commitments arising from an international Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards signed by the EC, Canada and the Russian Federation and an agreed minute on the same subject with the United States of America. These obligations and commitments involve the introduction of harmonised trapping standards for the purpose of improving the welfare of trapped animals. These harmonised trapping standards described in the proposal cover also snares used for the trapping of the 19 animal species listed in the Agreement. The intention with the introduction of the trapping standards applicable also for snares was to ban the use of inadequate and inhumane traps.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a Directive was, however, rejected for a variety of reasons by the Parliament during the first reading. These reasons included lack of most recent scientific results as the basis of the proposal, lack of EC-competence to deal with the welfare of wild animals, calls for the application of the subsidiarity principle with regard to the implementation in the EU of the humane trapping standards, general criticism towards the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards, requests fore more freedom to address national and regional concerns with regard to trapping, requests for more benefits with regard to animal welfare and calls for an impact assessment.</p>
<p>To address concerns of the Parliament such as the scientific basis for the proposed standards and the impact assessment, the Commission launched a study on the description of the state of the art of research, science and application of humane trapping standards referred to in the “Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards” and described in Commission proposal in view of identifying the improved trapping standards which reduce unnecessary pain, distress and suffering of trapped animals as much as technically possible. Accordingly, an important task of the study contract is to identify those traps, including snares, which reduce unnecessary pain, distress and suffering as much as possible and which are selective. In the light of the results of the study which are expected in the first half of 2009, the Commission will decide on possible further measures to address this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission understands corporate social responsibility as signifying the voluntary inclusion by companies of social and environmental concerns in their commercial activities and their relations with their stakeholders. Companies behave in a socially responsible way when they go further in meeting social needs than the minimum legal requirements and the duties imposed by labour agreements. It is not, therefore, Commission policy to have a directive on the subject of corporate social responsibility. Nonetheless, if companies respect the principles of social responsibility, they will treat their employees fairly in the process of coping with industrial change. The same applies in relation to the proper use of aid from public funds.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the negative impact that corporate restructuring can have on the workers affected, on their families and on the regions concerned. However, it is not up to the Commission to express a view in such cases or to interfere in corporate decision-making, unless European law has been broken.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are various provisions in European law to secure workers’ rights in the event of restructuring.

The Commission would remind the House that it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to apply those directives properly and effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a number of new initiatives, which are likely to be adopted in the near future, to encourage socially responsible management of change and restructuring – following on from its communication of 2005<a href="#defann_33_4" name="refann_33_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on that subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In connection with the separation of network operators from suppliers of electricity and gas (EU Directives 2003/54/EC<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 2003/55/EC<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), the question arises how Member States levy value added tax (VAT) for the operations of the separated network operators and suppliers. Some use the 'agent' model, which means that the supplier (the undertaking which transmits the energy) is required to collect VAT for the whole chain and pass it on to the tax authorities. Where this customary model is applied, the VAT payable by the supplier and his 'supplier' (the network operator) can be processed independently. However, if this model is not (or is no longer) permitted, the amounts of VAT which the supplier quotes on invoices to customers for the transmission service must correspond precisely to the amounts of VAT which the transmitting undertaking invoices for the particular customer. The supplier must explicitly quote on the invoice VAT on transmission as a separate item from the VAT on its own service. This mutual dependence of the supplier and transmitter is particularly troublesome to the businesses concerned in the event of a default on payment, change of address by the customer or switch to a new supplier.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm that, following the separation of network operation and supply, the above 'agent' model is permitted on the basis of the EU law in force?

This means where the energy supplier acts in his or her own name and on behalf of the network company transmitting the energy the customer can receive a single invoice from the energy supply covering both the supplies of the energy supplier and those of the network company.</p>
<p>Neither the electricity Directive 2003/54/EC nor the gas Directive 2003/55/EC currently in force contain any provisions or guidelines on taxation issues, which are out of their scope.

The communication on protecting critical communications and information infrastructures is one of these priority initiatives. In addition to this initiative, whose objective is to ensure suitable and coherent levels of protection and flexibility for critical information infrastructures in order to guarantee continuity of service, can the Commission state what other measures, including legislative actions, it has in mind between now and June 2009 with a view to increasing the security of communications networks and computer systems?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question raised by the Honourable Member related to a fundamental issue, the enhancement of the security of information and communications networks and systems.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Commission presented its proposals for EPCIP, the European Programme on Critical Infrastructure Protection. The Communication setting out the overall approach was accompanied by a proposal for a Directive on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures. The Directive is currently being discussed in the Council.</p>
<p>EPCIP introduces a sector-specific approach to Critical Infrastructure Protection. What the Commission announced in its Commission Legislative Work programme for 2008, and will present in 2009, will be the ICT sector specific policy to ensure a high level of security and resilience of critical communication networks and information infrastructure - like Internet - and to guarantee continuity of services. The initiative will aim at improving preparedness and response capability at EU level building on National and private sector activities. The objective will be to engage relevant public and private stakeholders so that adequate and consistent levels of preventive, detection, emergency and recovery measures are put in operation.</p>
<p>This initiative follows a number of other important measures related to network security recently proposed by the Commission. Firstly, in the context of the legislative proposals to reform the regulatory framework of eCommunications<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, measures are proposed to enable all stakeholders, including telecom operators and regulators, to respond faster and in a more coordinated way to security breaches and malicious attacks. More precisely, decision-makers would have to be better informed about the actual level of network security in order to be able to make better policy choices. There would have to be greater clarity as to the security measures that telecoms operators take to ensure that the networks and services they provide are secure, reliable and resistant to security breaches. In addition, service providers that suffer security breaches would have to tell their customers when their personal data has been compromised so as to allow them to take the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>Secondly the Commission has proposed an immediate extension of the duration of ENISA's<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> mandate that would give sufficient time for an in-depth debate on the future of network and information security at Community level, the extension being without prejudice to the outcome of this debate.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission has just launched a number of research projects in the area of Secure and trustworthy network and service infrastructures under the "Information and Communication Technologies" (ICT) theme of the EU's 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research &amp; Development running from 2007 to 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission fully shares the opinion of the Honourable Member on the crucial importance of new innovative technologies for achieving the objectives for carbon dioxide emission reductions by 2020. A transparent and non-discriminatory European standardisation system is of course a sine qua non for these goals, as well as for continuous efforts to safeguard the large innovative potential of European Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It is essential that this system works efficiently also for them, quite like the Commission has emphasised in its recent Communication on Standardisation and Innovation<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission however shares the concern that SMEs should be better represented in the work of national and European Standardisation Organisations and has already started to address the issue.</p>
<p>Within the more specific context of the revision of the Construction Products Directive<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (CPD), the Commission has recently adopted a proposal for a Regulation to replace the CPD. In this proposal, the procedures currently coordinated by EOTA<a href="#defann_37_4" name="refann_37_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> will be thoroughly restructured, with a view to considerably simplifying them, making them more transparent and also enabling the manufacturers to play a decisive role in them. In addition, new and stricter criteria are to be brought in place for the designation of the technical assessment bodies, carrying out the practical work. Apart from clarifying the current system, all these changes are aimed precisely at increasing the accessibility of the system, especially for SMEs, and consequently for strengthening its overall credibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the context of the 2003 CAP reform, the decoupling of direct payments from production can be expected to strengthen further the competitiveness of the sector.</p>
<p>Short-term policy adjustments in the CAP have acted on limits that have been imposed on agricultural production. Compulsory set-aside from arable production has been set at zero for the 2008/09 marketing year and milk quotas will be increased by 2%, as from 1 April 2008.</p>

<p>In the framework of the EU Drugs Strategy for 2005-2012, the Commission is currently drafting a proposal for a new EU Drugs Action Plan for 2009-2012, which will incorporate new policy actions reflecting new challenges regarding the trafficking of drugs into the EU.</p>
<p>Internally, the EU has set up a wide range of actions to combat drugs related organized crime i.a. via Europol<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (projects MUSTARD<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, COLA<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, SYNERGY<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>), Eurojust, the Police Chiefs Task Force (COSPOL<a href="#defann_41_5" name="refann_41_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> projects), Joint Investigation Teams, and new Joint Customs Operations on drugs.</p>
<p>The Commission also financially supports the reinforcement of the cooperation between law enforcement authorities of Member States, concerning the fight against heroin trafficking along the Balkans route to the European Union (COSPOL projects, Joint Custom Operations and Joint Investigation Teams).</p>
<p>Externally, the EU is cooperating on a bilateral and regional basis with third countries to address the drug problem and has become a major actor at international level. Considerable funding is being devoted to drug supply control. In addition, mention should also be made to the assistance provided to third countries to reinforce their capacities for border management and combating organised crime.</p>
<p>In this framework, particular importance is being attached to the main (heroin/cocaine) trafficking routes supplying the EU. The following examples give a more concrete indication about the types of current activities funded by the Commission in the field of drug law enforcement and intelligence exchange:</p>
<p>In order to address the increasing cocaine trafficking to the EU via West Africa, the Commission co funds (€800.000) the UNODC<a href="#defann_41_6" name="refann_41_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Project to Promote Intelligence Sharing between Latin America and the Caribbean and West Africa. The project will last 3 years, is based in Colombia and Dakar and receives the assistance, inter alia, from an EU police officer.</p>
<p>Another running project (€875.605) funded under the previous North/South Drugs Budget Line is the EU-Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Drugs Intelligence Sharing Working Group (ISWG) - the mechanism of intelligence exchange between the participating countries in the EU-LAC Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism on Drugs implemented by United Kingdom FCO<a href="#defann_41_7" name="refann_41_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. It is a regular forum where representatives from law enforcement agencies and the judiciary of the EU and LAC countries adopt best practices in the sharing of operational intelligence aimed at targeting the trafficking of illicit drugs through the LAC region and between LAC and the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission also attaches particular importance to addressing the challenge posed by drug trafficking along the Balkan Route and various projects to strengthen the capacities of the countries concerned are launched under the different geographical financial instruments.</p>
<p>Different initiatives are being developed to increase co-operation among EU Member States in the field of drug supply reduction:</p>
<p>Under the Prevention of and Fight Against Crime Programme the Commission has provided €661.000 grant to Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N), based in Lisbon. It is a seven EU Member States initiative which matches up-to-the-minute intelligence with military and law enforcement assets to provide a rapid response to drug traffickers attempting to supply of cocaine to the EU. Its core focus is on non commercial vessels and aircraft, primarily from the South American and West African regions. The Commission has an observer status since 1 January 2008.</p>
<p>Some similar regional initiatives are evolving in other regions like the Mediterranean basin. The European Commission has also provided €95.000 for a Conference on a French initiative similar to MAOC-N but aimed specifically at traffic through the Mediterranean (CECLAD-M).</p>
<p>In the framework of the programming 2009/2011 for the Instrument for Stability the Commission envisages in particular to address the fight against trafficking along the cocaine and heroin routes. These initiatives would aim at providing a trans-regional and comprehensive response and by developing synergies and solutions towards the strengthening of the EU internal and external security.</p>
<p>Confiscation of assets</p>
<p>The Action Plan for the Hague Programme says that the Commission will review and, where appropriate, propose an instrument to strengthen present EU legislation on confiscation of criminal assets. The Commission is planning a Communication on the proceeds of crime for the autumn of 2008. This Communication will focus on the policy action which could strengthen the legislative framework and procedures for the confiscation and recovery of the proceeds of crime in the European Union. This Communication will be underpinned by the results of a study analysing Member States' practices in criminal confiscation, which will focus on what has proven to be effective at national level with a view to promote and exchange best practice.</p>
<p>As part of this process, in December 2007 the Commission issued an implementation report on the Council Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA on Confiscation of Crime-related Proceeds, Instrumentalities and Property, which showed that most Member States are slow in putting in place measures to allow more widespread confiscation.</p>
<p>The Commission is also supporting the implementation of Council Decision 2007/845/JHA on cooperation between Asset Recovery Offices in the Member States, which should allow the fastest possible identification and tracing the proceeds of crime. For example in March 2008 the Commission co-financed a High Level Conference on the establishment of Asset Recovery Offices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The merchant vessel Don Pedro, belonging to the company Iscomar, sank in the port of Ibiza on 12 July 2007. Severe damage has been caused to the ecosystem owing to the rupturing of the vessel’s fuel tank and escape of fuel oil and mineral oil, and the subsequent dense tar-like spillages on three of the island’s beaches, which had to be closed for several days. The Spanish Government ordered the leaks detected in the wreck of the vessel to be sealed, but in late August 2007 fuel oil started to reappear, after several storms had lashed the island, as did new patches of fuel, thereby causing further environmental damage in the natural park protected area. The vessel has still to be refloated and lies in 43 metres of water, with all the threats of pollution that entails.</p>

<p>Peace and stability are crucial preconditions for the development of Colombia. Past, present and future EC policy towards Colombia therefore focuses on securing support for the establishment of a solid and sustainable basis for peace. This objective has been furthered notably through the EC’s cooperation programme for Colombia. The Country Strategy Paper 2007-2013 allocates 70% of overall funding under the first National Indicative Programme (2007-2010) to the area of peace and stability.</p>
<p>Current EC support to the 3 peace laboratories – which are much appreciated by all actors (central government, departments and municipalities, parliament, civil society) – will continue until 2009 for the first two, and until the 2010-2011 for the third laboratory. Thereafter, a new programme, to be committed later in 2008, is to take the relay.</p>
<p>This € 28 million programme, entitled “Regional development for peace and stability”, will further consolidate ongoing processes already being implemented through the existing peace laboratories. It will also prepare the ground for, and allow a transition towards, a potential future EC-supported action which applies the approaches developed successfully in the framework of the peace laboratories at a more systemic, ideally nation-wide level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0327"></a>

<p>On 19 April 2008, large-scale strawberry farmers and their henchmen carried out a murderous attack at Nea Manolada, Ilia, on migrant agricultural workers taking part in strike action and on members of PAME (the All Workers Militant Front) and the KKE (Communist Party of Greece) who were demonstrating in support of their just struggle. The indulgence and, effectively, support shown by the police and judicial authorities towards the strawberry farmers was provocative.

<p>The Commission cannot take a position on events of which it has only heard through the press. However, beyond this specific event the Honourable Member refers to, the Commission rejects any violence and exploitation of immigrants, regardless of their legal status. Member States must ensure that fundamental rights are effectively respected, and thus protect human life and the integrity of persons.</p>
<p>The EU´s common immigration policy is committed to a comprehensive approach that deals with all aspects of migration flows. Legal migration should be governed by clear, transparent and fair rules. At the same time, strong measures are needed to prevent and reduce illegal immigration.</p>
<p>It is long-standing policy that legally staying and working migrants should enjoy the same socio-economic rights as own nationals of that Member State. The 2003 Directive on long-term residents and the recent proposal for a framework Directive on migrant workers legally residing in a Member State are examples of this approach.</p>
<p>As announced in its 2005 policy plan on legal migration, the Commission will soon present a proposal for a Directive on conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers. The proposal will contain, amongst others, provisions on certain rights of seasonal workers, such as the right to non-discrimination with regard to working conditions, including levels of pay.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU needs to fight more vigorously illegal immigration and undeclared work, as these do not only undermine the possibilities to manage legal migration, but also often lead to exploitative working conditions for the persons concerned. This is a complex phenomenon with multiple drivers, and so must be the responses.</p>
<p>In this context it is important to mention the Commission’s proposal for a directive providing for sanctions against employers of third-country workers who are illegally staying in the EU. The proposal aims to contribute to reducing illegal immigration. Under the proposal, Member States would introduce similar preventive measures and penalties against the employers, and enforce them effectively. Penalties should include fines and other administrative sanctions. There should also be criminal penalties in serious cases, such as where illegally staying third-country nationals have been employed under particularly exploitative working conditions.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that those proposals on both illegal and legal migration will be adopted soon, as stronger EU legislation can help prevent situations like the one to which the Honourable Member refers to.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0329"></a>

<p>Responsibility for child protection, including assistance for children with special needs, such as mentally disabled children, and their families, lies with the Member States. The Commission is therefore not in charge of specific measures to assist children with special needs and their families in their efforts to secure the establishment and consolidation of public infrastructure meeting present-day needs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is not and has never been indifferent to the situation of children with special needs and their families. In this area the Commission supports the action of the Member States, in great measure through the interventions of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Financial help through the European Social Fund, the promotion of access to quality support and care services, awareness-raising activities and the establishment of platforms for exchange of good practice are among the tools the EU uses to promote social inclusion of children with special needs and their families.</p>
<p>Also, the European Regional Development Fund, through the operational programmes it co-funds under the Third Community Support Framework for Greece (2000-2006), provided financial assistance to projects aiming at supporting people with special needs, including children. To mention only the most notable examples, measure 5.1 of the operational programme "Education and Initial Professional Training 2000-2006" is devoted exclusively to the improvement of the physical infrastructure of educational facilities for pupils with special needs, with a total public budget of € 7,629,562.</p>
<p>Similarly, operational programme "Health and Welfare 2000-2006" funds several projects supporting groups with special needs, including rare and severely disabling diseases, such as childhood cancers. For instance, one such project entails the procurement of radiotherapy equipment for children, intended for use at the P. &amp; A. Kyriakou Children's Hospital in Athens (total public budget of €7 million). Finally, most of Greece's thirteen regional operational programmes include measures devoted to the improvement of healthcare infrastructure and the promotion of social support services, which may also fund actions for people with special needs, including children.</p>
<p>Additionally, under the fourth programming period (2007-2013) of the Structural Funds, all of Greece's five regional operational programmes include priority axes devoted to the improvement of citizens' quality of life, which will fund, among other, infrastructure and services of health and social care, including relevant actions for people with special needs.

<p>In June 2003 the European Commission launched the European Road Safety Action Programme with the aim of reducing the number of victims of road accidents in the European Union by half over the period to 2010. Following the submission of an interim assessment of the programme, in its resolution of 18 January 2007 (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2007-0009_EN.html">P6_TA(2007)0009</a>) Parliament drew attention to the dangers involved in driving under the influence of drugs.</p>
<p>In October 2006 the European Commission launched the four-year project DRUID (Driving under the influence of drugs, alcohol and medicines) with a view to investigating this problem.</p>
<p>These initiatives highlight the dangers involved in driving under the influence of drugs and the importance of measures to reduce drug use.</p>
<p>Have the investigations conducted as part of the DRUID project produced (interim) results?</p>

<p>The DRUID (‘Driving under the influence of drugs, alcohol and medicines’) research project receives around EUR 19 million in financial support from the Commission – approximately 80% of its overall budget. The project is coordinated by the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) and involves 37 partner research bodies from some 20 EU Member States.</p>
<p>Its main aims are to advance research into the effects of drugs on the nervous system and on people’s ability to drive, and to develop research into more effective means of roadside testing for drug use, drawing on the findings of the Rosita II project,<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which was undertaken jointly by the EU and the USA.</p>
<p>It would thus be premature at this stage to make definite proposals for specific activities in relation to drugs testing for drivers, because the devices currently available are not reliable or effective enough. However, when the DRUID project – which is to run over four years – delivers its final conclusions in October 2010, it should produce detailed solutions in that regard.</p>
<p>Between now and 2010 – and I think this will answer the Honourable Member’s first question – interim results will be published on the project website.<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

They were also acquired on behalf of the museum and became the property of the Ministry of Culture.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the cultural and architectural heritage should be protected and that architectural historical continuity should be preserved in an area such as this one in the vicinity of the Acropolis, an historic monument of worldwide importance directly associated with the history of the city?

<p>Is the Commission planning to verify the border checks carried out in Spain with a view to preventing any repetition of cases such as the sunflower-oil one which jeopardise food safety?

<p>The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) received on 23 April 2008 a notification from the competent authorities of France concerning the presence of mineral oil in sunflower oil originating from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Investigations as regards the source of contamination are still ongoing but the contamination is possibly linked to the fraudulent addition of mineral oil to crude sunflower oil.</p>
<p>Given that the presence of mineral oil in sunflower oil is linked to fraud, such a contamination is not predictable. It is therefore very difficult to prevent such contaminated oil entering the food chain, even with a strict control system in place.</p>
<p>However, following the finding of the mineral oil in sunflower oil originating from Ukraine, the Commission asked the authorities from Ukraine to guarantee for all future consignments the absence of unacceptable levels of mineral oil in sunflower oil based on sampling and analysis.</p>
<p>The Commission asked the competent authorities from the Member States to control all consignments of sunflower oil originating from Ukraine on the presence of mineral oil before release on the market.</p>
<p>Also a reinforcement of the controls on the presence of mineral oil in all vegetable oils imported into the EU was requested.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FEDIOL, representing the EU vegetable oil industry, made the commitment to check all imported consignments of vegetable oils of all origins for the presence of mineral oil.</p>
<p>These measures should minimize the risk that such a contamination could occur again.</p>

<p>In late April the German media reported that experts in the governing CDU/CSU and SPD coalition parties had agreed to the extension until 2011 of the transitional period for access to the German labour market by nationals of the new Member States. The decision was confirmed by Olaf Scholz, the Minister for Labour within the German Government. Everything therefore points to it soon being endorsed by the German Government as a whole.</p>
<p>Such a decision by the largest EU Member State, Germany, which is at the same time calling for the swift entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which states, in the common provisions, that the Union 'shall combat (...) discrimination', would be a clear instance of labour-market discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>

<p>The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that under the Accession Treaties the Member States are entitled not to grant free access to their labour markets to workers from some of the Member States that joined in 2004 and 2007 and this does not constitute discrimination contrary to EC law.</p>
<p>The transitional arrangements set out in the Accession Treaties of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 allow the other Member States temporarily to restrict the fundamental freedom to move to other EU Member States by making access to labour markets by workers from the Member States that joined recently subject to national law. The fact that these workers are treated differently from other EU workers does not amount to discrimination contrary to EC law on the basis of nationality: the EC Treaty prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality, but without prejudice to special Treaty provisions, such as the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaties.</p>
<p>A Member State that restricts access to its labour market must nevertheless comply with the conditions set out in the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaties. The overall transitional period of seven years is divided into three phases (2+3+2 years) and different conditions apply during each phase: during the first and second phases, it is for each Member State to decide whether or not to open its labour market to workers from those countries.</p>
<p>In principle, however, restrictions on access to the labour market will end after these first two phases, i.e. five years after accession (on 30 April 2009 as regards workers from the Member States that joined in 2004). Restrictions may continue to apply for a further two years after that date only where there is a serious disturbance of the labour market, or threat thereof, and the Commission must be notified of this before the end of the fifth year after accession.</p>
<p>From 30 April 2009, therefore, the Member States may no longer decide on their own discretion to continue to restrict access to their labour markets until 2011, and the Commission will fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties in ensuring compliance with the conditions set out in the Accession Treaties. In addition, as the transitional arrangements constitute a derogation from a fundamental freedom and since the conditions for derogations from fundamental freedoms must be interpreted strictly, the Commission expects the Member States to provide a high level of evidence of a serious disturbance of the labour market, or a threat thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
