<p class="contents">Before we start the debate, it is definitely appropriate to mention that today can and will be a decisive day for Europe. I am not exaggerating when I say to you that people throughout the world are watching the European Union today. This morning they will undoubtedly be watching Germany, where the German constitutional court is making a decision which will be important for all of us. They will also be watching the elections in the Netherlands, where our fellow citizens will be electing a new parliament this morning, with far-reaching effects on the European Union as a whole, and I believe you share my view of this. People all over the world will be watching this Parliament, where the President of the Commission will be giving his State of the Union address.</p>
<p class="contents">Before he does that, I would like to make one comment as President of this Chamber. Developments over the last few months have given cause for concern, in particular with regard to the tendency towards deparliamentarisation in Europe. At this point and before Mr Barroso gives his speech, I would like to make it quite clear that anyone who thinks that the parliamentary process is too slow, who says that parliaments are an obstacle to the development of new and necessary structures and who believes that European bodies with European powers can be established without involving the European Parliament will, I am sure, encounter determined opposition from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Mr Barroso’s speech this morning, we will hear proposals for the creation of a new instrument in Europe: the banking union. One thing is absolutely clear. Regardless of which new structures are introduced in Europe, the euro is the currency of the Union. This is the Parliament of the Union. On the basis of this logic, the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has different ideas will meet with powerful resistance from this Parliament. I have said powerful resistance, because the European Parliament is a powerful institution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, President of the Council, honourable Members, it is an honour to stand before you today to deliver this third State of the Union address, although at a time when the European Union continues to be in crisis – a financial and economic crisis, a social crisis, but also a political crisis, a crisis of confidence. At its root, the crisis results from irresponsible practices in the financial sector, unsustainable public debt, and also a lack of competitiveness in some Member States. On top of that, the euro faces structural problems of its own. Its architecture has not been up to the job. Imbalances have built up.</p>
<p class="contents">This is now being corrected but it is a painful and difficult effort. Citizens are frustrated. They are anxious. They feel their way of life is at risk. The sense of fairness and equity between Member States is sometimes being eroded. Without equity between Member States, how can there be equity between European citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last four years, we have made bold decisions to tackle the systemic crisis. But despite all these efforts, our responses have not yet convinced citizens, markets or our international partners. Why? Because, time and again, we have allowed doubts to spread – doubts over whether some countries are really ready to reform and regain competitiveness, doubts over whether other countries are really willing to stand by each other so that the euro and the European project are irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">On too many occasions, we have seen a vicious spiral. First, very important decisions for our future are taken at European summits. But then, the next day, we see some of those very same people who took those decisions undermining them, saying either that they go too far or that they do not go far enough. Then we get a problem of credibility and a problem of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable to present these European meetings as if they were boxing events, claiming a knockout victory over a rival. We cannot belong to the same union and behave as if we do not. We cannot put at risk nine good decisions with one action or statement that raises doubts about all we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This reveals the essence of Europe’s political crisis of confidence. If Europe’s political actors do not abide by the rules and the decisions they have set themselves, how can they possibly convince others that they are determined to solve this crisis together?</p>
<p class="contents">A crisis of confidence is a political crisis. The good thing is that in a democracy there is no political problem for which we cannot find a political solution. That is why, here today, I want to debate with you the fundamental political questions – where we are now and how we must move forward. I want to focus on the political direction and the vision that will inspire our policy decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I will not list all these individual decisions. You are receiving the letter I addressed to the President of the European Parliament, and that sets out the Commission’s immediate priorities. We will discuss them with you before adopting the Commission work programme later in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to you today is this: Europe needs a new direction. And that direction cannot be based on old ideas. Europe needs a new way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak about the crisis – and we are all speaking about the crisis – have we really drawn all the consequences for our action? When we speak about globalisation – and we all speak a lot about globalisation – have we really considered its impact on the role of each of our Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for new thinking for Europe is to really draw all the consequences of the challenges that we are facing and that are fundamentally changing our world. The starting point is to stop trying to answer the questions of the future with the tools of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the start of the crisis, we have seen time and again that interconnected global markets are quicker and therefore more powerful than fragmented national political systems. This undermines the trust of citizens in political decision-making and it is fuelling populism and extremism in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that, in an interconnected world, Europe’s Member States on their own are no longer able to effectively steer the course of events.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But, at the same time, they have not yet equipped their Union – our Union –with the instruments needed to cope with this new reality. We are now in a transition, in a defining moment. This moment requires decision and leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, globalisation demands more European unity. More unity demands more integration. More integration demands more democracy – European democracy. In Europe, this means, first and foremost, accepting that we are all in the same boat. It means recognising the commonality of our European interests. It means embracing the interdependence of our destinies and it means demanding a true sense of common responsibility and solidarity because, when you are on a boat in the middle of the storm, absolute loyalty is the minimum you demand from your fellow crew members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way we will keep up with the pace of change. It is the only way we will get the scale and efficiency we need to be a global player. It is the only way to safeguard our values – because it is also a matter of values – in our changing world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 20<span class="sup">th</span> century, a country of just 10 or 15 million people could be a global power. In the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, even the biggest European countries run the risk of irrelevance between global giants such as the US or China. History is accelerating. It took 155 years for Britain to double its GDP per capita, 50 years for the United States, and just 15 years for China. But, if you look at some of our new Member States, the economic transformation going on is no less impressive.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has all the assets it takes – in fact much more so than previous generations faced with similar or even greater challenges. But we need to act accordingly and mobilise all these resources together. It is time to match ambitions, decisions, and actions. It is time to put a stop to piecemeal responses and muddling through. It is time to learn the lessons from history and write a better future for our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What I demand, and what I present to you today, is a decisive deal for Europe – a decisive deal to project our values, our freedom and our prosperity into the future of a globalised world; a deal that combines the need to keep our social market economies on the one hand and the need to reform them on the other; a deal that will stabilise the EMU, boost sustainable growth, and restore competitiveness; a deal that will establish a contract of confidence between our countries, between Member States and the European institutions, between the social partners, and between the citizens and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive deal for Europe means that we must leave no doubt about the integrity of the Union or the irreversibility of the euro. The more vulnerable countries must leave no doubts about their willingness to reform and about their sense of responsibility. The stronger countries must leave no doubts about their willingness to stick together and about their sense of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must all leave no doubts that we are determined to reform and to reform together.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that we can grow without reform or that we can prosper alone is simply false. We must recognise that we are in this together and we must resolve this together. This decisive deal requires the completion of a deep and genuine economic union, based on a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with Europe’s economy. Firstly, we need growth, sustainable growth. Growth is the lifeblood of the European social market model. It creates jobs and supports our standard of living. But we can only maintain growth if we are more competitive. At the national level it means undertaking structural reforms that have been postponed for decades – modernising public administration, reducing wasteful expenditure, tackling vested interests and privileges, reforming the labour market to balance security with flexibility and ensuring the sustainability of social systems.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European level, we need to be more decisive about breaking down barriers, whether physical, economic or digital. We need to complete the single market. We need to reduce our energy dependence and tap the renewable energy potential. Promoting competitiveness in sectors such as energy, transport or telecoms could open up fresh competition, promote innovation and drive down prices for consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will shortly present a Single Market Act II. To enable the single market to prosper, the Commission will continue to be firm and intransigent in the defence of its competition and trade rules. Let me tell you frankly that, if this is left to the Member States, they will not resist pressure from big corporations or large external powers.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create a European labour market and make it as easy for people to work in another country as it is at home. We need to explore green growth and be much more efficient in the use of resources. We have to be much more ambitious about education, research, innovation and science.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a world leader in key sectors such as aeronautics, automotives, pharmaceuticals and engineering, with global market shares above a third. Industrial productivity increased by 35% over the last decade, despite the economic slowdown. Today some 74 million jobs depend on manufacturing. Every year start-up firms in the EU create over 4 million jobs. We need to build on this by investing in our new industrial policy and creating a business environment that encourages entrepreneurship and supports small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">This means making the taxation environment simpler for businesses and more attractive for investors. Better tax coordination would benefit all Member States. We also need a pro-active trade policy by opening up new markets. This is the potential of Europe’s economy. This is the goldmine that is yet to be fully explored. Fully implementing the Growth Compact agreed at the June European Council can take us a long way.</p>
<p class="contents">And we could go further with a realistic yet ambitious European Union budget dedicated to investment, growth and reform. Let us be clear: the European budget is the instrument for investment in Europe and growth in Europe. The Commission and this Parliament, indeed all pro-European forces – because most Member States support our proposal – must now stand together in support of the right multiannual financial framework that will take us to 2020. It will place little burden on Member States, especially with our proposed new own-resources system but it would give a great boost to their economies, their regions, their researchers, their students, their young people who seek employment, and their SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a budget for growth. It is a budget for economic, social and territorial cohesion between Member States and within Member States. It is a budget that will help complete the single market by bridging gaps in our energy, transport and telecoms infrastructure through the Connecting Europe Facility. It is a budget for a modern, growth-oriented agriculture capable of combining food security with sustainable rural development. It is a budget that will promote a research-intensive and innovative Europe through Horizon 2020 because we need this European scale for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come, as a test of credibility, to many of our Member States. I want to see if the same Member States that were always speaking about the need for growth and investment for growth will now support the budget for growth at European level.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This budget is also the tool to support Europe 2020, our strategy for growth, which we need now more than ever before. Europe 2020 is indeed the way to modernise and preserve the European social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our agenda of structural reform requires a major adjustment effort. It will only work if it is fair and equitable because inequality is not sustainable. In some parts of Europe we are seeing a real social emergency with rising poverty and massive levels of unemployment, especially among our young people. That is why we must strengthen social cohesion. It is a feature that distinguishes European society from alternative models.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that because of the crisis the European social model is dead. I do not agree. Yes, we need to reform our economies and modernise our social protection systems, but an effective social protection system that helps those in need is not an obstacle to prosperity. It is indeed an indispensable element of it. Indeed, it is precisely those European countries with the most effective social protection systems and with the most developed social partnerships, that are among the most successful and competitive economies in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairness and equity mean giving a chance to our young people. We are already doing a lot. Before the end of the year the Commission will launch a Youth Package that will establish a youth guarantee scheme and equality framework to facilitate vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairness and equity also mean creating better and fairer taxation systems. Stopping tax fraud and tax evasion could put extra billions into the public purse across Europe. This is why the Commission will fight for an agreement on the revised Savings Tax Directive and on mandates to negotiate stronger savings tax agreements with third countries. Their completion would be a major source of legitimate tax revenues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to fight for a fair and ambitious Financial Transaction Tax that will ensure that taxpayers benefit from the financial sector, not just that the financial sector benefits from taxpayers. Now that it is clear that agreement on this can only happen through enhanced cooperation, the Commission will do all it can to move this forward rapidly and effectively with those Member States that are willing. This is about fairness. Fairness is an essential condition for making the necessary economic reforms socially and politically acceptable and, above all, because fairness is a question of social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the crisis, important decisions have been taken. Across the European Union, reform and consolidation measures are being implemented. Joint financial backstops are being put in place, and the European institutions have consistently shown that they stand by the euro. The Commission is very aware that in the Member States implementing the most intense reforms, there is hardship and there are – sometimes very painful – difficult adjustments, but it is only through these reforms that we can come to a better future. They were long overdue. Going back to the status quo ante is simply impossible. The Commission will continue to do all it can to support those Member States and to help them boost growth and employment, for instance through the re-programming of structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a word on Greece. I truly believe that we have a chance this autumn to come to the turning point. If Greece banishes all doubts about its commitment to reform – but also if all the other countries banish all doubts about their determination to keep Greece in the euro area – we can do it. I believe that if Greece stands by its commitments it should stay in the euro area as a member of the European family.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Securing the stability of the euro area is our most urgent challenge. This is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the Community Institutions. The ECB cannot, and will not, finance governments. But, when monetary policy channels are not working properly, the Commission believes that it is within the mandate of the ECB to take the necessary actions, for instance in the secondary markets of sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the ECB has not only the right but also the duty to restore the integrity of monetary policy. It is of course for the ECB, as an independent institution, to determine what actions to carry out and under what conditions. But all actors – and I really mean all actors – should respect the ECB’s independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken about the economic policy measures that we must implement as a matter of urgency. This is indispensable. But it is not sufficient. We must go further. We must complete the economic and monetary union. We must create a banking union and a fiscal union and the corresponding institutional and political mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Commission is presenting legislative proposals for a single European supervisory mechanism for the euro zone. This is a stepping stone to banking union. The crisis has shown that, while banks became transnational, rules and oversight remained national. When things went wrong, it was the taxpayers who had to pick up the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past four years the EU has overhauled the rulebook for banks, leading the world in implementing the G20 commitments. But mere coordination is no longer adequate – we need to move to common supervisory decisions, namely within the euro area. The single supervisory mechanism proposed today will create a reinforced architecture, with a core role for the European Central Bank, and appropriate articulation with the European Banking Authority, which will restore confidence in the supervision of the banks in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a supervision for all euro area banks. Supervision must be able to look everywhere because systemic risks can be anywhere, not just in so-called systemically relevant banks. Of course, this is in a system that fully engages the national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">The package comprises two legal texts – one on the ECB and the other on the EBA – which go together. It is clear that Parliament will have a crucial role to play in the adoption of the new mechanism, and after that in its democratic oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a crucial first step towards the banking union I proposed before this House in June. Getting the European supervisor in place is the top priority for now because it is the precondition for the better management of banking crises, from banking resolution to deposit insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel the Commission will continue to work on the reform of the banking sector, to make sure it plays its role in the responsible financing of the real economy. That means improving long-term financing for SMEs and other companies. It means rules on reference indices, so that we do not again see the manipulation of bank interest rates affecting companies and mortgage holders alike. It means legislation to ensure that banks give a fair deal to consumers and another look at the structure of banking activities to eliminate inherent risks.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of this, the role of this Parliament is essential. The Commission endeavours to work in close partnership with you.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a second element of a deeper economic union. It is the move towards a fiscal union. The case for it is clear: the economic decisions of one Member State impact on the others, so we need stronger economic policy coordination. We need a stronger and more binding framework for the national decision-making for key economic policies, as the only way to prevent imbalances. While much has been done here – for instance through the six pack and through the country-specific recommendations – further steps are crucial to combine specific conditions with specific incentives and to really make the economic and monetary union sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">To deliver lasting results, we need to develop a fully equipped Community economic governance, together with a genuine, credible Community fiscal capacity. We do not need separate institutions or to create new institutions for that, quite the contrary. For this to be effective and quick, the best way is to work with and through the existing institutions: the European Commission as the independent European authority, overseen by the European Parliament as the parliamentary representation at European level. It is in such a framework that, over time, steps for genuine mutualisation of debt redemption and debt issuance can take their place.</p>
<p class="contents">So economic reform coupled with a genuine economic and monetary union are the engines to get our boat moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will publish a blueprint for deepening the economic and monetary union, already this autumn. This blueprint will be presented to this House because these questions must be discussed with and by the representatives of the people. At the same time, it will inform the debate at the December European Council that will be prepared by the report that the President of the European Council, I myself and the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Euro Group have been asked to present.</p>
<p class="contents">Our blueprint will identify the tools and instruments and present options for legal drafting that will give effect to them, from policy coordination to fiscal capacity to debt redemption. Where necessary – as in the case of jointly and severally guaranteed public debt – it will identify the Treaty changes necessary because some of these changes require modifications in the Treaty. It will present a blueprint for what we need to accomplish, not only in the next few weeks and months but also in the next years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, the credibility and sustainability of economic and monetary union – the credibility of our currency, the euro – depends on the institutions and the political construct behind it. This is why the economic and monetary union raises the question of a political union and the European democracy that must underpin it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want economic and monetary union to succeed, we need to combine ambition and proper sequencing. We need to take concrete steps now, but with a political union as the horizon. I would like to see the development of a European public space, where European issues are discussed and debated from a European standpoint. We cannot continue trying to solve European problems just with national solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has to take place in our societies and among our citizens. But today I would also like to make an appeal to European thinkers, to men and women of culture, to join this debate on the future of Europe. We need them. I also make this appeal to you. This is the house of European democracy. We must strengthen the role of the European Parliament at European level. We need to promote genuine complementarity and cooperation between the European and national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">This also cannot be done without strengthened European political parties. Indeed, we very often have a real disconnect between political parties in the capitals and the European political parties here in Strasbourg. This is why we have to recognise that the political debate is cast all too often as if it were just between national parties. Even in the European elections we do not see the name of the European political parties in the ballot box. We see a national discussion between national parties. This is why we need a better statute for European political parties. I am proud to announce that the Commission has adopted a proposal for this today.</p>
<p class="contents">An important means to deepen the pan-European political debate would be the presentation by European political parties of their candidate for the post of Commission President at the European Parliament elections in 2014. This can be done without a Treaty change and would be a decisive step to make the possibility of a European choice offered by these elections even clearer. I call on the political parties to commit to this step and thus to further Europeanise the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A true political European Union means we must concentrate European action on the real issues that matter and must be dealt with at European level. Let us be frank about this. Not everything can be a priority at the same time. We need to be more selective and here some self-criticism will probably apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper integration is about taking a fresh look at where the most appropriate level of action is. Subsidiarity is an essential democratic concept and should be practised. A political union also means that we must strengthen the foundations on which our Union is built: respect for our fundamental values, for the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months we have seen threats to the legal and democratic fabric in some of our European states. The European Parliament and the Commission were the first to raise the alarm and played the decisive role in seeing these worrying developments brought into check. But these situations also revealed the limits of our institutional arrangements. We need a better developed set of instruments – not just the alternative between the ‘soft power’ of political persuasion and the ‘nuclear option’ of Article 7 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment to upholding the rule of law is also behind our intention to establish a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, as foreseen by the treaties. We will make a proposal soon.</p>
<p class="contents">A political union also means doing more to fulfil our global role. Sharing sovereignty in Europe means being more sovereign in a global world. In today’s world, size matters and values make the difference. That is why Europe’s message must be one of freedom, of democracy, of the rule of law and of solidarity. In short, our values, the European values.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever our citizens and the new world order need an active and influential Europe, not just for us here in Europe. It is important for the rest of the world that we succeed. A Europe that stands by its values and a Europe that stands up for its belief that human rights are not a luxury for the developed world but should be seen as universal values.</p>
<p class="contents">The appalling situation in Syria reminds us that we cannot afford to be bystanders. A new and democratic Syria must emerge. We have a joint responsibility to make this happen and to work with those in the global order who also need to give their cooperation towards that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The world also needs an EU that keeps its leadership of development and humanitarian assistance, that stands by open economies and fights protectionism and that leads the fight against climate change. The world needs a Europe that is capable of deploying military missions to help stabilise the situation in crisis areas. We need to launch a comprehensive review of European capabilities and begin truly collective defence planning. Yes, we need to enforce our Common Foreign and Security Policy and to have a common approach to defence matters because together we have the power and the scale to shape the world into a fairer, rules-based and human-rights-abiding place.</p>
<p class="contents">A deep and genuine economic and monetary union, a political union with a coherent foreign and defence policy, means ultimately that the present European Union must evolve. Let us not be afraid of the word: we will need to move towards a federation of nation states. This is our political horizon. This is what must guide our work in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I call for a federation of nation states. Not a superstate. A democratic federation of nation states that can tackle our common problems, through the sharing of sovereignty in such a way that each country and its citizens are better equipped to control their own destiny. This is about union with the Member States, not against the Member States. In the age of globalisation pooled sovereignty means more power, not less.</p>
<p class="contents">I said a federation of nation states on purpose because I think that, in these turbulent times, in these times of uncertainty, it would be a real mistake to leave the defence of the nation just to the nationalists and populists. I believe in a Europe where people are proud of their nations but also proud to be European and proud of our European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating this federation of nation states will ultimately require a new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not say this lightly. We are all aware how difficult Treaty change has become. It has to be well prepared. Discussions on Treaty change must not distract or delay us from doing what can and must already be done today.</p>
<p class="contents">A deep and genuine economic and monetary union can be started under the current treaties, but can only be completed with changes in the treaties. So let us start it now but let us have the horizon for this future present in our decisions of today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not begin with Treaty change. We must identify the policies we need and the instruments to implement them. Only then can we decide on the tools that we lack and the ways to remedy this.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there must be a broad debate all over Europe. A debate that must take place before a convention and an IGC are called. A debate of a truly European dimension. The times of European integration by implicit consent of citizens are over. Europe cannot be technocratic, bureaucratic or even diplomatic. Europe has to be ever more democratic and the role of the European Parliament for this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European elections in 2014 can be so decisive. Before the next European Parliament elections in 2014, the Commission will present its outline for the shape of the future European Union. We will put forward explicit ideas for Treaty change in time for a true European debate. We will set out the objectives to be pursued, the way in which the institutions that can make the European Union more open and democratic, the powers and instruments to make it more effective, and the model to make it a union for the peoples of Europe. I believe we need a real debate and in democracy the best way to debate is to debate our future and our goals in the elections at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a debate for the euro area in its present membership. Let me be very clear. In Europe we need no more walls dividing us because the European Union is stronger as a whole in keeping the integrity of its single market, its membership and in its institutions. No one will be forced to come along and no one will be forced to stay out but the speed will not be dictated by the slowest or the most reluctant.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our proposals will be based on the existing Union and its institutions – on the Community method. Let us be clear – there is only one European Union, one European Commission, one European Parliament. More democracy, more transparency, more accountability, is not created by a proliferation of institutions that would render the European Union more complicated, more difficult to read, less coherent and less capable of acting.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the magnitude of the decisions that we will need to make over time. That is why I believe we need a serious discussion between the citizens of Europe about the way forward – and also about the possible consequences of fragmentation, because sometimes through unintended consequences we get fragmentation that we do not want – but also about what we could achieve if leaders avoid national provincialism: what we can achieve together.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use the 2014 election to mobilise all pro-European forces. We must not allow the populists and the nationalists to set a negative agenda. I expect all those who call themselves Europeans to stand up and to take the initiative in this debate. Because even more dangerous than the scepticism of the anti-Europeans is the indifference or the pessimism of the pro-Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, what we need is a decisive deal to complete the EMU, based on a political commitment to a stronger European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The sequence I put before you is clear. We should start by doing all we can to stabilise the euro and accelerate growth in the EU as a whole. The Commission will present all the necessary proposals – we have started today with the single supervisor – to create a banking union, in line with current treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will present our blueprint on a deep and genuine economic and monetary union, including the political instruments. This will be done this autumn. We will present here again all proposals in line with the current treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, where we cannot move forward under the existing treaties, we will present explicit proposals for the necessary Treaty changes ahead of the next European parliamentary election in 2014, including elements for reinforced democracy and accountability. This is our project, a project that is step by step but with a big ambition for the future, with a federation as the horizon for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that many will say that this is too ambitious and that it is not realistic. But I want to leave you with some questions. Let me ask you – is it realistic to go on as we have been doing? Is it realistic to see what we are seeing today in many European countries? Is it realistic to see taxpayers paying banks and afterwards being forced to give banks back the houses they have paid for because they cannot pay their mortgages? Is it realistic to see more than 50% of our young people without jobs in some of our Member States? Is it realistic to go on trying to muddle through, just trying to accommodate mistakes with unconvincing responses? Is it realistic to think that we can win the confidence of markets when sometimes we show so little confidence in each other?</p>
<p class="contents">To me, it is this reality that is not realistic. This reality cannot go on.</p>
<p class="contents">The realistic way forward is the way that makes us stronger and more united. Realism is to put our ambition at the level of our challenges. Realism is to tell our youth that, yes, there is hope if we stick together. If there is a bias in our analysis, let it be a bias for hope. We should be proud to be Europeans, proud of our rich and diverse culture. In spite of our current problems, our societies are among the most human and free in the world. We do not have to apologise for our democracy or for our social market economy or for our values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With high levels of social cohesion, respect for human rights and human dignity, equality between men and women, respect for our environment – these European societies, with all their problems, are among the most decent societies in human history. I think we should be proud of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In our countries two or three girls do not go to prison because they sing songs criticising the leader of their country. In our countries people are free and proud of that freedom and people understand what it means to live in freedom. In many of our countries, namely the most recent Member States, there is a recent memory of what was dictatorship and totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous generations have overcome much bigger challenges. Now it is for this generation to show they are up to the task. Now is the moment for all Europeans to leave business as usual behind and to embrace the business of the future. The European Union was built to guarantee peace but today this means making our Union fit to meet the challenges of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a new thinking for Europe, a decisive deal for Europe. That is why we need to guide ourselves by the values that are at the heart of the European Union. I believe that Europe has a soul and this soul can give us the strength and the determination to do what we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">You can count on the European Commission. I count on you, the European Parliament, because together, as Community institutions, we will build a better, stronger and a more united Europe, a citizens’ union for the future of Europe and also for the future of the world.</p>

<p class="contents">We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European.</p>
<p class="contents">To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports.</p>

In some areas I would like to see things being taken further and I will also be explaining where we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would go further. You have declared your support for the European social model and rightly so. I would have liked to have seen more support for the social model from those on the right, because it is very much at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">You have assured us of your commitment to Europe’s role in the world, which must be a strong role. That is also the right thing to do. Yesterday, Mr Goebbels reported on a meeting in Asia. The Asian representative began his speech with the words: ‘we from the emerging countries and you Europeans from the submerging countries’. That is the image that Europe, at least in part, is presenting today. We all agree that we want Europe to continue to belong to the emerging countries and regions. However, if we do not change our economic policy, this will not happen. If we see the economic crisis only as a crisis in state spending – you presented it in more differentiated terms, but many others on the right see it in this way – and, therefore, if we believe that it is simply about cutting services, then we will not emerge from the crisis. In fact, we will end up in an even deeper recession. The Portuguese Prime Minister made this quite clear. If you start with an extreme austerity policy, you end up having to reach even deeper into people’s pockets. We do not want that. We do not want the poorest people in Europe to become even poorer. That is not a policy that we in the S&amp;D Group can support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I have said to you on many occasions that the troika is unfortunately contributing to this recessionary policy. The troika should instead be focusing on fundamental reforms of decrepit structures, which is what we need. However, if the troika believes that we can get out of this mess simply by making cuts, I would like to know where all its successes have been. Every forecast based on measures recommended by the troika has had to be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Spain – and the foreign minister and the minister for Europe are sitting here, our former colleagues, even if they are chatting to one another – unemployment has risen from 11% to 24%, a world record for comparable countries, and sovereign debt has increased from 40% to 81%. Is that supposed to be a success? The troika is unsuccessful, because it has the wrong solutions, because it is not investing in growth and because it is not familiar with the concept of ‘demand’ as a stimulus for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul, you mentioned Mr Dombrovskis. Has Mr Dombrovskis told you how many well-trained people have left Latvia, the other Baltic states and the countries in the south because they cannot find jobs? This is what is called success, when unemployment levels are high and those who are affected are exported. Where are the people of Europe supposed to emigrate to if we all end up in a recession? Mozambique, Angola, Brazil and other countries will not be big enough.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest. The policy has failed. The only institution that has stepped into the breach at the moment is the European Central Bank (ECB). Not that I am happy with all its measures. However, if we did not have the ECB, we would be in a much deeper mess. If we did not have a man like Mr Draghi at its head, but instead had a man like Mr Weidmann, the catastrophe in Europe would be much more serious.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We politicians are facing a challenge. There is an alternative which, most importantly, must lead to investment. Mr Barroso, in the US public investment is increasing. In China public investment is increasing. In Japan public investment is increasing. What is happening in Europe? How can we go on talking about competitiveness, if we are no longer investing? You are on our side when it comes to the question of tax increases and tax evasion. If we only received a quarter of the tax revenue which we lose every year in Europe through tax evasion, by means of transfers to Switzerland and other tax havens, we could increase public investment in Europe by 40%. That is our problem.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we agree with you. To ensure that the financial markets do not react as dramatically as they have done, we need stronger regulation which is targeted in particular at high-frequency trading. We definitely need measures to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion. I am calling once again on Austria and Luxembourg finally to give the Commission a mandate for negotiations with Switzerland. We also need the financial transaction tax. A motion has still not been submitted to the Commission. I agree with you about the banking union and the supervision of the banks. We must not prop them up again using taxpayers’ money. We need a budget that stimulates growth. We are on your side. I want to be very clear about one thing. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of a European budget that makes no contribution to growth. We are strongly opposed to attempts to cut the budget even further for populist reasons. It is already small enough and many regions need this budget.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are particularly concerned about is the disregard for the social question. This does not just affect the poor countries. If we look at youth unemployment and how fast it is growing, it is clearly not only a problem for the countries on the periphery. Do the ladies and gentlemen in this House know that one in every five workers in Germany, good old wealthy Germany, is a low-paid worker? Are the ladies and gentlemen on the right who do not belong to the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) aware that Ms von der Leyen, their minister, wanted to take extensive measures to combat old-age poverty, but was prevented from doing so by her own party and has now had to go to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and ask for help? That is the reality: poverty, old-age poverty and youth unemployment are all things which are extremely serious problems in the peripheral countries in the south, but which are gradually also reaching the wealthy countries like Germany. Germany is also sliding into recession. One third of Germans are worried about social exclusion. That is today’s Europe. If we want to defend Europe, it should not be a Europe like this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a scandal that the paper produced by Mr Van Rompuy contains nothing about the social issues. You will probably agree with this, Mr Barroso, but I am calling on you to take action. The questions which concern most people in Europe today, in other words, unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, are not even mentioned in Mr Van Rompuy’s paper. Therefore, I am calling for a chapter in the paper on social issues. On behalf of my group, I am also calling for a social pact, because the ladies and gentlemen on the right of this House are very keen on having a fiscal compact. I agree. With great difficulty and only as a result of pressure from the new French Government, we have a growth pact, a weak one, but a growth pact all the same. However, a social pact is apparently not important to you at all. We need a social pact to combat the decline in solidarity in Europe, youth unemployment and old-age poverty and to promote the integration of our foreign and immigrant fellow citizens. There are many social questions in Europe and, therefore, my group would like to have a social pact at last, not only a weak growth pact and not only a stringent fiscal pact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament has also touched on the issue of democracy which has been put at risk by the mismanagement of the many financial markets. Sovereignty is in jeopardy, but national sovereignty is not threatened by Europe. However, democracy is definitely also at risk, because we are seeing antidemocratic tendencies developing. As the Council takes on more and more responsibility, in particular for budget issues, I would like to know who the Council is accountable to for its actions. At a national level it is the individual Heads of State or Government. Mr Van Rompuy is notable for his absence from this House. We rarely see him and generally only after the event, when he explains what has happened or more often what has not happened. This is an unacceptable trend. We want the Council to be fully accountable, particularly to this House, because parliamentary democracy at a European level is part of democracy as a whole. It is an essential component of democracy. The Council should not take upon itself responsibilities and powers which it is not entitled to. That is a violation of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Some journalists in the German and Austrian media rightly regard the Council as a bastion of nationalism. I understand your concept of a federation of nation states. However, Mr Barroso, it must be clear that we are fighting together to ensure that the individual countries hand over to Europe the powers needed to allow us to defend our sovereignty jointly in today’s and tomorrow’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we also need a new treaty. However, if we tell the people who are currently unemployed that we have no jobs for them and, at the same time, begin discussing a new EU treaty, at best, they will fail to understand us and, at worst, they will resort to violence. Therefore, we need to proceed with caution. First of all, we must have a European debate. We discussed this yesterday with some of the foreign ministers, who are working on a paper. We need a European debate on the goals of the future Europe. We have a great deal in common in this area. Then after the next elections we can organise a convention. When we know where we want to go, this convention can also, and I would like to make this quite clear, decide on a new constitution and not on an amendment to the treaty. We finally need a European constitution, but only after we have solved our current problems. That is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Barroso, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work closely together with us. If we fight side-by-side to achieve a Europe of employment, of social cohesion and of democracy, then we will be on the right track. We do not have a lot of time until the next elections. We need to make changes in Europe. We must join together to combat the decline in solidarity and to fight against nationalism, which represents a threat to us. We can all be proud of our national flags, but if the European flag does not fly next to the British flag, then it is wrong to fly the British flag. If the European flag is there, then the British one can be as well, because it is the concept of a shared Europe that links us together.</p>

<p class="contents">But what we are seeing today is more of a deep political crisis. Everybody is talking about public finances, about interest rates, about economics. In my opinion it is not about Greece, it is not about the public finances, it is not even about economics as being the fallout of the crisis. The real nature of this crisis is a political one and that is the political incapacity today to make the jump forward to a federal union and, more precisely, the incapacity of the national elites of Europe to make this jump to a more federal union in Europe. That is the real crisis we are going through today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am saying that, Mr Barroso, because you have made a whole speech, but at the end of the speech you come up with a concept and that concept we cannot accept: a federation of nation states. No, no federation of nation states, that is more of the same, we have that already – that is the European Council, which is a federation of nation states where the Heads of Government and the Heads of State were trying to solve and are incapable of solving this crisis. We do not want more of the same – we do not need a nationalistic or a national future for Europe. We need a post-national future for Europe. That is what we need. What we need for Europe is not a federation of nation states: it is a federal union of European citizens. It is about citizens and it is not about nation states in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maybe Mr Barroso is going to tell us that he is in fact going to turn the federation of nation states into a federal union. Then we will certainly have unanimity in the Chamber today. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, even after the decision of the Constitutional Court – I am always a little bit critical when we talk about the Constitutional Court, as if there were no constitutional courts in other EU countries for the moment, but maybe in the future we can give them as much attention as we have given to Karlsruhe – there are still three remarks to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it is not the European Central Bank that will solve the crisis. The European Central Bank can help; the European Bank has done the unavoidable in that for the third time already – after Trichet with SMP, after the LTRO – Draghi has bought us time again. But this is a stop-gap solution; this is not a structural solution to this crisis and it is a mistake to think in this House that, if the ECB comes in, then our problems are over. No, our problems are only over if we have the courage to create the federal union that is so desperately needed. Do not think that this new measure of Draghi can work for more than five or six months. The crisis will come back if we do not assume responsibility – that is my second remark today, dear colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We all know what the solution is. We all know – besides a number of individuals on the other side of the plenary – that we need an economic union, we need a political union, we need a fiscal union. We all know that is the solution. I find it unthinkable that we are still waiting to come forward with proposals and what are we doing, in fact? Waiting for the outcome of the German elections or something like that, because that is the political reality for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress that I think it is very good, Mr Barroso, that today you have introduced a proposal for a single financial supervisor, which is one of the three building blocks for a banking union. But what I do not understand is why the Commission is not also taking the initiative on the other building blocks that are needed to solve this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We desperately need a resolution mechanism for the banks. The establishment of an economic government and a treasury in Europe: we need it desperately, if we want to solve the crisis. The mutualisation of debt by the establishment of redemption funds: even the chief of the German <span class="italic">Sparkasse</span> last week said – and he is the former Minister of Finance in Bavaria, a good member of the CSU – that it is absolutely necessary that we have a redemption fund if we want to solve this crisis. Furthermore he, the chief of the whole <span class="italic">Sparkasse</span> in Germany, has asked the European Commission to take the initiative in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />So my question to you, Mr Barroso, is why these two standards? If the European Council in June was asking you to come forward with a proposal for a banking union within two months – and that is a good thing – why is Mr Barnier not putting forward a proposal for a banking union? If this Parliament has already asked the Commission four times, in the Two-Pack and in the resolutions, to come forward with a redemption fund, which is a real structural solution to this crisis, why do we receive nothing at all? Why is the European Council more important than the European Parliament when you come forward with your own initiatives? Why?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are in a balanced Union. You have the Council and you have Parliament. If Parliament requests that you come forward with a package of legislative proposals to end this crisis, it is your obligation and duty to do that. We are still waiting. We are still waiting for, I do not know what, perhaps the green light from Berlin or from of Paris before you take action in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me finally to my third point, the proposal that we have on the table today, which is the creation, the establishment of a single financial supervisory authority by giving more powers to the European Central Bank. I have to tell you, Mr Barroso, I think it is a good idea that we have that, because we need a single supervisor. But I have some question marks on the model that we are choosing today because, let us be honest, what we are doing is mainly copying the <span class="italic">Banque de France</span>. In most of our countries – in Britain it is the case, in Belgium, in the Netherlands and in Germany too – you have a split between a monetary authority on the one hand and financial supervision of banks on the other. I cannot understand why we cannot merge the three institutions that we have today into what we call a financial supervisory agency or authority, so that we do not mix a financial supervision task with a monetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I see a number of possible conflicts today: euro zone banks versus non-euro zone banks; banks versus other financial institutions. I see a problem between the ECB and the EBA. The EBA is creating the roadmap and the ECB is applying the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see a problem on democratic accountability, because democratic accountability is not compatible with the independence of the Bank. So my proposal to you, Mr Barroso, is to look further into that question and also to change the legal basis. My proposal and suggestion to you and Mr Barnier is not only to use Article 127 as a legal base, but also Article 114, so that we have full codecision with Parliament on such an important matter in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So I conclude, Mr President, but I have a little more time as you interrupted me in the beginning of my speech – with good news, so there is no criticism from my side. I think it is absolutely necessary now, Mr Barroso, that not only do we hear a good speech from you but that you put forward a whole package of legislative proposals in the way Parliament wants. Because do not forget that your legitimacy comes from this House, from this Parliament, and it is also this House that can take it back.</p>

Mr Barroso, when you talk of crisis, do not forget the ecological crisis, the environmental constraints, which you failed to mention in your description of the crisis today. We are facing a poly-crisis, a number of crises, and the ecological crisis is one of the most important crises, along with the financial and economic crisis and the democratic crisis. If you were to rework this speech, be sure to add this in.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Barroso, you said: ‘Europe needs a new way of thinking, it needs a new direction’. Yes, but if we want to take a new direction, we will need a compass. In what direction do we want to go? This is where the debate between Mr Lamberts and Mr Verhofstadt is interesting, because we do need to be honest. I agree with Mr Verhofstadt when he says that the Council and governments have been unable to come up with responses to the crisis. They have been hedging their bets. We are going to help Greece, a little, a lot, passionately, madly, not all … We never knew what the true position of governments was. Even today, we do not know. It is true, then, that the Council is incapable. Yet, Mr Verhofstadt, Parliament is also incapable, the European institutions are also incapable. When Parliament was not capable of voting for the development of transnational lists for the next elections, it clearly showed us that it is not up to the debate that we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Back to the compass, then. I am absolutely convinced that Europe now needs to be federalised. I do not agree with what you have picked up from Jacques Delors, a federation of nation-States. Yes, we need a post-national Europe which is not just a federation of states. That is what we need in Europe. Obviously, in a Senate, a second chamber, the States will play an important role in European legislation, but what is unacceptable today is that we have a Council that acts as executive and legislator at the same time. That is no longer possible. Montesquieu would be turning in his grave. A legislator cannot be an executive and an executive cannot be a legislator. We must denounce this for the sake of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the budget, Mr Barroso. You are right, but, come on, be honest. We must use our compass to stay on the course towards federalisation. I would like to give those of you, here, that do not know it, some information. When the US federal budget was set up by Roosevelt, in 1932, it was 1% of US GDP. In 1945, it was 7% of GDP. In 2012, it is 23% of GDP. As long as the EU budget represents only 1% of European GDP, well, we cannot have meaningful European social policy. It will definitely not work.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that in the next five years, the EU budget should rise from 1% to 5% of the European gross domestic product. That is the real debate that needs to be had with the nation States. This increase must be achieved using our own resources. It is not through national contributions, the very embodiment of national self-interests, that we will manage to build Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put this simply. Mr Barroso, you spoke of flexicurity. Having a flexible labour market with secure working conditions is obviously right. Take a country like Greece, where unemployment has reached astounding levels. Do you believe that, if we were to now organise a flexible labour market, like the one you want, this country can pay for the security? If we now want flexicurity for some poor countries, whether that is Greece, Spain Italy or any other country with a serious unemployment crisis, they will need support for that security, and that will have to come from the EU budget. Otherwise, we will not succeed and nor will they. If you want there to be a genuine social pact, for Europe to have the means to help those States who are not able to provide security, like the United States can do with their budget, well, we will not achieve this with 1%, and not even with the amount proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If we grab the compass today and steer Europe into the right direction of federalisation, we can give Greece the social redemption fund immediately. We need to ultimately tell Greece the truth. The truth is that you can still have an adjustment policy, but that is it. We need to be honest and open. Greece obviously needs more time; we will obviously need to give money to Greece. A woman working part-time in a supermarket in Greece earns EUR 150. This cannot be the case anymore. Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen: the Greek right-wing are now going door-to-door giving families EUR 20, EUR 30 When you earn EUR 150, 20 or 30 is a lot. The extreme right in Greece is doing what the Islamists are doing in other countries. Is European Union therefore not able, in this crisis situation, to provide a social redemption fund to help crisis-hit countries like Greece so that Greek citizens turn back to Europe and not to the extreme right? You can see fascism spreading in Greek society.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said what I want to say. The notion of a compass is very straightforward: more opportunities for the European Union to intervene, a meaningful European budget, a social redemption fund for crisis-hit countries in Europe With this and the proposals made by Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Daul, we can bring back the majority of European citizens towards Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Callanan, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ECR Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span>Mr President, two weeks ago I was privileged to be with Mr Daul and others from this House in Tampa, where Mitt Romney told the Republican National Convention: ‘I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed, but his promises gave way to disappointment and division’.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say to President Barroso: my group supported you for a second term. We wanted you to succeed in shaping a positive agenda for reform of the EU. In some areas, such as international trade or the single market, your Commission has made some progress which we welcome, and we welcome your further announcements today of progress on the single market. But overall I have to say we are very disappointed. Rather than seeing European renewal, as you yet again promised last year, all we have seen is the same old tired approach: more Europe rather than better Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly two years ago the main initiative to emerge from your State of the Union speech was project bonds. Two years on, nothing has happened, they are merely at a pilot phase. Last year your big idea was an EU-wide financial transactions tax, and today thankfully that idea is dead in the water. This year we have a banking union, we have more Treaty change – the knee-jerk reflex of the European elite to every crisis. You told us today that we have the power to shape the world. Mr Barroso, can I suggest that first of all you concentrate on solving the problems of Europe before you worry about shaping the rest of the world?</p>
<p class="contents">And so far, the response to the euro zone crisis has been characterised by seeking short-term, sticking-plaster solutions and long-term institutional navel-gazing. Listening to you today it looks as though that is going to continue. Bail-outs – ECB Ponzi schemes – have enabled you to kick the infamous can even further down the road, and last week’s ECB decision to buy up bonds may be, as some Members have said, a useful stop-gap, but it is in no sense a solution. Risks have simply been transferred from one balance sheet to another.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential nonsense of this current approach was for me brilliantly illustrated over the summer. If you remember, Greece had to repay a EUR 5 billion loan to the ECB, so to do this they issued new short-term bonds. All of these bonds were bought by Greek banks. Those Greek banks are, of course, all technically bust. So where did they get the money from? They borrowed it from the ECB to pay the Greek state who then gave it back to the ECB again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is exactly the kind of financial chicanery which caused the economic crisis in the first place, and now you want us to have another long drawn-out academic debate about more Treaty change, about a banking union. We will scrutinise your proposals very carefully to make sure that they respect the rights of those Member States that thankfully chose not to join the euro. We wish to maintain the integrity of the single market and ensure that your proposals do not damage that market.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro was, of course, a political project from the start. I well remember the many debates in this House we had about it, where the political symbolism was much more important than the economic reality. I bet many of you are regretting that now. Well, President, we are now in an economic crisis and it will be solved with economic solutions, by confronting some fairly stark economic truths.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a reality – and Members have referred to this, Mr Barroso referred to this – that some euro zone countries are less competitive than others. For them, the euro is acting like a straitjacket, preventing the currency devaluation that would give them time to put in place longer-term reforms. And to illustrate how urgent the problem is, I agree with Mr Swoboda, a new report from the ILO shows that Spain now has the highest documented unemployment rate in the world. Greece unfortunately comes second. This is misery on an epic scale in those countries, and we really should do something about it. So let us be honest about it. Let us be honest with ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way that the euro can be made to work with 17 members is if the people of Germany, the people of the Netherlands, the people of Finland, are prepared to transfer cash – not loans, cash – from their taxpayers’ pockets in order to bridge the competitiveness gap. Now I do not think that is ever going to happen and the people of those countries deserve our understanding of why that is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">So surely the only other alternative is for some countries to leave the euro, to devalue their currencies and for us to support them as they find the right policies that will return them to sustainable public spending and growth in the long-term. The euro area needs to be restructured, and I do not say that with delight, Mr Barroso. I say it because I think it is the only realistic course of action that will deliver for people who are desperate for a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU faces a crisis of leadership. Mr Barroso told us so himself last year in the State of the Union address, and I agree with him in that particular case. The EU does face a crisis of leadership. It needs a leadership that faces the economic reality of the euro crisis and does not keep avoiding the problem. We need new leadership that respects our nation states as building blocks of democracy which should be supported and not undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">We take away people’s right to control their destiny through the ballot box at our peril. Already frustrated, angry and fearful people are toying with extremist forces and the alarm bells should be ringing. On that point, and on that point alone, I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new leadership which will tackle Europe’s fundamental competitiveness crisis in the wider global economy and which will pursue a new direction to relaunch growth along the lines outlined by 12 EU prime ministers in their letter in February.</p>
<p class="contents">In America, Governor Romney has set out a plan for how he would renew America by returning it to a land of personal ambition, enterprise and freedom. In the EU we come from the same traditions and we are at our best when government is small, when markets are free and when the people exercise control over their government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I still hope that, as you prepare your work programme for next year, it is not too late for you to shake off the policies of the past and to champion genuine reform of the EU so that it can become relevant to today’s reality and help us to succeed in facing the difficult years ahead.</p>

It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here.</p>
<p class="contents">Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer.</p>

I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you have explained your idea of the route which the European Union will take towards becoming a banking union and a political union and you have highlighted the model of a democratic federation of nation states. There is obviously a lot to say about this. However, I believe that the decisive point, which forms the basis of all the discussions about developing the European Union’s future and working together to shape it, is: What is the people’s opinion of this, how will they become involved and whose interest does a future model of this kind ultimately serve? If we can answer this question, it will probably be easier for us to discuss the sort of Europe that we need in the future. Many others have recently been talking in the same way as you about fundamental changes of course that now need to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to explain to you that, in my view, at least three premises have not been met which are needed to prevent us from ending up in a blind alley. This also applies to what you have said today, at least in the case of the first two. It is clear from your answer that you are afraid, along with other representatives of the European institutions and the governments, of the threat of losing economic and political influence in the world, of the shrinking proportion of the population and the dwindling share of resources, to put it briefly, of sacrificing economic power and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are willing to combat the crisis in the EU, but not its causes. The focus is moving away from the interests of the people, who urgently need a functioning, social and green Union based on the principle of solidarity. We need to hold the discussion now and not to paint a picture which may apply at some point in the future, but is not relevant to their interests and their current difficulties. You are putting the emphasis on greater regulation by the institutions, because this is what the financial elite needs. This is how you intend to bring an end to the functional deficits in the EU economy and, in particular, in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point, and here I will leave you out to a certain extent, is that you, in other words, the institutions and, most importantly, those in government, are assuming that this route will be accompanied by a serious threat to Europe’s democratic fabric. I am very grateful to you for one thing, which is that you have made it clear that the European Parliament is needed, because without Parliament and its elected Members the discussion on reshaping Europe is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have welcomed many of the Commission proposals, including a banking union and Eurobonds, if they had not focused primarily on making profits in a competitive global environment. I want to be quite clear about this. I am in favour of more regulation of the markets and the banks, the removal of functional deficits in the economic and monetary union and even the banking union and Eurobonds. However, I am opposed to these objectives, to the way in which they will be achieved, to the conditions that have been put in place and to undermining democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must focus on the people in the European Union, in particular in the hard-hit crisis countries, and, most importantly, young people, old people, the unemployed and women. An earlier speaker mentioned, for example, the question of the Commission withdrawing its proposal for quotas for women and I would like to know why this is being done. In the light of the fact that most of the proposals for bringing an end to the crisis and developing the future European Union have been made by men, and in this context the presence of Ms Merkel by no means constitutes equality, and that women have been hardest hit by the crisis, I find it incomprehensible that we are prepared to sacrifice a fundamental value and a part of the European Parliament’s and the EU’s concept of themselves and, without making any protests, withdraw a call for women’s equality now and allow it to be taken away from us. I cannot accept that and my group will also not support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called reforms which have been adopted in the memorandum with regard to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the Euro Plus Pact, the fiscal compact and so on, represent an attack on people’s fundamental social rights. Mr Barroso, you cannot explain here how important the people and their social situation in the European Union are to you, while at the same time the Commission, which is part of the troika, is largely responsible for imposing conditions on Greece which will have an impact on the social situation of the very weakest members of society. As a member of the troika, the Commission simply cannot allow calls for working hours to be extended from five to six days, for the minimum wage to be drastically reduced and for strikes to be banned. That is totally unacceptable. It is your job to protect precisely these European Union values in times of crisis. The Commission is the guardian of the European Union’s values and standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In my group’s view, one example of what we are currently experiencing is the fiscal compact. We are still questioning whether it complies with EU law. In the meantime, we have had the treaty evaluated by an expert and it is correct that the compact lies outside the EU’s legal framework. It falls back on EU institutions for its implementation, but excludes the European Parliament. In the near future my group will be evaluating how we can take political action against this and what rights we have in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the path that the European Union is taking, and previous speakers have already discussed this, those in power are increasingly having recourse to the German model. However, the German model is not suitable for use as a model for the future European Union. We cannot accept it in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to ask you specifically to reformulate your ideas, and you have already been called on to do this, about how we can emerge from the crisis and where the European Union should go. You should focus on the social progress clause and the social pact. You should stop all attempts to privatise social goods, social services, social security systems and pensions and put an end to any pressure on the Member States to do so. These are the reasons why many people have lost their faith in the European Union. We need to restore that faith and we can only do this by finally taking on the task of creating a social, green and democratic Europe based on the principle of solidarity, a democratic Union which also fulfils its obligation as a global player to show solidarity with others. I would like to distance myself totally from what has just been said by those on the right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Peter Martin  (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, as a critical but fervent pro-European, I am, of course, just as concerned as almost everyone else here. We know that the decision made in Karlsruhe today will in reality only buy us a little more time. We know that all the measures that have been taken so far, whether these are liquidity injections from the European Central Bank (ECB), aid for Greece or the latest decision to buy bonds, are just a roundabout way of financing the banks. It is no coincidence that bank shares rose dramatically last Thursday. This is, of course, bitterly ironic, because the City of London has benefited from these bank redistributions out of the euro area and involving the euro. There is a group in this Parliament which spends its time defending the City of London – you could also call them the most effective lobbyists – and those are the members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who are constantly saying the same thing, which is very dangerous for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have been speaking about the irresponsible actions of the banks which triggered the crisis. However, we are also aware that we politicians have failed, because we have not kept the banks under control. You asked whether it was realistic for us to expect to regain the confidence of the markets, but that is not really the right question. The question is: Why are you not finally tackling the issue of bank regulation, as your mentor Ms Merkel has already done? Every player, every financial institution and every market place must be controlled. Why do we no longer talk about the fact that possibly the most important financial act of the 20th century, the US Glass-Steagall Act of 1932, could be a suitable model for Europe? If we were to implement it, we would finally be rid of the problem of banks that are too big to fail. It is clear that many banks are not only too big to fail, but also much too big to be managed effectively. We do not even need to mention the word LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). I would like to know why you are not bold enough to take the necessary effective action. The Glass-Steagall Act has only 37 pages. Our previous confused attempts to bring the financial world under control amount to thousands of pages. This results in a lack of understanding and reinforces the crisis of confidence which you rightly referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were already in the process of tackling the banking system, then you would, of course, also need to look at the shadow banks, which worldwide have a volume of almost EUR 46 billion, amounting to a quarter of the entire financial market. The members of the Commission do not even know how much money is being used where and in what way. We do not know how many naked credit default swaps there are on government bonds. That is one of the main reasons why all the measures now being taken are being taken in this way. We can intervene here and we can introduce regulations. This also applies to the rating agencies, which politicians and legislators have elevated to their current position, and to the lobby groups. How can it be that there are 700 financial lobbyists with a budget of EUR 350 million in Brussels and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs almost have to beg to get hold of the information they need? The situation is totally unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the crisis of confidence and that is, of course, entirely appropriate. However, if you do not succeed in getting the monster that is the financial markets under control, you will not have a majority anywhere in Europe for what is presumably a sensible objective, in other words, a strong Europe in a globalised world. You are well aware that you will not be able to avoid holding referendums, at least in Germany and in my home country of Austria, on a new project. However, if there are to be referendums, then the necessary steps must be taken first.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of what has already been said on this subject is, of course, true. However, I would like to repeat that you should be concentrating solely on regulating the financial markets. It is clear from conversations with people all over Europe that this is a very important issue. A new conspiracy theory is now going the rounds which claims that Europe is really governed by Goldman Sachs, because Mr Draghi, Mr Monti and many of the events in Greece have direct links with Goldman Sachs. These are dangerous trends. However, if you manage to get the financial sector under control, then you will no longer have to be concerned about sovereign power. I am convinced that we can win the referendums, but the key word is, of course, not ‘banking union’, but ‘citizens union’ or to put it briefly ‘citizens not banks’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very proud to mention that the Council is not only represented here today by the Presidency but also by some distinguished colleagues, members of the Council on behalf of their countries, and this is in itself a very strong signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the opportunity to hear the reactions from the different political groups within this House. It is a privilege for all of us to be able to debate these issues and discuss the challenges which we face in Europe today. I have heard a range of views from different speakers, but I sense that – whatever their different views – the vast majority in this House are committed to making sure that from the current crisis we build a better and more solid Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset the founders of the European Union aspired to create an ever closer Union, a Europe which is ‘solidly united and constructed around a strong framework’. Schuman’s words remain particularly relevant to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever Europe needs to be united. We need to safeguard the strong institutional framework within which we work. And we must continue to ensure smooth and efficient cooperation between us. The Cyprus Presidency is committed to ensuring this, and committed in particular to working constructively, both within the Council and in osmosis with the European Council and President Van Rompuy, but also – importantly – with both the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately all our decisions have to be about making Europe a better place for its citizens. That means defending values of equality, pluralism, freedom and justice which lie at the heart of our unique Union. That means social cohesion and solidarity. President Barroso mentioned also fairness and equity, indeed fundamental values that must be the basis for all our decisions in order to deliver a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to use the opportunities presented by the current difficulties to realise the true potential of the EU. We must in particular seize the opportunity to take the steps which are essential if we are to build a better Europe. What does that mean in practice? I will mention just a few key examples.</p>
<p class="contents">We must firstly secure an agreement on the MFF, our main investment tool – not any agreement, but an agreement which shows that the Union’s resources are being invested for the benefit of its citizens and in particular for its younger generation. It must focus on innovation and competitiveness, so providing the momentum for increased growth and the creation of jobs. A prompt agreement will send a strong signal that the EU is serious about growth and that it is ready to take decisive steps to invest in its future.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso referred this morning to the report on the development of the EMU. This will be another vital step in strengthening the Union. We must seize the initiative presented by this report and take the opportunity to create a stronger and more mature economic and monetary union, making institutional changes if needed and at the appropriate moment, in order to be better able to withstand the challenges from both within and outside.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also establish the Common European Asylum System which will contribute to the building of a common area of protection, on the basis of solidarity and fair burden-sharing – a safe area for all citizens of the EU and fully in line with universal values.</p>
<p class="contents">Through warranted reforms and decisions as underlined by President Barroso, we should restore credibility and confidence. The wise words of John Kennedy more than fifty years ago are just as relevant to the EU today: ‘in a crisis, be aware of the danger – but recognise the opportunity’.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to our younger generations in particular to create a prosperous Europe, in which they can dream and aspire to fulfil those dreams. Europe has never simply been about economic growth and indicators. We must also create a place where everyone in society is included, where our environment is allowed to flourish without the threat of pollution and climate change, where agriculture is the friend of the land and where human activity, in all its expressions, is allowed to flourish. Our Union is above all a place of respect, dignity and tolerance, of values and ideals. That is something which we should be proud of and protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close by thanking again President Barroso for his inspirational presentation of the State of the Union, and for his leadership and vision. He can count firmly on the support of the Council in this Herculean task lying ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I would like to use this occasion to draw your attention to the proposal for a directive on improving gender balance in corporate boardrooms that has recently been presented by Vice-President Reding to the College. Its objective of increasing women’s representation in corporate governance to 40% by 2020 has been supported by Parliament through different resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that such a proposal would be a clear signal that the European Union still considers gender equality as a priority of its agenda. This would require binding legislation as well as additional supporting measures to accompany the quota system. However, in the past weeks we have heard reports of growing attempts to block such a proposal by some Member States and also the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring gender-balanced representation in the public as well as in the private sector is not only a matter of fairness and democracy but also of economic effectiveness. Therefore I would strongly encourage you to openly reaffirm your support and, through it, the support of the Commission as a whole for such a proposal. We are very eager to discuss it within the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are we setting as our top priority reforms that serve our vision, in other words reforms that promote social justice, growth and the functioning of the single market, such as the reform of tax systems, combating tax evasion and the liberalisation of the markets, or are we setting as our priority reforms that undermine our vision, such as full deregulation of the labour market, the abolition of collective bargaining and the role of the social partners? We must decide what sort of reforms we want to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the President has made some remarks that go in the right direction for constructing European democracy. Regardless of what form this may take, we must create a European democracy today, without changing the treaties, and for that reason I would like to make a very simple proposal: a democratic pact for the EU which does not merely ask the European parties to put forward their candidates, but above all establishes – and the Commission may already put money aside for this – a system of discussions between the 27 EU Member States.

Does that perhaps mean that we have become rich through wastage? That method also exists: richness through wastage, through consumption. However, under the budgetary discipline now being imposed, GDP has fallen, we are becoming poorer and unemployment is rising, exacerbated by technological progress.

Therefore, I am very grateful to you for calling very clearly today for the unification of the states of Europe. Our goal is the creation of the United States of Europe and how we organise it is our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which was very important to me is that when we achieve this objective, we must see the citizens of Europe as our target group and make them into our allies. Only when we are working towards the goal of getting the citizens on our side with regard to the short-, medium- and long-term measures can we make domestic policy genuinely European and obtain the necessary majorities to enable us to reach our destination.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is why it is so important to me that you did not talk about the financial crisis, but about the crisis of confidence and credibility. You also explained that this is a political crisis. Because it is a political crisis, we are in a position to solve it, if we can bring the citizens on board. Let us start talking to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is critically important that Europe wins the psychological battle ‘for’ and ‘against’ further European integration by demonstrating the clear added value the European Union gives to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words: We need a EU multiannual financial framework and budget that are not based on the crisis’ negative psychological impact but ensure the achievement of our goals for 2020, resulting in growth, jobs and, of course, the convergence of living standards and conditions across all regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need another failure like the one that happened in 2010 with the Lisbon Strategy. The cohesion policy must not be reduced – the Member States and their leaders must understand this and get the same message across in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg, when they return to their capitals in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding the banking union and the bank supervision mechanism proposed in that connection. It will monitor banks both in the euro area and outside it, which is why I believe countries outside the euro area should also have their say in this mechanism.

However, instead of answering questions, we must devote our attention to the present in the light of recent dramatic developments, so that we can resolve these problems on behalf of our citizens. For example, huge numbers of well-educated young people in Spain and Greece are unemployed. There are also many unemployed older people. This is where direct aid is required in the form of targeted investment in education, health, the environment and jobs. We also need the European values. You have my full support in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned the banks. People do not understand the processes. The most recent decision made by the European Central Bank (ECB) is like the situation of a person who is fighting for air and who is given oxygen. Very quick decisions are also needed here.

But I must respond to Mr Farage’s rather patronising reference to little Ireland being bullied into voting twice on the Lisbon Treaty. We were not bullied. It was the decision of the Irish Parliament to hold a referendum and of the Irish people to accept it. Secondly, there was a fundamental difference between Lisbon I and Lisbon II. In Lisbon II each Member State got a Commissioner. Different entirely to Lisbon I.</p>

I think we all agree on that, but I would like to add something else. Growth will not work without justice. As long as the large fortunes of wealthy people in the European Union continue getting bigger and bigger and as long as the people who have to do the hard work are paid less and less, there will be no justice and, of course, no growth, because there will be no mass purchasing power. Therefore, we need to make some changes to our systems. We need a fairer tax system, in which large companies start to pay tax again. We need fairer wages, which allow working people to benefit from the immense wealth that they create. Most importantly, we need a fair market economy, which does not involve the shareholders being paid and, at the same time, the workers being made redundant. If those changes are made, we will have a Europe for the people. Otherwise, nothing will happen.</p>

However, unlike you, I am filled with concern and doubt. Your plans are, as always, indeed very nice and promising, but I am afraid that they are unrealistic. You are assuming that you have been managing the crisis correctly for three years. Unfortunately the situation is much, much more subtle than that. We are already far behind schedule. We are trying to struggle through an economic crisis, adopting austerity packages, and drafts and sanctions incompatible with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that the future existence and economic prosperity of the EU will be founded on a banking union. In truth, this banking union excludes ten countries from any meaningful work from the outset. These countries may of course join, but joining will give them no benefit whatsoever. Whereas if they stay outside, they will of course enjoy all the disadvantages. In your speech you spoke of an interconnected world in which there should be no building of walls. I have to ask, President Barroso, what is this if not a wall? What is this if not a wall, if we are not talking about uniform rules, and the EU is not functioning according to uniform rules? In my opinion, this should be changed, and I agree with you that we should be talking about a single EU and uniform rules in the interest of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, Europe clearly needs reforms, which means that enterprise and entrepreneurs should be given a clear opportunity to increase growth and create jobs, because neither we in the European Parliament nor you in the Commission create jobs. Jobs are created by entrepreneurs, who must be granted opportunities by lowering taxes and reducing bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot understand why companies’ reinvested profits could not now be exempted from income tax throughout Europe. And lastly – Europe needs e-government.

<p class="contents">Let me first underline that I saw, of course, different positions in this debate – some criticisms, some comments – but I think I can see, at least from the most relevant pro-European forces, strong support for the agenda I have put forward: an agenda which combines ambition with realism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ambition is very important but so is the way we deliver on that ambition. Ambitions without results are simply good intentions, and sometimes I have the impression that in Europe we are full of good intentions but with not enough results. This is why we need to have this vision, the vision of a medium-term, longer-term, European Union that is a federal path – and I hope that we will not engage now in semantic discussions about how exactly to qualify it. It is a federal path and it is ambitious, but at the same time we need to respond to issues which are extremely serious and urgent now, even before we get the – in some cases necessary – revision of the current treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is our way and this is the way the Commission will pursue with determination. This is the only realistic way to achieve progress in Europe, and those people who pretend that the status quo is enough or those people who pretend that everything will change tomorrow are not in fact serious about what has to be done for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot resist recalling something that a predecessor of mine, Jacques Delors, once said in French – it was good advice : </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> ‘Beware of the over-excited!’ </p>
<p class="contents">‘Beware of the over-excited’. We need to have ambition but at the same time every step must be taken with our feet firmly on the ground – and not forgetting one thing: that we are accountable to the European citizens of Europe and we have to have them with us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why one of the most important messages that I believe I brought you today was: How can we complete European democracy? What can we do? Not against our countries, because our countries are still the most important political reference for most of our citizens, but what can we do with our countries to show that they will only count in the world if they accept a much stronger Union; that on their own they will not have the leverage or the capacity to talk on an equal footing with the Americans or the Chinese or other powers; but that yes, together in Europe, we can do this and we can make a difference. That, precisely, is the message I brought you today.</p>
<p class="contents">A message where we work with our countries, not for the sake of nationalism, but in fact to win the battle against the nationalists or the extreme populists, to have a democratic federation of countries, a federation of citizens naturally, a union for the citizens of Europe. This is the message I brought you today and this is the only way to go forward if we want to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">If you read my speech last year, at that time some of the ideas were not given much consideration, but one year later we have seen that the governments – and I believe most political forces – have finally agreed. I proposed the redirection of central funds. I proposed the refinancing of the EIB, I proposed the creation of project funds – there was no consensus for all these ideas at that time, now they are agreed on.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also the Commission that proposed some time ago the creation of a strong backstop. At that time we proposed EUR 440 billion. It was rejected by some. It was not considered realistic; now we have it and today – it was about time – we have had the decision of the Constitutional Court of Germany. This shows that what is not agreed to today will become a consensus tomorrow, and our duty here as European institutions is precisely to build on this consensus, to show ambition but at the same time to do so with realism. This is the way to achieve those steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked some specific questions, particularly on the banking union, which I think are very important. One was about doing this or not with the Central Bank. Fourteen out of the 17 national supervisors in the euro area today are already the central banks, and the UK is now in fact moving to place these tasks with the Bank of England, so there is not one single model in the European Union and the euro area. What matters is the quality and credibility of the supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us be frank. Do we want to delay or do we want a solution? We have agreed, and it was a Commission proposal, to do this around the European Central Bank because this is a well-established European institution, a federal institution in the euro area. Of course we will do this ensuring a separation between the monetary functions and the future supervisory function. Our model offers all the guarantees that one could ask for – the independence of monetary policy – but what we need is a credible supervisor that can break free from the national capture of national supervisors and do so quickly. That is why the ECB is by far the best placed for this. Once again, if we now start to change this, there will be delay. Delaying the solutions is probably in the interests of some people, but it is certainly not in the interest of the European Commission. We want to have a single supervisor for the euro area as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have put forward a proposal that, in fact, also addresses other matters like the relationship between euro and non-euro area members. The single supervisory mechanism will strengthen the single market. The proposal is designed so as not to create any walls in the single market. The ECB will apply the single rule book, the substantive rules on bank capital requirements and so on which are agreed by all 27 Member States. More effective and consistent application is good for the stability and safety of all.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-euro area Member States should be able to take part. The proposal is as open as possible. Those outside the euro area can take part through a close cooperation arrangement. We have gone as far as possible within, of course, the current Treaty legal limits and there are lots of other safeguards. The decisions on supervision of cross-border banks will continue to be made in colleges of supervisors in which host Member States will still have their full say even where the ECB is the home supervisor, and the European Banking Authority will keep all its powers to solve disputes and uphold single market rules including vis-à-vis the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all to show you that no-one is more committed than the Commission to the idea of a Union, to the integrity of the European Union, and yes, to the principle of non-discrimination between Member States, Article 4. When Prime Minister I was one of those fighting for the principle of equality between all our Member States to be recognised. Of course there are different economic dimensions, different demographic dimensions, but as regards the law all the Member States have exactly the same dignity and we should strive for a unity based on these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the points made concerned growth and social matters. First of all, growth. We have to be very honest about this. The biggest problem we have with growth in Europe is the lack of competitiveness that has been accumulated in some of our Member States and we need to bring in reforms for that competitiveness. There are difficult, more urgent, problems, such as the lack of financing for the economy. Some of our countries in fact are making impressive – impressive – efforts of adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">What Greece has achieved is sometimes not sufficiently recognised – or Ireland or Portugal. An impressive adjustment, but what is their problem? They also have a problem in financing the economy precisely because the sovereign debt problems contaminated the banks’ problems. So we should not forget what lay at the origin of this crisis and the origin of this crisis, I have to say to the Eurosceptics: No, it was not the euro. Britain has put in more taxpayers’ money to save the banks than any country in Europe. Iceland is not a member of the euro or the European Union, so it was not the euro which created the problem; it was the irresponsible behaviour of the financial sectors in many areas of the world, including the United States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This was the crux of the problem, and let me tell you that sadly we can see that some people in the financial sector have learnt nothing. After what happened we continued to receive reports of rigging with Libor, manipulating the interest rates. We have seen banks in the United States that are financing Iran contrary to all the legislation of the United States. We have seen banks from Britain financing drug smuggling in Mexico. We continue to see some intolerable practices in the financial sector. This was part of the problem and that is why we need to regulate and to have credible supervision in the financial sector as well.</p>
<p class="contents">But this was not the whole cause of the problem. There was also unsustainable debt created by our governments; this is the reality. I am sorry, some people prefer to hear just some part of the reality, but we have to look at the reality in full. That is why we need to see how we came here. We came to this situation because the financial markets did not behave properly and that was the responsibility not of the European Union but of the national supervisors. The European Union at that time had no responsibility at all in terms of national supervision. We are now creating, we are now establishing, the first elements of this European supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of the debt were also created because some Member States did not respect the Stability and Growth Pact which they themselves had signed. When there is no respect for the rules, naturally there are problems of credibility. So I think it is fair to say that Europe’s current problems were not created by the European Union for the Member States, they were much more created by the Member States for the European Union and this is the reality of what we have today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But now of course we have to see how to get out of this situation, and to get out of this situation requires proper financial supervision and regulation. Addressing the problems of deficit is also required, and so Member States which are under this pressure should continue with consultation measures and also with stricter reforms because there is an underlying problem of lack of comparison in some of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy; there will not be a magic solution; it will require time, determination, persistence, coherence. I know that populists manipulate feelings and anger; they can offer a very simple solution. The solution is ‘No’. Saying ‘No’ is easy; saying ‘No’ to Europe is easy. What is difficult, and that requires leadership, is to say ‘Yes’ but while saying ‘How can we move forward?’ And that is why I am asking you to bring about the conditions for a true European debate with a true European democracy. And I am giving the signal for the next European elections because I believe in democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I was elected to my Parliament in Portugal when I was just twenty-nine years old. Mr Farage, do not look at me like that because in fact I really have a great admiration for the wisdom of the British people. Every time you have tried to be elected in Britain you were rejected; that is why you came here. It shows that the British people know that it is much better to keep you away from your own system.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Every time I ran for election in my country I was elected. I was leader of the opposition, I was Prime Minister and to be President of the Commission I received the support of this European Parliament. But I think we have to go forward. I think we need to go for the next elections with all the relevant political parties – not you, frankly – but with all the relevant political parties to present a candidate for the Commission President and to have a truly political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we adopted formally a new regulation for European political parties and I am calling not only on citizens, not only on you, but also on the best forces in Europe to engage in this debate on what we can do. Then I want to appeal to my pro-European, including federalist, friends. Frankly, sometimes I believe we waste too much time and energy criticising secondary issues. I think we have to unite the pro-European forces with regard to the future of Europe. A future that, yes, is to keep the social market economy. The social market economy is in the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not an invention. But at the same time to prepare the European consensus to reform those economies that will become more competitive. That is why European democracy is important.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some people who say democracy cannot be transnational and can only be national because it is based on national parliaments. I am sorry, but those who say that have not understood that we are already in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century. In the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century we have transnational phenomena like the financial markets, and if we do not have transnational mechanisms to deal with them, the peoples, the citizens, will not have the leverage to regulate them and to have their say. That is why we also need at European level a European democracy, and a European democracy that is not built against our national democracies but to complement them, to coordinate, and that basis for European democracy is precisely this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I am telling you. I am telling you that the Commission is ready to engage in this Parliament and that we are going to put proposals forward before the next European elections so that we can have a real European debate, one where the political forces that are for Europe can say why they are for Europe and those who are against should also say why they are against Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What annoys me today, to be very honest with you, and which we have to recognise, is that in many of our countries those who are taking the lead in the European debate are the anti-Europeans, the Eurosceptics, the populists, the extreme nationalists. That is why we have to provoke the pro-European forces, if necessary by making a positive, constructive clean break with them, to ask them to come and say what the consequences of not having this Europe will be. Because many of the young people around Europe do not remember when a great part of Europe was under totalitarian Communism or when there was no democracy in the south of Europe. They do not remember the times of non-freedom of movement – so we need to make the case for Europe, and to do that we need the pro-European forces from the Left, the Right and the Centre to come and fight for that ideal: to explain it, to take the initiative and not be always on the defensive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is what we can do for the next European elections and that is why the European Commission will come with proposals which will enable us to leave our comfort zone and sometimes see some of the governments of Europe giving up to those extremist forces because they believe that in that way they will keep some of the votes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very important point I want to make to you because some of us, instead of trying to attack each other, would be making a much better use of our time if we could try to convince not only the parties here in Strasbourg, but also the parties back home in the capitals, to say the same thing they say here in Strasbourg. The reality is that very often we hear the parties saying one thing here and we know very well that when the same parties are in the governments back home, they say a very different, if not a completely contradictory, thing. This is why we need to build a true public space in Europe with a true European democracy, with true European parties and true European institutions, not working against our Member States but working for a Union that goes beyond the Member States and that gives each Member State and our citizens the capacity to defend our interests and our values in the global world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that I believe that the judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court is a good one. For the second time in just a few days, the almost hysterical opponents of Europe have been defeated, firstly by the decision of the European Central Bank and now by the decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court. This shows that given courage and clear decision-making, it is possible to strengthen Europe, even though certain limits have been set.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to strongly support what was said by Ms Gurmai and other speakers on the question of women. I spoke yesterday with Ms Reding. It is important, particularly in the world of business and also with regard to appointments made by European institutions, that the many excellent women candidates receive support. Just like the men, they must have the opportunity to take up certain positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to thank the Commission for its draft document on political parties. It is very good that we now have a new draft which will allow us to move forwards. I support the principles relating to the political parties. I visit all the Member States and I have said there exactly what you, Mr Barroso, have said here.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, just so that everything is not quite so harmonious, Mr Barroso, you have declared your support for the European social model. This is a good thing and I am in favour of it. However, given the situation in Greece, I have made it quite clear, including when I visited Greece, that stringent and often painful structural forms are needed. Not everyone in Greece wanted to hear that, even my friends there, but that is what is needed. If the troika, including the Commission, now calls for the reintroduction of the six-day week and the 13-hour day and removes other social rights, we will be seeing the destruction of the social state. Mr Barroso, we cannot support the social state and the social model in Parliament while at the same time allowing the Commission officials in the troikas to dismantle and destroy the social state. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot accept that. It is not a basis for consensus. I would very much like to come to a consensus with you and the Commission about the social model and the social state, but then the Commission officials in the troikas must ensure that the social state is not dismantled and that at least its core structures remain in place. That is the principle that we in the S&amp;D Group stand for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would see that as a positive development in this Plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come back to the main discussion we had an hour ago. I think – and my group thinks – that the Commission should make more use of its right of initiative on a number of topics and on a number of issues. I would advise the Commission not to wait for the green light – or red light – from Paris, Berlin or other capitals. The red light is always there but not the green light. It needs to do what is necessary and put its legislative proposals on the table. The effect on the market would be so positive that it would be far more difficult for these countries to react negatively.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns banking union. Mr Barroso has said that he does not want a delay. I do not want a delay either. But that does not mean that, if he does not agree with a proposal that has the support of the Council – and mainly of Germany in this instance – that we cannot discuss it. Just because Germany considers that the ECB should do a given job we do not have to agree with it. I am sorry, but that is not codecision, is it? Codecision means that for a short period – and you can be sure that our coordinators will respect that and will examine the proposal – you can suggest other, better possibilities, rather than creating double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Germany they need to be serious. They cannot at the same time give tasks other than monetary functions to the ECB and criticise Mr Draghi for the interventions he is currently making in the markets. It is one or the other: either it is independent – in which case we have no financial supervision – or it is not, in which case they can continue to criticise Mr Draghi, as they have been doing in recent weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the subject of the model of the European social state, I would like to make it clear that there is no social state in Greece. It does not currently exist. If we want to have a model of a social state, then the European Union must set up a social fund to relaunch the social state in Greece. That is simply how it is. We cannot always continue making progress. If someone living in Greece today does not have a job, then he has absolutely no means of support. Does that make sense? The model of the European social state can only be developed further if we help it to be reborn in the countries where it no longer exists. People must finally understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Ms Reding, we support your initiative, as I hope the Commission and all the men there do, to bring about a gender balance in companies. If you would write a letter to Mr Juncker and to the board of the European Central Bank explaining the initiative, that would be a really good message to send out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that this is not a dispute about the future prospects for Europe. In the case of decisions on the European Stability Mechanism and the problems that it would bring, I sometimes hope that Europe will not look to Karlsruhe but to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is where the decision should be made. Also, someone has said, Mr Daul I think, that we should have more courage in appealing to the court. I strongly disagree. Politics is a matter for parliaments. If we take cases before the court more often, it will become a matter for technocrats. That, of course, is not a good thing. The judicialisation of politics will also be the swan song of politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said ‘let us be frank’ five or six times during your speech. That was the winning line.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, let us be frank with you. You really offered us nothing new today, did you? You offered us the same old tired solutions, that the answer to all of our problems is more Europe. Not better Europe, not more efficient Europe, just more Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">And I say that I welcome the debate. Table your proposals. Let us have the debate about whether we want more Europe or whether we want less Europe, whether we want more power to the centre or more back to Member States. And I will tell you something even more radical.

<p class="contents">And then let us do something even more radical and let us take notice this time of what they say if, in fact, they reject your solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you another quote from a dear Member of the EPP Group, from Mr Daul’s party, from José María Aznar, who said over the weekend that the drive for full fiscal and political union is ‘deeply misguided’. He said that ‘a United States of Europe is an impossible idea. It is a very serious mistake to try to destroy nation states. You cannot go against the cultural beliefs of the people and the forces of history’, and I think he was right in what he said there.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in this Chamber, many of the leaders that have spoken, are stuck in the 1950s, in the old mantra of what should be done – all except Mr Cohn-Bendit, of course. He is still stuck on the barricades in 1968. But they offer the tired solutions of the past. We need to reform the EU, we need to look forward to what the EU should offer us in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, and that should be less Europe and more competitive Europe and more competitive economies.</p>

The people of Ireland, of course, have been asked numerous times whether they want more Europe and more times than they have said ‘more’, they have said they wanted less Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have this debate and when we have the results of it, we can do no more. If we really do believe in democracy, let us put the results of any constitutional convention, of proposals for more Europe, to the people of Europe in referenda and see if they agree. If they say yes, I will happily accept that result. But the reason that you will not put it to a referendum is that you know what the result will be and I know what the result will be.

My group expects the Commission to fulfil its responsibilities in the relevant bodies such as the troika, in order to make it entirely clear that the Commission as a European institution wants to ensure that people are no longer pushed into poverty, that working hours are not increased and that environmental and social standards are not ignored. That is your job. If we succeed in making that clear, then we will be sending out a signal to the people who in recent days have gone out onto the streets in their thousands and hundreds of thousands to protest. Our group is in solidarity with these people, whether they are in Thessaloniki or Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard this morning on the news that cancer patients are protesting in Greece. How bad has the situation become when people who are in the midst of a serious social and personal crisis are not receiving any more help and support, because the health system has collapsed? We finally need to take action in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in positions of responsibility believe that people in Greece and in other states have been living beyond their means. They must now be punished for this and have sanctions imposed on them. This is not an appropriate way of strengthening the European community, which is based on solidarity. I am not implying that you are one of these people, Mr Barroso, but this is a theme which is being constantly repeated in the media in many countries and, unfortunately, also in mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, to Mr Martin – because he was accusing me of giving too much attention to other Members of the Parliament – we are currently discussing in the Commission what we can do in terms of this issue of the risks inherent in different kinds of activities between banks.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Commissioner Barnier has asked Mr Liikanen to put forward a report. Based on that report we will take decisions about what we can do to prevent risks associated with big banks, namely the possibility of addressing the issue of different activities they may pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding other concrete issues, such as Romania and Bulgaria, we have already said that we believe that Romania and Bulgaria meet the necessary conditions to become members of the Schengen area. I want to reiterate that here today. That, of course, does not mean that we do not have the right to act when we believe decisions taken by any of our Member States may call into question some of the principles of the rule of law that all Member States accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you insisted on the issue of social cohesion. Indeed it is a very important matter. The reality is that we are doing what we can at European level, but there are differences here between the instruments available at national and European level. As you may be aware, one of the concerns we now have in terms of the discussion for the next MFF is the opposition that some of our governments are signalling, not only about the reinforcement of the Social Fund, but also the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is so important for workers who may feel the impact and be considered redundant because of some structural transformations in Europe, and even the Solidarity Fund, because there are some governments that are simply proposing the elimination of this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank those of you who have referred to the European programme of aid for deprived persons. I would like to confirm that the Commission will put forward a proposal for a new programme to help poor people in Europe because there is now rising poverty in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is why we have to be absolutely sincere and frank. Yes, I say those words once again. You cannot withdraw from the European institutions the instruments for showing solidarity and afterwards criticise Europe because Europe does not have enough solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to act at European level in the social area. This is critically important, not only because it is just, but because we need a social dimension at European level so that we can keep support for our social market economy and for our European project. When we speak about more Europe, it is not just more Europe for the sake of Europe or for the European institutions. The crisis in the euro area has shown that the credibility of the euro as a single currency is also dependent on the coherence and integration of the decisions taken for the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">When people ask me why we need more Europe, we need more Europe if we want to keep and sustain a common currency. We need more integration of the institutions, but also more harmonisation of norms to avoid behaviours that are against the common norms and also we need more coherence of policies. This is indispensable for a common currency. Of course, we want to make those proposals not just for the euro area but for the European Union because we want this to be united and open for all. If some Members do not want to join us, of course they have that right, but they should not have the right to prevent those who want to have a stronger Union from building that stronger Union, not only for the currency but also for our common goals of a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me thank you for this debate. I believe in democracy. I believe in national democracy, but also in European democracy. I want to reiterate that today, in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, with national democracy alone our citizens will not be able to control their future and their countries will become irrelevant. We are living in fundamentally new times. That is why we need to complete our national democracies with a strong European democracy. This Parliament is the basis for that future stronger European democracy.</p>

The establishment of a European banking union was mentioned today, which in future will allow this sector to be monitored more effectively. I welcome this decision but it is regrettable that there has hitherto been a lack of resolve to take action, which, if it had been taken in time, would have enabled the Union and its Member states to combat the crisis more successfully. I am talking about the establishment of a European credit rating agency, which would have enabled us to evaluate the Member States’ economies more fairly and objectively. I would also like to remind you about the call for a gas purchasing group to be established at EU level which would ensure fair and competitive gas prices for all Member States which in turn would increase the competitiveness of our industry and reduce consumers’ bills. For a long time we have been convinced that the crisis is coming to an end and that in order to exit it as soon as possible we need to take the toughest austerity measures. Now we can see that such austerity measures have reduced consumption and budget revenue collection, have significantly increased unemployment and have halted economic growth in the Member States in the long term. The majority of economists recognise that tough austerity measures have not provided the anticipated benefits but simply further hampered the EU’s economic and social recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreed measures for boosting the economy and reducing unemployment must be implemented as soon and as efficiently as possible. In this regard, I think we must continue to focus on encouraging entrepreneurs and creating jobs in the EU. Topics such as fiscal and budgetary discipline and economic growth should continue to be on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the view that the EU must be strengthened; however, the decisions adopted so far require time in order for them to have visible effects. At the same time, reforms should be based on the principle of equality and on a better coordination. We have been witnessing lately an ever-growing need to deepen integration. President Barroso reiterated a very important topic, that of the federalisation of the European Union. Romania has been a constant supporter of this idea, including the importance of progressing towards a political union. The specific needs of each Member State must be taken into account in order to narrow the gaps in competitiveness and productivity. Only this way will we be able to achieve a coherent economic policy and an internationally relevant external policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its existence should restore confidence in banks and in the single currency of the euro. It would also be part of the long-term plan for the economic and fiscal integration of the EU. The main elements of banking union include banking rules that are applicable throughout the EU – including the common but flexible requirements for the level of capital that banks must maintain, and unified EU banking supervision with direct monitoring of banks operating in many countries and of large banking houses, which would allow enforcement of the rules and greater oversight concerning the control of risks. It also includes common rules to prevent bank failures and allow greater intervention when a bank gets into difficulties – so that it will not be necessary to rescue the bank with taxpayers' money - and a unified system of deposit insurance providing protection to savers, regardless of which EU state they put their money in or invest in.

In this way, by forcing savings, although we can of course improve the general state of public finances temporarily, we are also restricting opportunities for growth, thus threatening the continent with a deepening crisis and large-scale recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States are also pushing for an ideology of reduced public spending at the level of the EU budget in the period up to 2020. It is difficult to understand such a policy in the current economic situation since we know that EU funds play a major part in stimulating the economy, and not only on the demand side, but also through the mechanisms for their acquisition, such as co-financing and the need for job creation, that is to say by an emphasis on new ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, instead of a genuine strategy for growth and jobs, we still only have proposals for deepening integration and depriving Member States of further areas of sovereignty. I therefore look unfavourably upon the idea of creating a single supervisory mechanism over banks or a banking union. In this context, the idea of a new European treaty, under which the EU institutions would take full control of national budgets, finally depriving Member States of the tools to manage their own economies, is annoying and quite unrealistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the face of the deepening of the crisis within the EU and the euro area, and the widespread discrediting of the EU and its institutions, Mr Barroso has proposed a new federalist, neoliberal and militarist plunge into the process of economic and political integration. The announced measures do not solve any of the problems that the workers and people of Europe are facing. The deep crisis in which the EU is mired is the result of the policies and directions that have been pursued for years. These policies have promoted divergence and growing inequality among Member States, as well as the transfer of wealth from the workers to big economic and financial business. There will be no end to the crisis as long as these policies continue. Instead of thinking again and opting for a change in direction and policies, Mr Barroso is now proposing amendments to the institutional architecture of the EU. These amendments are aimed primarily at creating new and more favourable conditions for pursuing those same policies that have brought about disaster and social regression, and which have been brutally imposed on workers and people, with well-known consequences. New institutional shifts are being announced, giving new and greater expression to the growing confrontation between the EU and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the possibilities afforded by the current treaties should be used before starting to draft new ones. The second wave of crisis stems from a lack of credibility on the part of the Union and its Member States, and a few months of disputes over institutional solutions will not help to restore that credibility. We need to act now, and make decisions now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the fifth year of the crisis, and we can safely say that the remedial action taken in Europe has not worked. The measures taken by Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy are not working, and in addition the associated social costs are enormous. The announcement made last week by the President of the ECB regarding indirect support of these countries might have been reason for optimism. However, unless the credibility of the Union and its Member States is recovered, the crisis will not be overcome. I would like to ask President Barroso two questions. Firstly, what measures is the Commission planning in support of the European Central Bank’s actions? Secondly, how does he view Berlin’s proposals, in particular the proposal regarding a departure from the increased 95% share of EU funds in realised projects? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further EU integration is possible and desirable, provided, however, that we are able to assure citizens that the foundations underpinning the integration process will be protected. I refer to peace and security, the protection of important values and increased prosperity. It is worth remembering that the most important and inalienable EU values stem from Christianity. The EU stands for dignity, freedom and solidarity. The proposal to develop the EU as a federation of nation states has been criticised amongst others by radical federalists. ‘Real’ federalists do not want a federation of nation states. What they want, as they have indeed explicitly stated, a post-national EU. In this context, President Barroso’s proposal is moderate, and, for many MEPs, even conservative.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are a number of reasons why a post-national federation is impossible at present. Many European nations simply do not want and cannot imagine a post-national Europe. Additionally, the economic situation of the EU Member States means it is impossible to introduce the harmonisation that would be required in many areas across the federation, such as the minimum wage, minimum pension, minimum income entitlement to social support, the retirement age or the medical services basket. Regardless of the ideology preferred, the harmonisation of standards required to form a federation seems unachievable in the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly important to carry out the plan of establishing a European banking union and the single supervisory mechanism. The fact that banks operate transnationally but are guided by national laws has caused serious economic difficulties for us. I hope the implementation of this plan will not get stuck in the Council once again in verbose Member State discussions, and that the necessary decisions will be taken in the nearest future, allowing for swift establishment of an efficient banking supervisory mechanism. The activity in the financial markets over the past 24 hours shows that the euro has regained trust, and that gives us the time necessary to restore economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European Union institutions and the governments of the Member States must understand that decisive action is required. At the same time, I am doubtful whether all of the political forces elected into this august house understand the seriousness of the situation.

<p class="contents">Sustainable growth cannot be achieved without reforming the labour market and improving productivity in the Member States. These issues must be discussed and resolutely addressed; ignoring the problems only makes the situation worse. The reforms implemented by the Latvian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis set a great example for the other European countries. Mr Dombrovskis took the helm of the government at the deepest point of the crisis, implemented reforms, and today Latvia is experiencing the fastest economic growth in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the results, you will need to come up with much more convincing arguments and projects to try and establish any democratic legitimacy. Your only message, despite being put to the test, boils down to the ultra-liberal and globalist approach of ‘still more Europe', while continuing to subject us to an increasingly speculative and reckless international financial caste. Furthermore we have destroyed the social progress that our people fought so hard for over the centuries, the euro and federalism form a sacrificial religion that stifles farmers, artisans, small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, who are the movers and shakers in our society, in other words, the real and living economic force. Instead, together we should be introducing a mechanism, as soon as possible, enabling an effective exit from the euro rather than suffering the catastrophic consequences of its impending collapse. For this reason, I call for the introduction of referenda in France and in Europe on these crucial issues. Lastly, I call for early European elections to be held given the rapid decline of our respective countries, which are being dragged down precisely because of the ‘state of the European Union’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future of the European Union is above all the future of her children and young people. How can we expect young people to want to build a community which does not respond to their basic needs? More than one third of persons aged between 15 and 24 are not in education or employment. One quarter of the population under 25 are unemployed, and in Greece and Spain almost half of this age group are unemployed. Over 25% of unemployed young persons have been unable to find a job for a year or more. National labour markets mainly offer them poorly paid temporary work which does not match their education or skills. They could look for work abroad, but are often afraid to take advantage of this opportunity. Their fear could be alleviated if they travelled abroad during their studies, but for most of them this means using their own financial resources. It is mainly only the residents of large urban centres who are in a position to do so. How, then, can all young people believe in our common European project? How can they trust us when we call for further sacrifices while talking about equality and democracy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking into account the fact that the Latvian Parliament and ruling coalition contain the pro-Nazi political forces of Latvia, there is nothing new in the statement of Parliament’s Speaker. But for the first time in the history of modern Latvia it is precisely the Speaker of the Saeima who so cynically neglects the opinion of European Union. Last year already, when Knut Vollebæk, the OSCE High Commissioner, mistakenly praised the Latvian Government for ‘successes’ in the integration, the Speaker of the Parliament, Mrs Aboltina, and the Prime Minister of Latvia, Mr Dombrovskis, admired him. Today, when Vollebæk ‘has had his eyes opened’ on the situation in Latvia, his recommendations are not needed. All that gives the right to assert that the Latvian Republic lives by double standards, supporting legislation where features of nationalism and racism are openly displayed! It is necessary to evaluate the statements and actions of members of the ruling coalitions and the Prime Minister of the Latvian Republic, which are leading to national conflict. The ‘Cold War’ against Russian-speaking children started in Latvia. This War can lead to bad results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the ECB buys government bonds from ailing states, it is bending if not breaking the law. Countries which for years have lived above their means are to be rewarded and those which have applied budgetary discipline are to be punished. Furthermore, Slovenia is a demonstration of what happens after the praise for an alleged star pupil has died down. A few years ago, Ljubljana was a model candidate and the threat of insolvency was ignored. However, instead of facing up to reality, they are obviously cheating and making the situation seem better than it is. The question also arises as to who should pay for the whole euro disaster. We cannot continue asking the economically successful euro countries, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, to come up with the cash. This simply will not work. They have already reached the limits of their ability to pay and if Spain requires more money than is currently expected and if Italy also turns out to need the euro rescue package, they will be the last dominos to fall. Therefore, we need to put in place rules as quickly as possible for excluding bankrupt states from the euro zone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now at a point where we can no longer blunder around in the fog. Our actions to date have not led to the desired results. Economists are sounding the alarm as the risk that the crisis will expand and intensify is increasing. Fortunately, Europeans have not lost faith in the EU project. The Eurobarometer results of last week show that 40% of respondents have a positive opinion of the EU. Most respondents thought the European Parliament was a recognisable and trustworthy institution of the EU. As in previous polls, citizens expect the European Parliament to fight poverty, social exclusion and unemployment effectively. This is why Parliament must be fully involved in the implementation and monitoring of the Compact for Growth and Jobs. In particular, we must deal with the issue of increasing employment as soon as possible. I therefore urge the Council to carry out an efficient analysis of the Commission’s employment package, so that new jobs can be created. I welcome the adoption at the last Council meeting of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. This should provide guidance to the Special Representative for Human Rights, and will allow the EU to speak with one voice in the field of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the project of building a common Europe, the nations of Europe set out on an unprecedented endeavour after World War II; yet unfortunately we can all see that trust is to this day incomplete, and not just between Member States and the EU but between states and their citizens as well. Some countries are spending considerable amounts of resources on reaching goals that are long obsolete. There are, for example, Member States that do not view the national minorities living in their territories as an asset, but instead impede their legitimate efforts and continue to seek their assimilation. They spend more on their outdated centralised administration, secret service and armed forces than on education, infrastructure or social affairs. I believe that especially under the present conditions, these practices are not helping us to overcome the dual moral and confidence crisis that is leaving its mark on our everyday lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I completely agree with the creation of a ‘federation of nation states’, as announced today by the President of the Commission himself, along with the strengthening of economic and monetary union and a single supervisory mechanism aimed at ensuring greater banking stability in the euro area. I also believe that it is vital that the austerity measures adopted by the Member States be reconciled with new measures to promote growth and employment. Concrete actions aimed at stimulating economic recovery and job creation should be set out, along with a new industrial policy, the strengthening of research and innovation, and incentives for entrepreneurship. At a time of great economic and social difficulty, I believe that the EU should take particular care of the most vulnerable, strengthening the prevailing sense of solidarity among its peoples. Finally, I would draw the attention of the Commission and the respective Member States to the fact that it is crucial to strengthen the EU budget for 2014-2020, adapting it to the development needs of the various economies and regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although he used the term ̔̔federation of nation states’, what he has in mind is to further strengthen the EU institutions and deprive nation states of their powers. The theory of optimum currency areas explains very well when a single currency creates economic benefit. However, the introduction of the euro was not based on rational assumptions, but rather on political hopes – the hope that a single currency would pave the way for a single European state. We can see now that the euro project does not work and – like a condemned man – it is waiting for the execution of its sentence. As long as there are distinctive nations, cultures, languages and societies in Europe, it cannot succeed. The euro crisis is therefore not only an economic crisis. It symbolises the crisis of the entire concept of a federal Europe. So, is further integration the right way forward? No. We should take a step back. If we are already thinking about a new treaty, then we should go back to the Treaty of Nice. We should restrict the powers of the EU and delegate responsibility to national governments. We need cooperation between states in Europe, and not one state managed from Brussels. Further federalisation of Europe will strengthen the strong centres and marginalise the weak, creating a two-speed Europe, a continent of losers and winners. If we consider the shape of the crisis, we can easily identify the losers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title5"></a><a name="creitem5"></a>

The directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime is proof of the fact that opinions of this kind do not always reflect reality. On the contrary, it shows how much problem-solving ability we have. Firstly, this group of people is being given the same access to the law and the same level of support throughout the entire European Union. This represents a major step forward for Europe and, most importantly, for those affected. It provides important support for the victims of crime. These are generally people who have got into a difficult situation through no fault of their own. By providing professional help which does not stop at national boundaries we are sending out an important signal to these people that they are not being abandoned by society.

The definition of a victim will also be broadened to encompass the family of a person who is murdered or who dies in a terrorist attack.</p>

Therefore, it is extremely important for us to come to an agreement on catch quotas and on protecting fish stocks all over the world.</p>

However, the CFSP must always remain subject to unanimity in the Council as my group, the ECR, does not want to see the EU undermining national sovereignty in this key area or totally usurping the role of national foreign ministries. That explains why my group abstained and could not support all aspects of the Brok report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have as a group engaged constructively with the External Action Service, though not uncritically, particularly over their unreasonable demand for a budget increase in this climate of austerity. I have to say that in spite of the huge crisis in the Union over the euro, the EEAS is actually up and running and that has to be recognised. The EEAS must, however, in this climate of austerity prove its value added, both in savings to the Member States, particularly the smaller ones with lower bilateral representations, and show that States such as my own, the United Kingdom, which are major international players, can see their national interests both protected and better projected through using the new EEAS service. One good example of this is the new European Compound in Juba, South Sudan, where all EU Member States are signing up to using this as a joined-up operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR was also pleased to note a positive reference to Taiwan in the report and in particular Taiwan’s commitment to peace and security in the East Asia region. This commitment has been further reinforced by President Ma’s East China Sea Peace Initiative, a courageous and commendable effort to resolve the long-standing territorial dispute between Taiwan, China and Japan over the Diaoyu Islands/Senkaku Islands. Recently tensions have suddenly escalated with China, I think it was yesterday, sending patrol boats in response to the purchase of the islands by the Japanese Government. President Ma’s imaginative and visionary plan, analogous to what happens over the Antarctic Treaty, deserves in the view of my Group, the EU’s full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I share the minority view expressed by Mr Meyer and Ms Lösing in the related report. This is actually all about militarising the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The goal is to find an intervention strategy and the separation from NATO, which for me as an Austrian is not acceptable, is no longer really recognisable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also believe that the strategy on Turkey is the wrong one, including the call to open further chapters in the membership negotiations. The fact that the policy on Libya has failed has been made clear today following the dreadful attack in Benghazi. The policy on Libya has failed completely, but the report describes a very different situation. Finally, the policy on Syria is also wrong. It focuses on intervention and on putting pressure on Russia and China, which are supposed to be our partners. All of this is because certain interests in Syria need to be taken into consideration. There has been a complete failure to recognise that the rebels are speaking Saudi Arabian dialects. Not a single word has been said about Saudi Arabia. The report is one-sided and, therefore, I have voted against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to highlight two aspects that cause me particular concern. The first is the arms trade. We set ourselves the aim of non-proliferation and disarmament, but at the same time our legislation to control arms exports is totally inadequate. What we say we want to do, therefore, is then denied and contradicted by our behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area in which our limitations are all too evident is conflict prevention, which ought to make it possible to consolidate peace. The events in the Mediterranean – which have been inappropriately termed the Arab Spring – show that we were not quick enough to grasp what was happening in those countries, and the Union’s foreign policy was unable to prevent situations from developing that were really terrible for millions of people.</p>

An extreme manifestation of this weakness is the activity of the battle groups in Europe. Many years have gone by but so far, these groups have not been used. One might say that the battle groups look very nice, but only on paper. We are making a mistake in Europe in devoting so little effort to military cooperation. There should be significantly broader cooperation in joint planning and in conducting joint military missions and operations. Military action should be connected, and cooperation in the areas of military research and industry should be much broader.

The critical position of Brussels in its relationship with Moscow is undisputed, as is the strategic significance of the Eastern Partnership. We also managed to draft a compromise provision regarding Taiwan, recognising its commitment to the process of maintaining stability in the region. Fundamentally, however, the report proposes that the role of the European External Action Service should be expanded and identifies common defence as one of the objectives.

The most recent report states that Member States’ efforts to enhance conservation and to rebuild fish stocks are insufficient and that little progress has been made on the reduction of fleet capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of this report as it states that, in order to improve the system of fishing restrictions in the 12-nautical-mile waters, a concrete definition of over-capacity must be established at EU level, regional definitions must be accommodated and, finally, efficient data collection mechanisms with long-term management plans for all EU fisheries must be enforced rigorously.</p>

<p class="contents">The system of fishing restrictions in the 12-nautical-mile waters was working well and I think it could potentially be extended to a regime of 10 to 20 miles to more effectively achieve the objectives. Our fishermen need to be better informed as to why certain restrictions might be put in place, as very often self-policing is the only realistic option; overfishing will not be addressed in a proper manner otherwise. We need to interact with RACs and other relevant stakeholders for effective conservation. Furthermore, a mechanism at EU level to compensate fishermen affected by economic or social repercussions as well as by ecosystem protection measures could be established.

We fish too much in Europe, and we often fish badly.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to safeguard marine biological resources, conserve the marine ecosystem and ensure the survival of the fisheries sector, we have to give overexploited fish stocks time to recover. However, the view that prevailed in this Chamber today by only a few votes was the blinkered view of those who want to maintain the status quo and continue to condemn our seas and the whole fisheries sector to certain death.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I voted against the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. We need a well-thought-out reform that allows for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and not a watered-down text that offers no future prospects. We need multiannual management plans and a precise timetable, as well as a network of protected areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome sanctions against those Member States that do not abide by the rules, carry out inadequate controls, exceed their quotas and do not provide reliable data. Greater protection for the fish in our seas means more jobs for European fishermen, but there are some people in this Chamber who have not yet understood that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, as the report states, ‘all too often victims do not report a crime, due to fear, uncertainty, a lack of trust or information’. Moreover, the Commission estimates that the overall cost of crime amounts to EUR 233 billion, and that is due not only to the damage caused by the crimes themselves but also to the lack of appropriate support services to help victims recover and cope with legal proceedings. I strongly support the work done by the Commission and my fellow Members, because winning every citizen’s trust in European justice will require a comprehensive and efficient European legal framework.

This forms part of the EU strategy on a ‘single area of freedom, security and justice’, the aim of which is to effectively protect the exploitative system, by beefing up repressive mechanisms and restricting grassroots freedoms and democratic rights. Criminal prosecution and the terms on which penal justice is dispensed come within the sovereign competence of each Member States and, under a series of euro-unifying acts, are gradually and methodically being ceded to the euro-unifying institutions. For that reason, issues are being selected that touch a sore spot with the workers, such as child protection and protection of victims of crime, in order to establish the apparent need for common Union criminal law in the minds of the people. Furthermore, the provisions of the directive that allow victims to testify without being physically present in court are dangerous. Provisions such as this promote the ‘anti-terrorism’ legislation of the EU and its Member States, by eliminating some of the defendant’s fundamental rights of defence, such as the facility for the defence to test the reliability of the testimony in live proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needs a common and transparent justice system, and should ensure that the rights and protection of victims of crime are strengthened. This Directive constitutes an important step in the construction of a European area of freedom, security and justice. All victims of crime, regardless of the degree of damage suffered, are covered by this directive and should be offered support and protection within their country, as well as in the other Member States.

<p class="contents">Recent estimates put the annual cost of crime to victims, employers, the state and society as a whole in the EU at EUR 233 billion. These costs result not just from the crimes themselves but from the lack of appropriate support for victims. I therefore welcome any effort to strengthen victim’s rights and to provide adequate support services, as these should be seen as cost-effective measures that will positively contribute to facilitating the reporting of crimes, and to maintaining the sustainability of national justice and health systems.</p>

Closer cooperation among Member States and better coordination of actions in respect of victims would help to reduce the negative impact of crimes and the risk of secondary and repeated victimisation and stigmatisation. All victims, regardless of their origin or the harm suffered, should receive free support, and should be treated with respect in a language they understand. According to the concept of victim, support should also be offered to victims’ children and family members. Both during and after criminal proceedings, it is very important for all possible measures to be taken to protect victims’ private and family life. In particular, attention should be drawn to the media, which often encourages victims to feel vulnerable and disoriented, and we therefore need to ensure that the media pursue self-regulatory measures. In order to avoid unintended discrimination, persons with disabilities, women or children who have suffered a sexual assault, victims of terrorism and organised crime, should not be defined as ‘vulnerable victims’, but as ‘victims with specific needs’ and they should be guaranteed specific protection measures, such as provision of shelter, medical support, legal and psychological counselling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to exercise their rights effectively, the victims of crime may need more specific measures and practical and operational tools, especially in certain areas and in the case of vulnerable groups in society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would highlight the comments included in the 2011 Europol report on human trafficking, which clearly points to economic weakness and cultural conditioning as decisive factors in facilitating the operations of criminal organisations. The victims of these operations are often children or women from countries marked by poverty and severe political instability, who are exploited in a wide range of activities from construction to textiles or even begging and prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that long-term situations of cultural and social fragility in certain areas of our countries still foster problems such as domestic violence and crimes against the person, which are very rarely reported or pursued in court. Further measures providing physical and personal protection, immediate support, and legal representation in criminal and civil court cases and in relations with the police are therefore essential for the directive to be properly implemented and for victims to be able to exercise their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, victims of crime should have the strongest rights and legal protection, but that is already afforded in UK law and “minimum standards” at EU level may well create a race to the bottom which makes our criminal justice system weaker.

This protection, as the Commission rightly advocates, should be applied regardless of the nationality of the victim or the place where the crime was committed. Last December in this Parliament we adopted measures aimed at ensuring that all defendants have certain basic rights during criminal cases. It is now time to give the same protection to the victims of crimes, who often feel helpless for that very reason when faced with a process with which they are not familiar and do not understand, in particular when that process takes place in a foreign country. Ensuring appropriate monitoring and protection for victims of crime is a matter of basic justice, and the Commission is on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The free movement of people and goods can only be fully enjoyed if we feel that our rights are safeguarded in any Member State in which we find ourselves. It is vital that we know that, no matter where we are, there is always someone looking after us. When a terrorist attack occurs, identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to trial is a major concern. Everything revolves around the criminal. International organisations often sponsor the defence of terrorists and defend the rights of prisoners. However, most of the victims and their families are forgotten. Apart from being unjust, this is also inhumane. I welcome the presentation of this proposal, which clarifies the rights of citizens as victims of crimes including gender violence, trafficking, rape and terrorism in any EU Member State. I would congratulate the rapporteurs on the excellent work that they have carried out on behalf of the European public, in particular those who, for whatever reason – and it could happen to any one of us – may be victims. This is how a Europe of citizens should be constructed: as a Europe that does not abandon us when we are vulnerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further to this, I agree that victims’ rights not only need to be standardised throughout the whole of the EU but victims must also be made aware of their rights within the framework. For this reason, information and awareness-raising campaigns, research and education programmes and cooperation with civil society agencies should be established by means of well orchestrated campaigns throughout EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they all have one thing in common – they expose people to violence. The proposal for a directive defines the term victims of crime, and this is what we should focus our attention on. It is very important that these persons should have confidence in the administration of justice. For this reason, the European Union should introduce a transparent and uniform legal act which guarantees victims of crime, regardless of their nationality or the country in which the offence took place, minimum protection of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur, that in order to take all possible steps to achieve greater protection of the rights of victims of crime, we should establish a European network for observation and aid to victims with a view to setting up a database of statistics including the number, age, gender and nationality of the victims. This information could certainly be used for further legislative work. It is also necessary for officers who deal with victims of crime to be able to provide specialist support and assistance. I therefore agree that they should undergo training, in cooperation with non-governmental organisations, to help them deal with victims of crime in an appropriate way, having regard to the nature of the crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative comes within – and rounds off – the framework of the 2009 Stockholm Programme, which in 2011 was enhanced with some important new legislative instruments: the directive on the European Protection Order, the directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, and the directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings. The directive follows the framework decision of 2001, which introduced specific requirements favouring victims. I welcome the extension of the definition to include the relatives of victims in a direct line as well. Lastly, I congratulate the rapporteurs on having succeeded in drafting a cross-cutting text that deals with all kinds of victim, while devoting special attention to ‘particularly vulnerable victims’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are 30 million criminal offences recorded annually in the EU each year and all too often victims and their families are denied critical information and support in their time of need. We urgently need a fast and simple EU system for victims, which explains their rights to them, gives them information in their own language and provides essential support to families and victims. This law is a tribute to campaigners like Gary Dunne’s parents and Maggie Hughes, who have turned personal tragedy into a commitment that others will not face the challenges they did. I hope this new law will ensure that vulnerable young women are not subjected to additional trauma in order to get justice. I hope the British Government will maintain its opt-in to this law and not give in to the Eurosceptics, denying British victims of crime vital protection. Labour Euro MPs are committed to strengthening the rights of victims and therefore voted in favour of this report. We will continue our work to ensure that this new law lives up to campaigners’ calls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the basis of the victim protection system as a whole is the simplification of the reporting of crimes, in which care must be taken to eliminate ‘repeat victimisation’. Many criminological and psychological studies point out the fact that many victims do not report the crimes committed against them due to concerns about an insensitive and often impersonal, routine approach taken by law enforcement agencies. We cannot therefore merely state, with regret, that it is mainly victims of human trafficking, sexual abuse against children, sexual exploitation and pornography who are involved: we must move towards the adoption of concrete legal measures that have an EU-wide reach. For these reasons, I support the proposed directive that has been submitted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For rape alone, the percentage is 4.8% – more than a million women. Moreover, 14.3% of women say they have been the victims of violence by their partners: 12% physical violence and 6.1% sexual violence. Of the remaining 24.7%, 9.8% have been the target of physical violence and 20.4% of sexual violence. As many as 2.4% of women say they have been raped by their partners, and 2.9% by strangers. Of the women who claim to have suffered violence from their partners, 93% say they did not report it to the authorities; the proportion rises to 96% when the attacker was not the partner. These figures are appalling and raise a fundamental question that may perhaps find an answer in the resolution we have adopted today. Why is this kind of violence not being reported? It is because the victims do not feel protected. Victim protection programmes are therefore heading in the right direction of providing support for women, as well as for the elderly and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Gender-based violence as well as violence in close relationships is defined for the first time in EU legislation (recital 8f) which is regarded as a huge success due to the fact that Commissioner Reding's proposal was gender blind; in fact the seriousness of gender-based violence was denied, as was the request for a separate directive on gender-based violence. The Greens also managed to highlight and include reference to victims of race, hate or other bias crimes. Another success was our proposals regarding access to victim rights, support and protection without discrimination of any kind, including residence status, and regardless of victim’ participation in criminal proceedings, which were adopted by the rapporteurs and the Commission, and were thus accepted by Council as well. This means that irregular migrants who are victims of crime will have access to the rights, support and protection afforded by the directive, regardless of whether the victim makes a formal complaint of a criminal offence. The agreed wording also adopts the language of the Charter of Fundamental Rights regarding the prohibited grounds of discrimination, which is broader than the five grounds of discrimination protected by the EU equality directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has introduced some amendments which limit the powers of the Commission in relation to the delegation of powers, and advocate Parliament’s greater involvement in the preparation and implementation of delegated acts. We welcome the provision which ensures that Parliament has a longer period of time to object to a delegated act.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this report must still be examined for its deeper meaning, taking into account positions of principle in terms of the TFEU and its provisions on trade policy. Indeed, the Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy is the exclusive remit of the EU. In other words, the Member States have been denied an essential economic policy instrument. Trade interests are obviously different from country to country, as their respective economies, weaknesses and strengths are different. The overlap between the interests of the strongest and the weakest, in this and other areas, is extremely detrimental to weaker economies, such as that of Portugal. The effects of policies of free trade can be seen in the disruption of major national sectors of production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aforementioned regulation confers powers on the Commission to adopt the necessary implementing measures and amend the regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular by decisions to conclude agreements with third countries. Those powers should be aligned with the regime, instituted by the Treaty of Lisbon, of delegated and implementing acts. The rapporteur is therefore proposing the greater involvement of Parliament, the limitation of delegation of powers to tacitly extendable five-year periods, the prolongation of the period for possible objection from two to four months and the modification of the application of written procedure. Moreover, he also advocates that the text of the regulation be brought into line with the so-called ‘Trade Omnibus’ regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur proposes deleting that reference and inserting a new provision on Committee procedure into each of the amended regulations. This way, the modified application of the written procedure, brought about by the ‘Trade Omnibuses’, can be assured.

The rapporteur has introduced some amendments which limit the powers of the Commission in relation to the delegation of powers, and advocate Parliament’s greater involvement in the preparation and implementation of delegated acts. We welcome the provision which ensures that Parliament has a longer period of time to object to a delegated act. However, we must review this report to determine its deeper meaning, taking into account positions of principle in terms of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and its provisions on trade policy. Indeed, the Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that trade policy is the exclusive remit of the EU. Trade interests are obviously different from country to country, as their respective economies, weaknesses and strengths are different. The overlap between the interests of the strongest and the weakest, in this and other areas, is extremely detrimental to weaker economies, as in the case of Portugal, which is in the hands of the trade interests of the big business of the EU’s major powers, in particular Germany, which is often opposed to the interests of national production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The division of power among them helps improve the operation and functioning of the EU. When the three pillar structure ceased to exist, it became necessary to reform secondary EU law. The Treaty of Lisbon achieved this, by making a distinction between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. I want to refer to delegated acts and implementing acts, which are classified by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as non-legislative acts pursuant to Article 290 and Article 291 of the TFEU. Each of these was established for a specific purpose. Delegated acts serve to complement non-essential elements of legislative acts. They are issued by the European Commission under the powers delegated to it pursuant to a legislative act. Such legislative acts should describe the powers granted to the Commission in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I also mentioned implementing acts, which are designed to provide uniform conditions for the implementation of legally binding EU acts. Primary responsibility for the effective implementation of EU law lies with the Member States. However, if uniform conditions for implementation of legally binding EU acts are necessary, those acts shall confer implementing powers on the European Commission or the European Council.</p>

The amendments will allow greater flexibility in the structure of sectoral annexes, remove restrictions on trade between the parties, reduce the administrative burden related to the MRA and clarify the MRA. The restriction concerning the rules of origin of industrial products should be deleted because only then will the MRA apply to all products covered by it. As the Joint Committee is co-chaired by the parties, all references to the Chair of the Joint Committee must be deleted. It is important to stress that the Joint Committee is empowered to amend the sectoral annexes when these take account of technical progress and other factors. In order to simplify operation of the MRA, it is necessary to simplify the procedure for the recognition, withdrawal of recognition and suspension of conformity assessment bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the EU has the responsibility to ensure that this cooperation requirement is respected and that Member States do not take unilateral action in disregard of the general interest in the conservation of the marine ecosystem. However, beside effective measures, in order to fulfil this task it is necessary to endow the EU with appropriate monitoring tools. As with other sectors, unbridled competition among the Member States may have adverse consequences. I have thus chosen to support the measures in the directive, in particular those designed to impose quantitative restrictions on EU fish imports, in cases where the fish is caught from stocks of common interest under the supervision of a third country.

However, unsustainable fishing practices are likely to continue outside the EU. This report therefore calls for the EU to use sanctions against countries who fish unsustainably on fish stocks that are of importance to the EU. This would allow it to prohibit imports of fish that have been caught unsustainably. Given the recent actions taken by Iceland and the Faroe Islands, where they have set themselves mackerel quotas that are way above their historical levels, I can add my support to this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU, the largest fisher of the stock, is willing in principle to agree to this, but negotiations have stalled for several years over the actual amount.

The future Common Market Organisation must also make a positive contribution towards the dynamic development of the EU aquaculture sector in order to better respond to the increase in demand for fish in the context of the reduction in wild fish stocks. The use of modern technology to improve market intelligence should be promoted within the framework of the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and maritime affairs policy. The proposed mechanism for intervening in the EU market is limited to a single storage system. However, any system that interferes with the free market should be treated with great care and should be applied on a cooperative basis, involving all of the producer organisations and allowing as much flexibility as possible, while protecting the interests of marine and island regions that are heavily dependent on fisheries, in particular the outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also includes aspects of prime importance for the health and confidence of consumers in the sector. In this respect, safeguarding the interests of consumers and satisfying their demands for clarity and transparency should be the goal of our common policies, because they can become a way of encouraging people to spend. This is all the more important during a slump in sales, when all the indicators show that people tend to purchase goods in a more conscious and informed way, which means they look for quality. That is why we are firmly convinced that the product packaging should show not the date when the fish were landed but the date on which they were actually caught. The landing date, however, which is supported by the moderates and conservatives, is not only misleading for the consumer but also unduly favours large fleets that are able to stay at sea for several days over smaller vessels that can only stay at sea for a few hours. Once again, we would have expected a more rational attitude from the moderates, who seem to have given in to the interests of the larger groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is expected that a vote on the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reform of the common fisheries policy will only be held next November in the Commission. However, the method of presenting ‘preliminary reports’, although it is more complex and potentially longer, seems to me to be sufficiently effective in a post-Lisbon Europe, where the search for consensus within and among institutions has become crucial in order for legislative documents to actually see the light of day within a reasonable timeframe. Having said that, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he has carried out, and I wish my colleague Ms Rodust, the rapporteur for the joint regulation, the best of luck with the complex piece of work that she has in her hands. As a personal note on this reform, although it does not form part of the Committee on Fisheries, I would simply like to highlight the absolute importance of pursuing the objective of achieving balance between the three dimensions of the common fisheries policy, namely its social, environmental and economic aspects, as well as the maintenance of support for fleet renewal and the pursuit of a more regionalised model for the management of the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place, particular attention should be given to the information provided to the consumer, through clear and simple yet informative labelling. The consumer should know the origin of the product, the date on which it was caught, thawing information, chains of supply and whether its capture complied with sustainable fishing practices. Secondly, producer organisations should be supported and sustainable fishing practices should be commended. Moreover, it is necessary to promote sustainable management of fisheries resources, avoiding the capture of young species and their subsequent return to the marine environment.

In this context, a profound and ambitious reform of the CMO is required, which strengthens public intervention and market regulation instruments, to guarantee incomes in the sector, ensure market stability, improve the marketing of fishery products and increase their added value, by increasing the first-sale price of fish. This report points towards a weakening of the current CMO by dismantling some of the (few) remaining regulatory instruments. The objective is growing liberalisation and market orientation. Given the current state of the sector, this path will prove disastrous for countless fleet segments, particularly for small-scale fishing fleets. We regret that many of the proposals we tabled were rejected, such as: adoption of measures to increase the first-sale price of fish, inter alia by implementing maximum intermediation margins along the sector’s value chain; and establishment of a ‘management option’ which enables Member States to continue making key decisions (now entrusted to producer organisations) at national government level.

The European fisheries policy is an important issue for France as it is sensitive to the vagaries that affect French fishermen. In Parliament, members of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) have had to fight with MEPs of other nationalities, sometimes even with members of their own political group, whose vision of fishing differs greatly from their own. However, the position adopted by Parliament does meet our expectations. Parliament calls for the introduction of a single and public European eco-label for fishery and aquaculture products by 2015, which will enable consumers to be better informed about what they are eating. Consumers must be provided with information about the catch area, the trade name of the product, the date of landing, the term ‘defrosted’ if the product is placed on sale as fresh goods. In addition, Parliament recommends strengthening the role of producer organisations so that they contribute to market stability and price regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aims of the common fisheries policy (CFP) seek to protect the environment better by means of effective regulation in that area. As the report points out, however, it is also crucial to take account of the operators in the sector and the effects on their livelihoods, so as not to allow the new regulations to stifle entrepreneurship and the operators’ ability to compete in the market. I also agree with the initiative to secure greater consultation between transnational producer organisations that share the same commercial characteristics and the same needs. These are the lines along which we should be working, not least when drafting the CFP, although we must also bear in mind the specific features of individual fishing areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first of three legislative reports on the reform of the CFP, dealing with the market in fisheries and aquaculture products. The other two are the basic regulations governing the CFP and the EMFF (subsidies). A Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fisheries and aquaculture products has been in place since 1970. It is one of the pillars of the CFP. Its legal basis is Regulation 104/2000, adopted in 1999, which will be replaced by the current proposal. In its preparation, the COM has concluded that the market has not sufficiently contributed to sustainable production; many EU fisheries are not exploited in a sustainable way and there are few market mechanisms to discourage unsustainable practices and to provide market premiums for sustainable ones. Similarly, it has proved difficult or impossible to anticipate or manage market fluctuations. A very limited consumer label was introduced in 2000 and has been much expanded in the report (now to include better explanation of where the fish comes from - which body of water, the flag of the vessel, inside or outside the EU, etc. )- though we failed to get included the gear type used to catch the fish and an indication of whether the stock is overexploited or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Labels should also carry information about easily identifiable fishing zones to which consumers can relate, unlike the currently used labelling for zones. Fish species should also be identified using locally familiar names on all labels.

The progress achieved by the vote is patchy. On the negative side: this report provides for a market of landed by-catch, and yet this landing has not yet been agreed in the basic regulation. It is, however, necessary to have at our disposal a legal framework, without pre-empting any means which will be implemented to limit, or even eliminate, by-catches. I was, on the other hand, very much in favour of Parliament recognising the need to put European funding for the storage mechanism on a sustainable basis and agreeing to create an eco-label. Producer organisations have also been given greater power and recognition, and can, in particular, become transnational. Finally, the report supports the development of aquaculture, a development that I support providing that we bear in mind that this activity is complementary to fishing and must be set within a framework of strict environmental standards, without promoting the creation of a fish meal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of the reform is further capitalist restructuring of the fisheries sector, by destroying small-scale fisheries, which the current CFP has already achieved to a large degree, and boosting large-scale fishing fleets and aquaculture monopolies. The proposal to restructure the common market in fishery and aquaculture products is designed to further strengthen monopoly groups in the sector. The producer organisations, for which different financing instruments are provided by the EU, will enlarge the monopoly groups and mark the final destruction of poor and average fishermen. It introduces transferable fishing concessions administered by producer organisations, which will enlarge monopoly groups and mark the final destruction of poor and average fishermen, as the monopolies in the area will obtain a large number of licences. The proposed ban on discards will be conducive to a concentration of monopolies in the sector, as only the monopolies have the material and technical processing infrastructure required and poor and average fishermen who cannot meet requirements will disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, the role of producer organisations must be strengthened, as a counter-balance to the power of retailers, prices must be set that are reasonable for the consumer and fair for the fishermen, and fishing quotas must be managed. The sector must of course remain competitive, but not at any price: nobody wants to witness the disappearance of our artisanal fishing, threatened by intensive practices, climate change and market tensions. Fishing is deeply rooted in our culture and our heritage, and I refused to compromise on the protection of our model of fishing and aquaculture. With this vote, Parliament has established an optimal framework to protect our fishermen and manage stocks sustainably, by means of a balanced approach adapted to the specificities of different fishing areas. Furthermore, I supported this report’s major innovation: the creation of a European eco-label, which will guarantee the conservation of fish stocks and ensure the traceability of fishery products from the boat to the plate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In doing so, I continue my efforts to focus on the future role and objectives of producer organisations (POs). Introduced as a counter-balance to the power of retailers, POs have been effective in ensuring realistic prices for the catches landed by their members; however I firmly believe they must be given the correct tools to enable themselves to regulate the activity of their members more effectively. Therefore POs should play a more meaningful role in the day-to-day management of fisheries under a more regionalised system. The strengthening and economic viability of existing POs is equally important. Moreover, criteria must be clearly defined on the minimum number of members and criteria for the formal recognition of POs need to be increased to encourage them to be big enough to be relevant on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This comprehensive approach is essential to constructing a strategic and coherent approach for pursuing the Union’s foreign policy. The 2010 Report of the Council includes important steps in the direction of mapping out the Union’s foreign policy priorities in a forward-looking and strategic framework. However, it falls short of the ambitions of the Lisbon Treaty in important ways, including inter alia by not giving a sense of priorities or strategic guidelines for the CFSP. I believe that, whilst this report is intended to be ambitious and politically strategic, it should also be realistic and pragmatic. Indeed, this report should be a contribution to framing EU foreign policy and to setting benchmarks for monitoring and evaluating progress made over the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that this is very important, particularly in today’s context where the protracted dispute between Japan and China over a chain of islands has recently begun to escalate into open confrontation. It should be highlighted that the existence of Taiwan and its peaceful, non-confrontational policies are important for maintaining stability in the region of the East China Sea, and that Taiwan in general also acts as a stabilising factor. The EU welcomes good relations with Taiwan, which must be developed further. In this context I welcome the resolution’s provision that we must urge the Commission and the Council to take concrete steps to further enhance EU-Taiwan economic relations, and to facilitate the negotiation of an EU-Taiwan economic cooperation agreement. Furthermore, the EU must firmly support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in relevant international organisations and activities, including the World Health Organisation.

It supports the need to strengthen the European Defence Agency, pooling and sharing programmes, full militarisation of the EU Horizon 2020 research programme and common defence measures. It provides full support for the imperialist intervention in Syria, by calling for additional measures in the name of the ‘right of civilians to protection from slaughter by the regime’, as it did in the war in Libya. It tries to pass this new pretext for imperialist interventions off as a UN ‘principle’.

As a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I express my unwavering opinion, in opposition to this report, that the Union should be strictly separated from the NATO war machine, that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which has no democratic or ethical credentials, should be dissolved, that Europe should disarm, that immediate and drastic cuts should be made to arms programmes and military spending and that international law and the UN Charter should be respected. The continuing trend by the prevailing forces in the European Union to equate foreign policy with military power and the NATO military machine with the Union’s prospects are both contrary to its declared values and, at the same time, prevent any effort to bring about a Europe and a world of peace, cooperation and solidarity between states and nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While removing hard-won rights from workers and ordinary people, it takes further steps towards the militarisation of the EU, which will be ‘funded adequately’ in line with its ambitions. After defending the military attack on Libya, the majority of Parliament now wishes to go beyond the ongoing financial and military support of terrorist groups in Syria and take military action in the country.

The problem is that the Union has never thought of itself, Treaty of Lisbon or otherwise, as a major world power. It is constantly pursuing an international political role that it can never attain, because it will not rest until it has destroyed the diplomatic and military capabilities of its members. This is done in the name of a cosy ideology, unadulterated commercialism and a Malthusian budgetary rationale. Europe is neither synergy nor synthesis. It is simply the sum of its weaknesses.

However, the report falls short of the ambitions of the Treaty of Lisbon in important ways, which include not addressing the priorities or strategic guidelines for the common foreign and security policy. The report does not clarify the policy mechanisms for ensuring coherence and consistency among the different components of foreign policy. It avoids the issues of harmonisation of EU resources with our priorities in foreign affairs. Parliament therefore calls on the Vice-President of the Commission to take the lead in adopting high-quality and courageous measures, and also to lay emphasis on European neighbourhood policy in the situation at hand.

Indeed, the report in favour of which I voted in plenary contains an ambitious strategic and forward-looking analysis, in line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon in this regard. In this text, Parliament recommends that the Council introduce policy mechanisms for ensuring the coherence of our external action and benchmarks enabling it to be evaluated, to provide the European External Action Service (EEAS) with the means it needs to fulfil its mission and to provide strategic guidelines and realistic priorities for the CFSP. At these times of economic austerity, we must prioritise actions with high added value. The new European neighbourhood policy, in particular, has been prioritised. Furthermore, on the crucial question of geographical differentiation, it has been noted that the choice of strategic partners deserves careful reflection in the light of the values and objectives of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I supported the principal ambition of this report, which means that, if we want visible and effective European diplomacy, we must rationalise resources and means, and align them with our objectives. We can no longer dispense with this common sense approach, for which I have been calling for a long time. At the same time, we must strengthen cooperation with NATO and national armed forces. In a globalised world, where inter-state relationships between allied countries are based on solidarity, I think that it is pointless to develop our defence capabilities within a strictly national framework, without considering bringing together, or even sharing, means and resources. Further dithering would be extremely dangerous, at a time when there are ever-increasing numbers of flashpoints, human rights violations and threats. With this in mind, I make this appeal to Baroness Ashton: assert yourself as the European Union’s true patroness of Foreign Affairs.

While removing the most basic rights of workers and ordinary people, it calls for EU militarisation to be ‘funded adequately’ in line with its ambitions. After defending the military attack on Libya, the majority of Parliament now wishes to go beyond the ongoing financial and military support of terrorist groups in Syria and take military action against the country.

Recovery plans must be established for all EU and geographical fisheries regions whereby particularities of the various seas would be taken into account and small-scale coastal fisheries would be treated in a separate regime. The current situation is one where short-term national concerns prevail over long-term management and this prevents the overall aim from being achieved. It is very important to set up a framework for decision-making in data-poor situations regarding management plans and total allowable catches (TACs) as well as quota decisions because there is a clear lack of reliable and available data. As the existing provisions of the common fisheries policy (CFP) were not sufficient to address the issue of over-fishing, we need to reform the CFP, set clear deadlines for fleet reductions and pace targets as well as a sanctioning mechanism for Member States which do not comply with the rules. Financial support also needs to be guaranteed for fishermen who face the consequences of identified over-fishing. The adjustment of fleet capacity is another key aspect, which could ensure that sustainable fishing is rewarded. Moreover, preferential access to fishing rights should be granted to ecologically-friendly fishing vessels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The long-term management plans must be clearly defined and based on an ecosystem approach, whereby solutions need to be found for managing mixed fisheries. So long as certain Member States continue to delay informing the Commission of these plans, however, it will remain difficult to identify the areas for intervention with any precision. This will jeopardise the aim of protecting certain threatened species, such as bluefin tuna in our Mediterranean waters. This negligence also adversely affects the release of funding needed for very specific areas of relevant scientific research, and on several occasions Parliament has had to call for defaulting Member States to fulfil their obligations.

Nonetheless, some negative things have crept in, including language reflecting the silly and irrational belief by fishermen that killing seals will bring back the fish stocks.

Moreover, the Commission had the obligation to report on fishing restrictions in the 12 nautical miles zones by 31 December 2011. The Commission states that Member States’ efforts to enhance conservation and to rebuild fish stocks have been insufficient and that there has been equally little progress in the reduction of fleet capacity. The system of fishing restrictions in the 12 nautical miles waters is working well and could potentially be extended to a regime of 10-20 miles. Parliament’s position is that, although the establishment of multiannual and recovery plans is widely accepted, overfishing has not been diminished enough. It believes a definition of overcapacity at EU level and a specific definition at regional level are required. It also recognises that the principle of relative stability has encouraged Member States to focus on their own national share rather than on the collective long-term benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This own-initiative report is satisfactory because it has allowed us to move the debate on the common fisheries policy (CFP) forward, particularly by highlighting the consensus in Parliament on the need to improve data collection, an essential prerequisite if we are to arrive at a sound definition of the CFP’s objectives at a time when the status of some fish stocks is still unknown. However, it is only one vote in the process. This report also points out the need to go in the direction of greater decentralisation, at a time, in particular, when the Commission has stated that there are too many ships in the European fleet compared with available fish stocks. Yet it does not study the realities of each coastline and the different fish stocks found there. The report also notes that one of the prime priorities of the CFP should be jobs, because without fish, there is no fishing, and without fishermen, neither is there any fishing. Finally, Parliament has noted that transferable fishing concessions should be an optional management measure, and recognised that the obligation to land by-catch should be adjusted to the realities of each fishery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a clear need for specific measures for certain regions, such as the island regions and outermost regions. Furthermore and above all, the common fisheries policy should be a holistic, cross-disciplinary and inclusive policy, which is not the case, as some European territories do not share the same sea basins as the European continent. The outermost regions should therefore be grouped together and represented on an advisory committee created specifically for this purpose. Restrictive measures under the common fisheries policy need to be adapted to the actual state of fish stocks. For these reasons, a financial instrument to support the sector must remain in place and continue to be based on the principle of intensifying aid for cofinanced measures in the outermost regions. I also emphasise that transferable fishing concessions could lead to fishing rights being concentrated in the hands of a small number of operators and thus result in the disappearance of numerous small-scale fishing enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I supported two amendments to this document, the first of which proposed allocating subsidies from the EU budget to renovate fishing vessels (these subsidies were suspended in 2002, i.e. before Lithuania joined the EU). The second amendment proposed increasing fish quotas. During the vote in plenary the first amendment was rejected while the second was adopted. The reform of fisheries policy, which was approved in 2002 and which is still being implemented, did not provide the fishing fleets in any of the new EU Member States with subsidies for fleet renewal, putting them in a very difficult position. The majority of vessels that needed to be repaired were broken up. With this reform the old EU Member States eliminated potential competitors from the market, forgetting that fishing is not just a source of jobs and income for people in the new EU Member States, but a tradition and way of life. Lithuanian fishermen suffered damages including financial losses. Unfortunately, the majority of MEPs did not approve the amendment on subsidies for the renewal of fishing vessels in EU Member States. I therefore voted against this document, expressing my opposition to the proposed reform of the EU’s CFP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to ensure that the measures chosen better meet regional and local needs, the Member States themselves should choose the most appropriate safeguards. I agree that we need to prohibit the discarding of unwanted fish and ensure that consumers are given all the necessary information about the quality and sustainability of the products they buy. Financial support should be given to environmentally friendly initiatives and a strict control system should be established in order to ensure that illegal activities do not receive funding.

There should be a new CFP. In future, the European Union will set a general framework for a policy of the sea and fishing activity, in partnership with the Member States and major coastal areas and, with the assistance of the actors on the ground, solutions will be adjusted locally. The EU and the Member States must provide the producer organisations with the means they need to play a more important role, introducing production and marketing plans, to give them greater influence over distributors. Consumers must also be better protected. That is why producers will be required to put the date of unloading on labels along with other information such as the status of the fish stocks, the catching sector and the fishing methods used.

This cannot be delayed any longer. We must preserve our fisheries resources by protecting stocks. However, this reform cannot be implemented without involving the industry or by working against it. We must promote the sustainability of resources while ensuring jobs and the survival of small fishing communities, which are often responsible for maintaining the planet’s biodiversity. To promote a sustainable fisheries regime, the next CFP should consider: medium- and long-term management plans; a ban on catching young fish and their consequent return to the aquatic environment; a reflagging ban on countries permitting non-sustainable fishing; international cooperation, especially as regards enforcement; the involvement of fishermen’s organisations; and scientific studies on stocks. I voted for this report because we need a CFP that preserves fish stocks but also promotes social sustainability, especially in the midst of a crisis in which job creation is scarce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, other proposals were weakened or even withdrawn in this vote in plenary. One such example is support for the renovation and modernisation of fishing fleets. The report rejects mandatory transferable fishing concessions, as proposed by the Commission. The report falls far short of what is needed in its review of our centralised common fisheries policy, which has prevailed in the last two decades, and in promoting proximity management, which goes beyond the (inconsequential) ‘regionalisation’ proposals tabled by the Commission and the greater involvement of regional advisory councils. Unfortunately, our proposals in this area were not accepted, inter alia expanding the area reserved for the exclusive access of Member States’ fleets.

Indeed, it should be remembered that the previous common fisheries policy (CFP) did not meet some of its main objectives: many stocks are still overfished, the economic situation of parts of the European fleet is still fragile despite subsidies, jobs are still being lost in the fishing sector, and they are unattractive to young people entering the sector, and the situation of many coastal communities depending on fishing and aquaculture is still precarious.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime objective is to ensure the supply of fish to the public and the development of coastal communities, by promoting employment and better working conditions for fishing professionals.

The fisheries reform in these regions should therefore focus on ensuring the survival and prosperity of small-scale coastal fishing and on achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion objectives, such as promoting employment.

This non-binding report is acceptable insofar as its content anticipates and influences forthcoming debates on the basic CFP Regulation. It has enabled us to make some progress on the Commission’s proposals, which is important for future negotiations, and which, I hope, will allow for further improvements. In the face of the EU’s very controversial proposal to introduce transferable fishing concessions, a tool for liberalising the fishing industry, Parliament spoke in particular in favour of a voluntary system, allowing Member States to decide whether to implement it or not, which is an encouraging start. Parliament also noted that we should reach the maximum sustainable yield by 2020, and not exceed it, a notion thought to be too vague. The proposal to land all by-catches, which the industry has great difficulty in implementing because of technical constraints, has also been watered down, in favour of a gradual implementation on a case-by-case basis, depending on the characteristics and realities of the different fisheries. There should be further discussion about the technical feasibility of implementing such a measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fishing industry is of strategic importance in terms of the public supply of fish and the food balance in various Member States and in the European Union itself, and it makes a considerable contribution to socio-economic well-being in coastal communities, local development, employment, the preservation and creation of economic activities upstream and downstream and the preservation of local cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is the world’s fourth-biggest producer; nevertheless, the EU imports over 60% of the fish it consumes. I think the CFP must apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management and ensure the sustainable exploitation of living marine biological resources in order to restore and maintain the populations of all stocks of harvested species at levels that are close to those capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. We call on the Commission to provide for the establishment of long-term management plans for all EU fisheries and for the use of the ecosystem approach as a basis for all such plans, with clearly defined objectives and harvest control rules playing a pivotal role in each plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a solution should be offered for this scenario which finds a balance between the development of the industry, its impact on the environment, and social interests in the long term. Renovation of fleets does not automatically lead to increased fishing capacity. If a fleet is completely worn out and old, modernisation measures alone are not enough to fulfil the requirements with regard to safety, environmental protection and fuel economy.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreas Mavroyiannis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, honourable Members, let me first thank you for your kind comments on the success of the meeting in Paphos. We are looking forward to continuing until the end of the Cyprus Presidency, providing both hospitality for meetings but also substantial meetings that will contribute to moving forward our common European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to begin this debate by stating that the Presidency is well aware of the concerns that have been expressed by many Members of this Parliament at recent political developments in Romania over the last few weeks and months. Given the implications of some of the actions and decisions taken at the highest political level in Romania, it is very understandable that this Parliament has not only followed developments closely, but has also wished to express its profound unease.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Parliament, the Council has not discussed this issue. You will appreciate that, since as a Presidency I speak on behalf of the Council as a whole, it follows that my contribution to this afternoon’s debate will necessarily be limited. I would, however, like to make some more general comments and offer some reflections which are relevant to the wider context. I hope these will also clarify the situation from the point of view of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly and importantly, I would like to stress one point which is well known to all of us – that the European Union is founded on a number of basic values and principles which are set out in the treaties. These values and principles, which include freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are also enshrined in the constitutional traditions of all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council attaches particular importance to ensuring that these values and principles are fully respected. I know that this House also fully shares that view. However, there has been no suggestion – either within or outside the Council – that any procedure involving the Council linked to the respect for the values on which the European Union is founded, should be invoked in the light of recent events in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States are required to ensure that their legislation respects the basic values on which the EU is founded. But the rule of law and democratic values have not only to be enshrined in the texts, but also put into practice. That means that the legislation has to be respected and enforced. If there are any concerns or doubts that this is not the case, this is firstly a matter for the Commission. I know that the Commission has raised its concerns in various contacts with different parties within Romania. The undertaking given to the Commission by the Romanian Government to act swiftly to ensure respect for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary will certainly be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">On a separate note, and though legally not linked with Schengen accession, I am sure that the Commissioner will wish to say more about the concerns which the Commission raised with the Romanians and which are set out in the Commission’s latest report under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism which it adopted on 18 July. The Council is expected next week to take a view on this report as a whole and recall that the existence of an impartial, independent and effective administrative and judicial system is indispensable for EU policies to function properly and for citizens to benefit from all the opportunities offered by membership of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will understand that I am not able at this stage to make a more detailed contribution to this debate, given that the Council has not adopted a position on this issue. I can, however, assure Members that I will listen with particular interest and attention to your comments and reactions to this issue. Let me finish by greeting the presence of Vice-President Reding and the Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, honourable Members, at the beginning of this summer we witnessed a combination of actions by the Romanian authorities, which called into question the rule of law, democratic checks and balances and the independence of the judiciary. We have built our Europe on judicial independence and on the respect for the rule of law. Those are fundamental values for our Union and the Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, has a duty to see that they are respected by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear about the nature of the concerns the Commission expressed during the summer. They concerned respect for constitutional norms and judicial independence. They concerned the rule of law, because in Romania laws and emergency decrees were passed against constitutional practice with the aim of reducing democratic checks and balances, notably by imposing sudden limits to the powers of the constitutional court. At the same time, judges and prosecutors were subject to intimidation and pressure by political forces. Let me be very clear on the following: pressure on the judiciary is unacceptable regardless of which side of the political spectrum it comes from. That is why the Commission reacted swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 July, in a press release, the Commission expressed concerns about the developments in Romania. On 11 July I met the Romanian Justice Minister in Brussels and President Barroso met Prime Minister Ponta the day after to share the Commission’s concerns about the developments in Romania. As a result of our exchanges, the Romanian Government made a number of important commitments in response to the eleven specific points that we had raised. The Romanian authorities addressed some of our concerns and, in particular, restored the constitutional norms, notably in the run-up to the referendum to impeach President Băsescu on 29 July. The referendum, unfortunately, did not bring an end to the political strife.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the referendum there was again evidence of pressure on judges and of prosecutors’ attempts to influence the circulation of the referendum turnout. President Barroso again set out the Commission’s concern in a letter to Prime Minister Ponta on 10 August. In this letter the Commission called upon the Romanian Government to cooperate fully with the constitutional court and to act swiftly and decisively on allegations of intimidation against judges.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also recall that the Venice Commission echoed the Commission’s concern. The President of this Venice Commission stated on 7 August and I quote: ‘it is a general principle of the rule of law that pressure on any court, whether constitutional or ordinary, in order to influence its decisions, is inadmissible’ and he also appealed to ‘all state authorities and political parties of Romania to fully respect the independence of the constitutional court and to refrain from exercising pressures’.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 August the decision of the constitutional court to declare invalid the referendum for the impeachment of President Băsescu was respected by all mainstream political forces. This is an important step because it provides an opportunity for the normalisation of political life. In this context the Commission urges all political forces to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Romanian people deserve a political discourse based on policy arguments, not on personal attacks. I hope that the coming weeks and months will show that all political actors in Romania are determined to fully respect the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in a sustainable and irreversible way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation in Romania remains fragile and requires our attention and support. Since Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007, the Commission has a particular responsibility – as the Minister has just said – to monitor progress on the rule of law and the judicial independence in Romania under the cooperation and verification mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The political developments in Romania over the summer were of particular relevance to this monitoring exercise. The Commission therefore set out in detail its concerns in its report on Romania, which was adopted by the Commission on 18 July. Not all concerns and recommendations by the Commission regarding the rule of law and judicial independence have been addressed. The Commission will therefore continue to closely monitor the situation in Romania and maintain close contact with the Romanian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming days President Barroso and I will be seeing President Băsescu. President Barroso will receive Prime Minister Ponta and I will receive the new Romanian Minister of Justice. Before the end of the year the Commission will prepare a report on Romania within the cooperation and verification mechanism, as announced in July. In this report we will critically assess whether the rule of law and the stability of institutions have been restored in Romania and whether confidence lost over the summer has been regained by the necessary cooperation among all political actors.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that this Parliament shares the Commission’s conviction that the rule of law and judicial independence are at the heart of the European Union and must be respected with impartiality in all 27 EU Member States. That is why the Commission calls on all political forces in this House and outside this House to act with responsibility and restraint in order to contribute to a stabilisation of the political situation in Romania. All political actors will have to contribute to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress. An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation. The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored. Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete. To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process.</p>
<p class="contents">As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world. However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union. These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable. I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania. On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union. This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind. Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance. The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this.</p>

I never heard anything like this from you, Mr Weber, or from Mr Daul in the case of Hungary. The same Mr Orbán, who is still the Vice-President of your party, naturally came down on the side of Băsescu, exerting external influence on the decision by the people of Romania, or at least attempting to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, I hold you in great esteem on many counts. However, your observations have once again called into question the objectivity of the Commission. I find that regrettable. You have several times on other occasions referred to a parliamentary coup. This is a contradiction in terms in itself. It is not a coup, however. In Lithuania, a democratically elected president has been dismissed by parliament without a referendum. In the Romanian case, a referendum was held, and there was no talk of a coup at the time. Now we are hearing the word coup being used.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, Mr Weber, Mr Băsescu introduced the 50% provision just before the referendum, in fact while the campaign was still in progress, because he knew what to expect. I am opposed to such measures. Nonetheless, I clearly stated prior to the referendum that it would be necessary to stick to this figure of 50% afterwards. I am very pleased that the government has kept its promise and that this has been changed. The fact is that Mr Ponta is keeping to his promises. It is scandalous to speak of a coup in this context. That is not true. Also, Ms Reding and Mr Weber, why is it that you said nothing in all the months prior to this when Mr Băsescu and his people ruled by emergency decree? What Mr Băsescu did with emergency regulations was alright because they were nothing new. I did not hear any complaints from the Commission either. Then suddenly you turn around and say that this is a scandal. The fact is that when Mr Băsescu and his people did the same thing, it was not a scandal. That is not being objective, and what I demand is objectivity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all very interesting: Mr Băsescu was elected with 5.3 million votes. 7.4 million have now rejected him. That is very interesting. Is it not one of the functions of the president of a state to ensure that people come together in reconciliation? That is not the way of this particular state president. I agree with you, Ms Reding, in that I, too, would like to see all sides play their part here. However, I see no sign of Mr Băsescu playing his part. After all, a figure of 7.4 million means that 2 million more people have now tried to dismiss him from office than voted for him in the first place. You must take note of how popular and how effective a president is when the majority of the population has voted to dismiss him, except for those who boycotted the referendum, because this boycott, which he and Mr Orbán supported, was the only chance he had to survive. I am not concerned with whether this is right or wrong. I simply want to point out that here a man has failed to carry out his duty as president of the country. Many Romanians have recognised this and many continue to do so.

From this recent episode no party, the European Union included, emerges with much credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, this was not in any sense a coup d’état, even in your phrase ‘a parliamentary coup d’état’. A majority of Members of a democratically elected assembly voted to impeach a President with a long history of abusing his office, for trying to turn a parliamentary democracy into a presidential fiefdom. The constitutional court declared the procedure for suspending the President to be constitutional. The President himself accepted the procedure when he went to Parliament to answer questions.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened then is almost the stuff of fairy tales. It leads many of us to agree with Emil Constantinescu in his letter to President Schulz that the current mandate of the President of Romania is unlawful. In Romania, appointments to public positions are too often partisan. The President has protected his post by placing his pals in positions of power. Transparency International, Freedom House and others have warned against the gradual reversal of the rule of law. Not for the first time, President Băsescu faced impeachment. When he had the referendum law changed, against the advice of the Venice Commission, his friend the Ombudsman rejected a petition to challenge the move at the constitutional court.</p>
<p class="contents">In no other EU country is a vote invalid if fewer than half the people participate. So why did the Commission insist on it for Romania? In any other country, if over 85% vote for a president to go, that president is toast.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the problem is that the European People’s Party, keen to boost its majority position, has welcomed into its fold people such as Berlusconi, Borisov and Băsescu – Europe’s B team, playing fast and loose with the rule of law but all part of the EPP and all protected by the EPP. Europe’s Socialists have decided to move their congress this year from Bucharest to Brussels. We know the EPP has no such sense of shame since they gave Prime Minister Orbán a five-minute standing ovation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They are on the same slippery slope with Saakashvili. I remind you of the words of your own Konrad Adenauer: God placed limits on man’s wisdom but not on his stupidity. Unless all Europe’s parties are scrupulous in their insistence on the finer points of democracy and the rule of law, Europe’s future is in peril.</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing for Romania would be new elections both for Parliament and the President, following the advice of the Venice Commission, and then a convention between all parties to set some ground rules about how to behave in a democracy. And the European Union, Commissioner Reding, might also reflect on the advantage of parliaments over presidential systems.</p>

I am not sure that we are doing any favours to European values and European democracy by allowing this debate to descend into an extension of the Romanian election campaign, which has already begun. I would like to pick up on a comment made by Mr Watson. You said that, whether debating on Hungary or Romania, we were dealing with countries that had not really made a full transition from communist regime to European democracy. I completely agree. However I believe that Mr Ponta is also one of the players who has not made this transition. The parallels I see between Hungary and Romania are simply that a political majority, when it feels securely in power, will not hesitate to reorganise the institutions of the state to such an extent that independence from the majority power in the government in Parliament is lost. I certainly see a parallel with what we discussed regarding Hungary, although the situation is different.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have this instrument, the cooperation and control process that has allowed us to take a closer look with the help of the Commission, shows that we have long known that something was not right with the rule of law and the whole campaign against corruption in Romania, as well as Bulgaria, where the same instruments also exist. The same goes for President Bǎsescu. Hence my insistence. It is good that the Commission has now taken a closer look at Romania. I would be very pleased if we had such measures available for the EU as a whole, so we would not find ourselves again and again facing a situation where it is claimed that we have no powers or authority or that we are guilty of playing party politics when we focus attention on a particular party that belongs to a large party grouping in this House, whether on the left or right.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am frequently ashamed to see how the large party groupings are really fellow travellers with non-democrats in the European Union. If this practice does not stop, I am pessimistic about the development of the rule of law, which Ms Reding has upheld in this case, but also in Hungary, despite the opportunities that were open to us there.</p>

However, the impact is not only nationwide, even though, by its action, the socialist majority in Bucharest added to the European economic crisis an extensive political crisis in one of the Member States. In fact, the events of 3-6 July caused confusion, given that they dramatically brought into opposition the European and national policy discourse.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, what can Europeans do when a country’s majority becomes tyrannical, dismissing the Ombudsman, the Presidents of the Parliament’s Chambers and the Head of State in just three days, in contempt of the Constitution? How should I react when the Parliament in Bucharest requests the Constitutional Court to rule on the President’s suspension within 24 hours? What can I say when the majority members of the Romanian Parliament are lodging criminal complaints against European MPs for having criticised their country’s government? How should I react when Romanian citizens working or studying in one of the other 26 Member States are being denied the right to vote? Is it not absurd when a politician believes the electoral list should be established after and not prior to the citizen consultations?</p>
<p class="contents">The entire European public opinion was concerned with such questions in July and August. The Commission’s intervention was prompt, in support of those Romanian institutions which could stop the drift of the majority and, for this reason, we must thank the Commission. I too wish to do so, on behalf of those Romanian citizens who do not perceive the European identity as a burden, but as enriching the national identity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not the interpretation given in his turn by Victor Ponta, the Romanian Prime Minister. Accused of plagiarism by the same University that had awarded him the title of Doctor a decade ago, Mr Ponta did not have the courage to come here today and explain why he has not answered all the requests made by the European Commission. Instead, he chose to stay in Bucharest and criticise the Commission, using that nationalist and populist discourse which, as President Barroso said this morning, is a denial of Europe. Such a politician embodies the past, not the present. For this reason, I demand his resignation. </p>

Here – and if not here, then where? – you must tell us why the vote of 8.4 million European citizens did not count at all for you this summer; why a rule that is valid nowhere else, in no other Member State of the European Union, was imposed on Romania by the Commission, and I am referring to the 50% voter turnout; how a decision made by six of the seven political groups forming the national Parliament ended up being considered a parliamentary putsch.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, with all due respect, this summer you acted as if you were one of Traian Băsescu’s electoral agents. You were precisely as you reveal yourself today, with that orange jacket you are wearing: namely, an impeccable member of the Liberal Democratic Party (PDL), supporting Traian Băsescu unconditionally. By the statements you have made, you have caused serious damage to Romania, not only politically, but also economically. You managed to humiliate an entire people, tread on the sovereignty of a Member State of the European Union and annihilate the right of a national Parliament to make its own decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps you care to explain to us today how a referendum, in other words, a popular vote – and the decisions of the Constitutional Court have indicated beyond any doubt that the referendum had been organised in compliance with the Constitution and the existing legislation – has been turned into a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner Reding, I wish to congratulate you on creating a very dangerous precedent in the European Union: you managed to impose a head of state on a Member State of the European Union against the will of the very people of that State. There are another 26 EU Member States. The question remains for my fellow Members, when elections are held in their countries, whether they will be able to count on Ms Reding’s support, as we did this summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what it is about, Ms Reding. It is about the principles and values you have reminded us of, which Romanians, and not only Romanian politicians, but also the citizens of Romania, abide by. I would like to remind you of one of the fundamental obligations of the leaders of the European Union and of its citizens – namely, to protect democracy, cultural diversity and the organisation of the public powers of the Member States at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you tell me, Ms Reding, specifically which are the constitutional provisions violated by the suspension procedure, which is stipulated in the Constitution of the Romanian state? Because the decision of the Constitutional Court states very clearly that the constitutional procedures have been complied with during this suspension procedure and the Constitutional Court of Romania validated the constitutional procedure. Moreover, this procedure was validated by the Romanian people, as 7.4 million persons voted for the president’s dismissal. Of course, Ms Reding, people may not count for some of you in the European Union. However, people do count for the great majority of us sitting in this chamber, Ms Reding, and I wish to remind you of the words of Jean Monnet, who said that more Europe will not be achieved by building a coalition of states, but by uniting people. This summer’s events, your brutal intervention in legitimate constitutional and legal procedures of the Romanian state, have only managed to divide people.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, as a liberal politician, I stand for ‘more Europe’. I support a Europe of diversity and I am convinced that together we will be stronger. But we will not be stronger, Ms Reding, through a manifest political partisanship. We will never be stronger if we favour our ideologies and political families. We will be stronger, Ms Reding, when we know what cultural diversity is, when we learn a little about the countries we are criticising, when we respect their traditions and, especially, when we respect the fundamental principles of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has become <span class="italic">very</span> clear how the cards are being placed on the table. On this occasion, Mr Weber from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) praised Ms Reding to the skies in terms of the investigation that she is carrying out in Romania and Mr Swoboda says that the popularity of the Romanian President is suffering a huge setback as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We are taking sides and that is happening because we have still not laid down a basic rule, namely that the Copenhagen criteria should also apply to countries that are already members of the European Union. We keep stealing a march on each other in this House and suggesting that these are party political debates because we are refusing to assess people in terms of how they need to be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is: if the elections are held on 9 December, will the results of the investigations by Ms Reding come before us in time? Or should we just wait for those elections without any further facts and look on as these undemocratic trends unfold? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what the Commission has stated and what Ms Reding has repeated to us. The Venice Commission is also extremely concerned, as is the President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman in place in Romania has been revoked without any legal grounds. A few days later, emergency decrees were passed with the aim of reducing the remit of the Constitutional Court. A new Ombudsman was appointed, close to those in power. I am not going to repeat what my fellow MEPs have said, and yet the fact remains that we are extremely concerned within the European Union about what has been happening since the new social-liberal ruling coalition came to power.</p>
<p class="contents">All mechanisms of democratic control have been undermined, from the impartial Ombudsman to the Constitutional Court, with total disregard for procedures in force, and even electoral regulations. The referendum was held. I am now told that a certain number of investigations have been carried out in Romania. I have been told that several hundred thousand votes are alleged to have been in all cases fraudulent. We can understand there to be haste to move towards new policies when there is a change of government. Changes of government are familiar to us in all the countries of Europe. In my country, France, my government fell and the Socialists came to power, but that took place properly, without any change in legal regulations. Why have the Socialists not come to power properly in Romania, like in other European countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Reding, Mr Barroso, I call on you today to ensure that the rule of law is upheld. That is your duty. That is what you must do and I call on the new ruling coalition to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy in Europe cannot be bought and sold. I call on the socialist group to make sure that it keeps its word and its commitments. Democracy is at the heart of our Europe, and at the heart of the European Union. Today we have visitors in this House, and I wonder what they think of what you have done in your country.</p>

This crisis is not only financial or economic, it also affects trust between Member States, given that one of the aspects of the crisis consists in the community method having been displaced by an intergovernmental method in which some governments, as in Orwell’s <span class="italic">Animal Farm</span>, are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, distrust is spreading between Member States and among public opinion in Member States. For that reason, it is good that Parliament debates this issue, because it affects the role of Parliament, which should concern itself with citizenship, fundamental rights and the quality of democratic standards, whilst also ensuring the Commission safeguards those standards fairly and without double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the events, it appears that a solid parliamentary majority initiated the referendum. The Constitutional Court has validated the referendum process and, despite being very significant, the results are not effective, given that the legally required quorum was not reached.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear is that a large majority of Romanian citizens do not wish President Băsescu to continue in the role. On that basis, the Romanian Government should make themselves available for dialogue with the Commission and cooperate to clarify all the possible relevant information for the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, however, that there is not even a whiff of double standards, neither in terms of corruption among Member States, nor in terms of taking part in the free movement of persons provided by the Schengen area, given that Parliament has repeatedly provided its support and backing for Romania and Bulgaria to join, nor in any other area, even as regards ensuring the Copenhagen criteria are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, you must be aware that the Copenhagen criteria are used not only for joining the European Union, but also for being a member on the same footing as everyone else and thereby deserving the ongoing respect of everyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need new, faster and more efficient procedures to counter violations of European values quickly, not just the procedure under Article 7, as it is being used in relation to Hungary here in this House at present, but also the control process that the Commission uses. Everything takes so long and we are making no real progress against violations in the areas of human rights, democracy and the media in the Member States of the EU. We need to go further.

<p class="contents">Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society. That is why it is so important to debate the current situation in Romania, which is taking on worrying proportions as a result of a power struggle and an unprecedented war between its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this conflict a majority has tried to take over and dominate all the other bodies, including the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the other institutions, and bend them to its will, while overstepping and sweeping away the balance between the powers, offices and institutions. It is strange that a certain part of this Parliament that always takes an interest in the level of democracy and freedom in the countries that make up the Union appears indifferent on this occasion or is even trying to justify the situation.</p>

I agree with him. Yet neither President Barroso, nor Commissioner Reding reacted when the Hungarian Parliament amended the constitution in November 2010 and limited the powers of the constitutional court. The reason for the amendment was that one month earlier the constitutional court had annulled a new law put forward by the government. Calling court judgments in question and removing the fundamental checks and balances casts doubt on the government’s commitment to the rule of law, said José Manuel Barroso to Prime Minister Victor Ponta in July 2012. I agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Commission did not react when the <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> Government annulled court judgments, rearranged the electoral districts to its own benefit, appointed its own people as heads of independent institutions, and adopted 365 laws over a span of one and a half years while disregarding even the most basic rules of social consultation and parliamentary discourse. In his statement made in January this year Joseph Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) states that Mr Orbán will prove that he is committed to freedom rights and the values and principles of democracy. Upon the visit of Victor Ponta to Brussels in July this year, Mr Daul said that they strongly doubted that the diplomatic statements made by Prime Minister Ponta in Brussels would be followed by concrete action on the part of his government.</p>
<p class="contents">Double standards have no place in Europe; we must take joint action to protect democracy and the rule of law when they are under attack in a Member State, regardless of whether it is under conservative or left-wing leadership. I find it unacceptable that Commissioner Reding, who did not raise her voice against the violation of the rules of democracy in connection with the earlier actions of President Băsescu, is in the present situation making political judgments and is threatening Romania with a postponement of its Schengen accession while both the experts and the Commission found the country to be ready for accession in every respect. We have a right to expect objectivity from the Commission. This requires a monitoring mechanism that utilises impartial expert opinions to provide us with appropriate tools to investigate and sanction Member State measures violating democracy and the rule of law at Community level.

The European Union cannot ignore any intervention in the independence of the judicial system, for example in the separation of powers, and it cannot allow any suspicions surrounding fundamental rights in the Member States. The EU citizens require that kind of confidence. It is in the spirit of our Treaties, it is spelt out right there in Article 2 of our Treaties, and we cannot ever forget that the judge of an EU Member State, a Romanian judge, is also a European judge who will judge other EU citizens. As a matter of mutual trust, we must be able to rely on the separation of powers in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur on fundamental rights in Hungary. Hungarian citizens, the Hungarian Government and journalists all ask me if we will apply the same standards to other EU Member States, and their questions are justified. There must be no discrimination. I think it is essential that this Parliament and the Commission stop living under the illusion that, once a Member State has acceded to the European Union, its fundamental rights record suddenly becomes impeccable. This could never be the case and we must end this asymmetry, in which financial violations lead to the Troika visiting EU countries while fundamental rights violations pass without consequence, by continuously monitoring the EU’s Member States. This is what we need to think about and implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved this now. We thank the Commission and the European Parliament for their support during the pre-accession period and afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The prosecutors and judges who are handling cases against politicians are the ones being praised today; they are the ones who have been acknowledged in each report of the European Commission regarding the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. They are not handling political cases; on the contrary, they are investigating any member of the government. I wish to emphasise this because, in reality, what has happened in Romania was aimed at stopping these investigations and holding justice captive in the back garden of certain political parties. Therefore, it is extremely important to return to this state of normality.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, prosecutors and judges are investigating referendum frauds, following certain claims. There are over 500 cases. Let me give you just a few figures: one of the cases involves allegations regarding 1.5 million votes stolen during the referendum and, several days ago, the Chief-Prosecutor of the National Anticorruption Directorate stated that leads and evidence of fraud amounting to 5-10-15% have been found in the investigated polling stations. These files must, therefore, be finalised, these prosecutors must continue to hold office, in spite of the efforts being made to dismiss them, and we must see the result of these investigations. Voting fraud is the vilest form of corruption because it is directed against the people. </p>

Only three weeks later were these allegations formulated, although it is clear that, despite what has been said here, the procedure for suspending the President of Romania, like the initiative of 2007, complied with the Constitution and the decisions of the Constitutional Court. Unfortunately, this time around, the European Commission adopted the position of President Băsescu’s political ally, instead of that of a neutral mediator in an election process, in a domestic political dispute, blaming, from the very beginning, both the government and the democratically elected Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have not seen you in the debate on safeguarding democracy in Hungary, but I see that now you intend to make a completely groundless analogy between these two countries. For years, you have ignored the signs of the abuses committed by the PDL government. You have brought up two emergency ordinances of the Ponta government without saying a single word about the hundreds of emergency ordinances abusively issued by the PDL government. The double standard you are applying to the Romanian internal political groups is so obvious that it is no wonder the Romanian citizens’ confidence in the European Union has dropped by 10% in one month alone during this summer. </p>

I am truly amazed and surprised by the statement made by Mr Watson, a liberal democrat leader in this Parliament, that the majority has a right to impose its view and the right to decide what the truth is, as is the case in dictatorships. Mr Watson, protection of the rights of minorities is a cornerstone of liberal democracy. We now have a situation where a majority of Romanians rejects the Romanian Ombudsman, introduces changes, challenges the constitutional court, and wants to dismiss the President. The majority is not right only by virtue of being the majority. What is right is right, but not because it enjoys a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to add one more comment – there can be no comparison between Romania and Hungary. In Hungary, the socialist party has, along with its once-liberal coalition partner, led the country to ruin. It has been rejected by the vast majority of the nation in a clear manner. Two thirds of the Parliament – two thirds went over to the Fidesz Party. These two thirds had the authority under the constitution to introduce constitutional amendments. There is a big difference between two thirds and half or less than half in a referendum when it comes to making changes such as dismissing a president.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a Romanian exception. In Poland, a referendum is valid only if half the population participates in it, since the alternation of power is a principle of democracy and either we defend such principles or else we will end up governed by the law of the jungle or the steppe – might is right. Such customs are not European, they belong to the steppe. Socialists and liberals, remember this.</p>

However there are rules. If the suspicion exists that existing laws and the values of the European Union are being violated, then this is something that must be pursued, whether in Hungary and Romania, or in France or Denmark, or any other country that could give cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder, however, not just in view of the present debate, whether all those involved are really concerned with an objective clarification of events, or whether they are not more interested in party political mud-slinging or scoring party political points through sound-bites. This will not help us win back the confidence of our citizens. We need to arrange for an objective investigation to be carried out, using the same yardstick for all Member States, rather than different standards depending on whether we are located in the north, south, east or west of the European Union. If we consider the issue at the heart of these matters rather than relying on rumours and newspaper reports, then this discussion will have added value for the people of Hungary, Romania, France and Germany, and everyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Băsescu’s regime was based on a parallel system of personal power. It was the same old story – using intelligence services, the police, and the office of the prosecutor to spy on citizens, to intimidate political opponents and protect friends. The mafia, corruption and clientele were closely associated with this parallel system that was finally challenged by a popular reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did not lift a finger against all these abuses. Romania got a new parliament that started an impeachment process which it carried out according to constitutional rules. At this point the Commission intervened, endorsing all the allegations brought by Băsescu. So, Ms Reding, you should apologise for the irresponsible language you used against a Member State and a democratic government calling a process that was constitutional and legal a parliamentary coup. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, this is the second time this year that we have had to address a very serious situation concerning the rule of law in one of the Member States of the European Union. After Hungary, Romania. And the debate today, like those we have had in the past on a similar question, was very much led by party political concerns, similar attitudes in similar debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and this is why we always need to act with fairness and impartiality. When there is an attack on the rule of law or a breach of EU legislation, irrespective of the political colour of the government, the Commission will remain firm in expressing concerns and taking actions, and this does not apply only now but has also applied in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I still remember a time when I took action on a very similar matter, which was in 2009 when I was Telecoms Commissioner. I started infringement proceedings against Romania to protect the independence of the national telecoms regulator. At that time a right-wing government coalition had introduced emergency legislation to deprive a court ruling of its effect and to remove the president of the national telecoms regulator from office.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the same rationale that the Commission followed earlier this year when we brought Hungary to the Court of Justice for violations of the independence of the Hungarian data protection legislation and other infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course such legal issues may seem small in the overall context. So what about the big picture? What about the rule of law in general and what about the independence of the judiciary?</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who asked these questions. Yes, the Commission has to play its role as guardian of the Treaties and it has to go after breaches in EU law by means of infringement proceedings. It is a general principle, and small violations count too. What about the big violations? Here I would to draw two lessons from the recent experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">First, of course, we always need to tackle these matters with independence and objectivity. Respect for the rule of law has nothing to do with the political party in power. For President Barroso and for myself, this has been very important throughout these processes. Lady Justice is blind. She does not recognise party political colours. She only reacts to the rule of law which is in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we can see very well by these very concrete examples that we have experienced this year that we lack effective mechanisms in the EU to enforce respect for the rule of law more generally and more systematically.</p>
<p class="contents">Today everybody mentions the situation in Hungary and Romania. Are we sure that we will not see such a situation again in a couple of weeks in another EU country? Now let us be honest – and some of the parliamentarians have said it very clearly – we face a Copenhagen dilemma. We are very strict on the Copenhagen criteria, notably on the rule of law in the accession process of a new Member State but, once this Member State has joined the European Union, we appear not to have any instrument to see whether the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary still command respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We as a European Union need to stand firm on our values and on the rule of law, and that is why I think that we need to put in place an objective mechanism to assess the judicial systems in all of our 27 Member States, because our infringement procedures are too technical and too slow to react to high-risk situations concerning the rule of law, and because the Article 7 procedure is a nuclear option that should only be used by the Commission, Parliament and the Council when there is really no other solution.</p>
<p class="contents">But what do we have in between? I would therefore like to work with the European Parliament and with the justice ministers of all Member States on a new intermediate and more focused mechanism. I propose to add to the economic and social benchmark in the European Semester a new mechanism for measuring, comparing and benchmarking the strength, efficiency and reliability of the justice systems in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So my experts are at this moment developing for the European Semester a justice scoreboard that will allow a detailed assessment of the justice systems of all Member States, their strengths and their weaknesses and I am going to start a discussion with Parliament and with the justice ministers in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans have built a Community based on the rule of law – <span class="italic">Rechtsgemeinschaft</span> as the Germans say – and we therefore cannot allow the rule of law to become an object of any party political game. We need a strong, reliable rule of law in all 27 Member States of the Union and I count on this Parliament to strongly support the European Commission in this endeavour.</p>

When a European Commissioner expresses opinions regarding the domestic politics of one of the Member States without checking the reliability of the information underlying his or her intervention, the EU as a whole is faced with a serious problem. I would like to draw Commissioner Reding’s attention to her information sources within the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL). Monica Macovei is untrustworthy when referring to the interference of the Government of Romania with the judicial system, given that the Superior Council of Magistracy has decided that she has exerted pressure on a Romanian prosecutor in charge of settling a criminal case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons why we, the Hungarians of Transylvania, consider the attention of the EU and Parliament to be important is that the post-communist Romanian Government broke a record in anti-Hungarian measures, launching a series of attacks against our minority institutions. Its series of hostile attacks began with its action against the Hungarian faculty at the Târgu Mureș University of Medicine and Pharmacy, in connection with which President Traian Băsescu rightly said that it is a fundamental right for a minority to have access to education in its native language at a university that is obliged to provide native language education for minorities. The series continued, among other acts, with an arbitrary attempt to re-nationalise the Székely Mikó Reformed College, which had been confiscated during communism and was later returned through restitution to its rightful owner, the Hungarian Reformed Church. Despite all this, we can ultimately conclude with satisfaction that ‘one way or the other, the Romanian institutions are resisting political pressure, and have managed to stay true to their mission as far as the Constitutional Court, the Chief Prosecutor’s Office and the Anticorruption Prosecution Office are concerned’ (Traian Băsescu). One of the reasons why the Ponta–Antonescu Government has launched a campaign of retribution against us is that the Hungarian community refused to support its unlawful and unconstitutional policy, namely the coup-like removal of President Traian Băsescu. In conclusion, I would like to ask Parliament and the Commission to continue to monitor the situation in Romania and the fate of the Hungarian minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost 30 000 people protested in Sfântu Gheorghe on 1 September against the abusive decision to renationalise the building of the ‘Székely Mikó’ Secondary School, which had been legally returned to the Reformed Church in Transylvania in 2002. This decision completely disregarded the principles of the rule of law and brought into question the guarantee of the property rights of Hungarian historical communities and churches. The only long-term solution to the institutional conflicts in Romania, which have reached their peak this summer, as well as to guaranteeing property rights is a real judiciary system reform and the long overdue constitutional reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title22"></a><a name="creitem22"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sharon Bowles, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, Commissioner, problems with the democratic legitimacy, accountability and timing of the various proposals on the banking union were foreseen. Unfortunately my concerns have now increased in other areas. This is important because there is a single-market cost benefit in making the European Central Bank the euro zone supervisor. I am concerned that this benefit is now more marginal. We will, of course, aim to rebalance that.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the Treaty provisions – which I must say now look extremely deficient in the area of financial services – I supported the ECB as euro zone supervisor in the interests of credibility. However, we should not pretend that this is a mutualisation that gives over the pockets of the ECB to backing euro zone banks. The only back-up is the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is in fact dubious and indirect now. After that, in terms of accountability, it is the pockets of the Member States that are relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposals themselves, Parliament must be fully involved in both pieces of legislation. There are ways that this can be done, and the moral pressure is enormous. We are turning the ECB into the banking supervisor at a time of crisis and a time when the ECB itself has moved centre stage in both economic and political events. Furthermore, given that the transfer of power to the ECB is not comfortable for many Member States – indeed maybe not for the majority of them – nor easy to balance in terms of single market procedures and accountability, it is all the more important that this directly elected House be seen to play a strong role beyond that of merely giving an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that you, Commissioner, and President Barroso have both spoken of this being treated as a package.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to accountability, Parliament’s role must stretch beyond occasional hearings in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I have conspicuously defended the independence of the ECB in monetary policy, but this must not inhibit due process on the supervisory side. We do not expect regulatory failure but, in such an event, an inquiry has to be possible. Without such inquiries we would not have found out about many aspects of the financial crisis and what went wrong. Waiving independence in this respect would help to demonstrate the separation of the supervisory side of the ECB from the monetary policy side.</p>
<p class="contents">On disciplinary matters, the procedure should, as far as possible, mirror the norms of national procedures. The ECB will, in effect, be prosecutor and judge, with the possibility of review by the European Court of Justice. If a banking licence is at stake then this review procedure is not fast enough. When it comes to procedures for hearings, the ECON Committee has more than once indicated dissatisfaction with the DG COMP hearing process and the lack of clarity in charges and evidence. I do not wish to see that as the model to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">More work needs to be done to protect the single market. A duty of care must be required from the ECB in relation to the single market, in the same way that it is required of the Commission. The interaction of the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA) needs adjustment to make sure that it is fair to all parties, and I know how difficult that will be. The ECB must adopt an outward-looking approach: for example, supervising all banks, including branches of third-country megabanks. That is a role for an international supervisor. There is, of course, also an issue of ensuring gender balance on the supervisory board. Having the Chair and Vice-Chair selected from the ECB’s men-only pool is not satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, supervisory policy is a matter for the single market and the EBA, not just the ECB. A single rulebook is no longer sufficient: we must have a single supervisory handbook, compiled using the expertise of supervisors from across the Union under the auspices of the EBA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank you sincerely, Madam President, for the opportunities that you have given me to listen to you, to reply to you and to listen to other MEPs who have opinions about this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">We want, with this banking union, to provide responses to the challenges that Europe and, in particular, the euro area, is currently facing. These, honourable Members, are challenges that you know well as you have been taking action and talking about them for a long time now.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the link between the situation of the banking sector and sovereign debt, a link that we want to break. The second concerns the temptation banks have to turn in on themselves, when in difficulties, and retreat to their national domain. It is therefore high time that we took action, and that is what we are doing today with these two legislative proposals, which are complementary and which should allow for the introduction of a single, efficient supervisory mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission presents a proposal for a regulation based on Article 127(6) of the Treaty to entrust the European Central Bank with specific missions in the area of prudential supervision. This is a simple system, it is credible and we believe that it is robust. It will enable the European Stability Mechanism to play its role if necessary, in accordance with the rules laid down in its decision-making procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a credible system because the European Central Bank will, ultimately, be responsible for taking key supervisory decisions, namely those which have an impact on or consequences for financial stability. Other supervisory decisions, for example, and your Assembly pays very close attention to these in the case of consumer protection, will remain clearly within the sphere of competence of national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">The single supervisor will thus be able to grant and withdraw licences from banks, check the risk management of a bank or even require it, within the framework of a European prudential regulation, to increase its funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is as simple as it is because we plan to make the European Central Bank responsible for the supervision of all the credit institutions in the euro area. These, ladies and gentlemen, are, quite simply, the lessons that we have drawn from the crisis. Systemic crises can be caused, as we have seen, by difficulties in medium-sized banks, sometimes even small banks, and not only by major international groups.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is also robust because, quite clearly, it is not a question of asking the European Central Bank to do everything by itself. We want to retain a role and responsibility within the joint supervisory framework for national supervisors who, as we are well aware, have resources, expertise and experience in each country. This single supervision will need these to plan its decisions, carry them out and implement and apply what I shall call the manual for single supervision for each of the banks, but do it at national level, once again, relying on a national supervisor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this system will be open, so to speak. We are proposing to those Member States that are not, or not yet, in the euro area to join the single supervisory mechanism voluntarily.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that some of you are concerned about the legal basis that we have chosen. These people rightly point out that this basis does not provide for a co-decision procedure, but rather the unanimity of the Council, even though Parliament played a crucial role, which I do not forget, in the introduction of supervisory authorities for markets, banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to be perfectly frank as I have always been with you, the choice that we made is the result of several objective considerations. Article 127(6) of the Treaty has the precise objective of entrusting supervisory tasks to the European Central Bank. That was therefore a logical and solid basis, and that is why the Heads of State or Government of the euro area explicitly requested the Commission to work on this basis in their declaration of 29 June. However, Parliament, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, will have its role to play. That I know and that is what I wish. I shall pay attention to any comments, proposals or criticisms that you make, because the two proposals that we are making today, for the regulation of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and for supervision, go together, as President Barroso said this morning to you and in your name.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the texts that we propose introduce a genuine system of accountability of the new and future supervisory Council vis-à-vis Parliament, which I think is a big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the second regulation that I have just mentioned will be targeted at adapting the functioning of the EBA to take account of the new balance arising from the single supervisory mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation is based on Article 114 of the Treaty, which provides for the ordinary legislative procedure. This proposal amends certain voting procedures within the EBA to enable to it continue to play a full role in developing common standards for the single market as a whole. This amendment is also targeted at enabling decisions to be taken and guaranteeing the single market as a whole, while protecting the rights and interests of each of its members.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are putting forward a document which provides the background to this single supervision project. We cannot put together integrated, efficient supervision without solid foundations, and these foundations, these bases for the 27 countries of the European Union – and that is why I do not want us to confuse the scope of the regulation, which is the same as that of all the other texts we have been putting together for the last two and a half years and that of the supervision – are the legislative proposals already on the table, and partly also adopted, and in some cases already implemented, concerning the future resolution of banking crises, the deposit guarantee system and the requirement for own resources through Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV).</p>
<p class="contents">These initiatives are key elements in what we together have called the ‘single rulebook’, for the internal market, which should indeed apply to all 27 Member States. The Commission does not therefore intend to withdraw either of these two proposals, which not only are compatible with banking union, but are also essential to its development and essential if we want to protect and consolidate the single rulebook, this common regulation for the European banking union as a whole. That is why I want Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and this is something we will discuss with the ministers tomorrow in Cyprus, to come to an agreement as soon as possible on these texts.</p>
<p class="contents">This clearly shows that strengthening the single market and single supervision are two complementary processes. Naturally, the introduction of this banking union will take us further on the way towards strengthening our dispute resolution and guarantee mechanisms, in accordance with the guidelines that have been clearly laid out in the report by the four Presidents and in the European Commission’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are all well aware that there is an urgent need to pull the euro area out of the crisis that it is in, and for the European Union, with its single market, to recover the growth that its citizens expect.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to draw attention to this urgent need, and that is why the Commission, since 29 June, has worked tirelessly, seriously and yet fast, to be able to put on the table in front of you and the governments these two proposals, which go together, to create an open, robust and credible supervisory system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rest assured, however, that I will examine your reply carefully, as I have someone here to listen to you.</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, I welcome the proposal. The proposal’s only flaw is that it is late and I therefore wish you the best of luck in developing it. However, the devil is in the detail and, as you know, in 2010 this Parliament requested many of these initiatives, but none of them has been adopted thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to meet two objectives. The first is to guarantee citizens’ deposits. The second objective is that, in the event of a bank failure, we end what has been happening to date, in that citizens have paid for this failure. This, however, is the vaguest area of the proposal tabled here. How should the orderly resolution of a failed bank be organised? What is the timetable for establishing the new authority that will manage this process? How will the prudential powers of the European Central Bank (ECB) then be transferred to the new entity?</p>
<p class="contents">This aspect of managing a bank failure without charging citizens is a key factor in the viability of this proposal. Finally, how do you ensure that the European Central Bank has some appeal mechanism, so that citizens or national supervisors may appeal against decisions by the European Central Bank, which currently has absolutely intrusive and greater powers, and will this probably have to be the way forward?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I end Mr President by asking how you ensure that there is no imbalance in the application of the relevant regulations between the practical supervision of the ECB and other countries and countries that are outside the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, in any event, aware of the fact that this is a complex subject, which should not be over-simplified and which should be examined in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see that you need to manage two contradictory aims. On the one hand, you have the unity of the internal market about which we care a great deal and on which, as you said, we worked two years ago. We have the right of oversight over an institution to which we have contributed. On the other hand, there is the perfectly legitimate right of the euro area to enhance its credibility in the sovereign debt crisis. I believe you also have tried to strike a balance. In the forthcoming discussions, we will see if it is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out two things. You have been brave enough to decide to place all banks under the responsibility of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is, I believe, the right approach in terms of competition. Furthermore, it allows you to make the point to the outside world that the supervision of the banks in the euro area is a European affair, and that is obviously an important point to make. It is also very important to emphasise that we are opening up to countries which are not yet members of the euro area, and to which, I believe, we should appear to be welcoming. Therefore, we shall of course deal with these issues as coherently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a small concern about the change to which this might give rise for the Central Bank. I am not saying that it should not be done. I believe that we must look at things carefully. The strength of the ECB today is its independence, the narrowness of its mandate and its federal structure. What we want is an institution which is more accountable to the elected representatives, with a much wider mandate and one that is part of a network. We must ensure that we retain all the qualities of the Central Bank, when we give it another function.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point, you will doubtless remember that, when we proposed a much more integrated supervision, we were very aware of those companies which act as a bank and an insurance company at the same time. We proposed bringing together the banking and insurance authorities in Frankfurt. Keep that in mind. The closer people are to each other and the more we work together, the better it will be for companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be very important to my colleague that work should progress quickly and reliably on this file in the coming weeks and months. All eyes are on us and the Council in this regard, waiting for us to overcome the crisis with the banks in Europe with a further step towards Europeanisation, namely a European banking union. It should be pointed out that Parliament demanded this with a broad majority two years ago. We held 26 trialogues. We made some progress in this direction, but unfortunately we did not get as far as we really needed to. This resulted in several billions more being added to the bill. It is good that the Council has now seen the writing on the wall and wishes to take things one step further for the good of the euro area. It is praiseworthy that the Commission has drawn up the proposals so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some difficulties with the Council’s proposal that the European Central Bank (ECB) should become the euro area watchdog, however. This results in unanimity in the Council, and means that Parliament is no longer involved in this matter in the codecision procedure. In the light of our experience with the supervisory package, this is not acceptable. That is why it is important that we should work quickly and that we should also negotiate this proposal regarding changes in the ECB as a package with the necessary changes in the existing supervisory regime, thereby securing the principle of the democratic involvement of Parliament on a de facto basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Other challenges also exist on a democratic level. The ECB is independent in terms of monetary policy, but not in terms of fiscal policy, for which it has had no responsibility until now. If it is now made responsible for bank supervision, Parliament needs full budgetary rights, control rights, questioning rights and appointment rights, and I am certain that Parliament will support this with a broad majority. We shall have to discuss the complex additional questions relating to the internal market, consumer protection and the balance between European power and financial responsibility in detail in the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, just like Mr Gauzès, I think the proposal we are talking about today first and foremost deserves a more general debate. It is also necessary to view the debate in the context of what we heard today from Mr Barroso, who told us that banking union is only part of the plan for deeper currency union, for the completion of fiscal union and for the completion of political union. These cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply do not agree that banking union is the miracle solution to all current economic problems. We believe that individual Member States must make serious structural reforms, and we see instead in the banking union proposal a postponement of these reforms, we see instead something that helps states to leapfrog them, something that transfers all debts to the supranational level and something that for a time, shall we say, should address at a supranational level the serious, profound and age-old problems which this proposal addresses only in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am saying this, and if what Mr Barroso said today holds true, then we must say that such a process has to be legitimised in a fundamentally democratic way. It cannot take place - and I apologise to the chamber - but it cannot take place only in these half-empty rows of seats. It must be the subject of serious and profound debate in the individual national parliaments. Citizens must be seriously informed about what is being planned, about what the consequences are for their states and for their pockets, what the benefits are and what the costs are. In my opinion, this is not possible without a fundamental and serious debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I also have another concern, which is an underlying concern: the EU controls monetary policy instruments, monetary policy is the EU’s responsibility, and banking supervision also becomes the EU’s responsibility. However, if everything goes wrong, if the banks fail, the responsibility for paying for this failure falls to the taxpayers of the Member States and it remains a national responsibility. This is not a minor problem; it is a fundamental problem that is not resolved. Finally, I would also like to mention another unresolved problem: the fact that we continue to tie monetary policy to inflation, which is a secondary issue in the current climate, and not to job creation and growth, as it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now faced with Article 12 of the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) without a ratification process, in other words, broken taboos are now to be followed by broken laws. We have heard that it is not only the ESM members, in other words the countries themselves, that are to receive financing, but also the banks directly. By breaking this taboo we have a situation whereby funds are to be paid out via the ESM and the supervision of the banks is to be handled by the bank that is increasingly becoming a bad bank because it is to buy up all the scrap loans of the bankrupt states of Europe. This system is doomed to failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the previous proposals in relation to bank supervision are in no way suitable for controlling the financial markets. If we really want to control the financial markets, this bank supervision by the ECB is wholly inadequate. The supervision of the financial markets that would be needed in order to take control in this area has failed mainly due to the resistance of the United Kingdom, which is unwilling to place its own financial economy under the control of the European Union. Thus, we find ourselves in an absolute dilemma. Nothing that is being done is sufficient. In the final analysis it will cost the taxpayer billions, taking us one step closer towards a union of the permanent debtors of the rest of Europe, a new USSR in other words. The countries with a healthy balance sheet are constantly required to pay for those countries that previously received low interest rates, despite the fact that they did not have the balance sheets to warrant these. This is a complete dead-end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a good thing because it is now clear that, following in the Council’s footsteps, the Commission has now reached the same conclusions as Parliament in 2010, namely that we need a banking union. Secondly, this is positive because the creation of a European surveillance mechanism offers the prospect of breaking the vicious circle between the banking problems and those of national debt, and thus the taxpayers. The third reason why this is to be welcomed is because concrete policy processes have now been put into motion. It is only with solid and conclusive decisions and with serious concrete steps forward that we will be able to regain the confidence of the people and the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now discuss this in detail. This is a proposal that demands a lot of attention because it is a very radical proposal. Later, we will definitely have the opportunity to return to this issue. But what I would now like to add is: in Parliament we have been concerned on at least one occasion about the democratic dimensions of this issue and– as you have already indicated – about its legal basis and the consequences of that basis on the involvement that Parliament can have in this important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we will not be choosing a different legal basis: we would need at least another six months, and that is a considerable loss of time, time that we cannot afford to lose. So, I am pleased that you have announced – as Mr Barroso said this morning – that we should debate these two proposals together. We trust that that will take place and that there is an agreement with the Council on that. It is the best guarantee of achieving high-quality surveillance, the kind of surveillance that is necessary to ensure that the banks again play the role that they have to play, and that is being at the service of the real economy and ensuring growth and jobs.</p>

You have quite rightly pointed out that the four pillars alongside supervision are of equal importance. Deposit guarantee schemes and crisis funds are two of these four pillars. This morning, Commission President Barroso stated that we could not have a situation where, in future, citizens would still have to pick up the tab for the mistakes of the banks. As you know, you have significant support in this House for the best possible financing of deposit guarantee schemes and crisis management. However, you know as well as I do that our common opponent is sitting in the Council. You know as well as I do that the deposit guarantee scheme that we adopted with a large, cross-party majority seven months ago with a worthwhile level of funding that would bring stability to the area has been given the green light by this House and sent forward for implementation. For the last seven months, the governments of the Member States have done nothing to meet us half way, nothing to ensure the future stability of the systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask at this juncture how you think we can rescue this situation. One thing is clear: Parliament will not allow plans to be drawn up for chronically underfunded guarantee schemes that are not worthy of the name. How can we work together to persuade the Council to keep its promises, so that our citizens are no longer asked to provide backing for banks that should be wound up or to pay out on deposits, but that the banks themselves should provide their own protections in future by contributing to corresponding funds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission now suggests establishing such supervision within the ECB and first focusing its work on the financial institutions of the euro area. The European internal market for financial service providers involves more than just the euro area, however. For this reason I believe it is crucial for us to act as quickly as possible to place not only the financial institutions of the euro area under this supervision, but also the entire European Union. The first step should be at least to place all the countries that have committed themselves to introducing the euro, in other words all countries except Denmark and the United Kingdom, under this supervision. It is important that this supervision should not become a bureaucratic monster. That is why it is crucial that the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the national supervisory bodies should be clarified quickly. It is also necessary to clarify the share-out of tasks between the ECB and the European Banking Authority (EBA).</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic legitimation has been mentioned more than once here. The key is that the accountability of this supervision is assured without putting the independence of the bank at risk. One more point: the project must be implemented in such a way that citizens have no reason to be even more Eurosceptic. Be careful in your use of national rescue, resolution and deposit guarantee funds. Our citizens see this as their money and want it to be used in their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I really cannot see how we could have gone any further than what you are proposing. I think you have scored 20 out of 20 here. You are trying to supervise all the banks in Europe, and not only some of them. You are aiming for simplicity and I think that we can only welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">Where you have perhaps shown a little less ambition, is when you said, ‘We accepted the legal basis that the Council recommended to us.’ I would nonetheless like to remind you that it is you, and you alone, who have the right of initiative, and therefore you were perfectly at liberty to choose another procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, obviously I understand the choice of the European Central Bank, but I think that it causes us two problems. It causes us the problem of the concentration of power. I do not think that it is healthy, in a democratic system, for one institution in particular to accumulate too much power. However, here, in the context of crisis management and monetary policy, we are witnessing a kind of mission creep at the Central Bank, a change in its mandate, the temptation, in brief, to extend its powers, and here, we are going to increase them even further. I think that we should pay attention to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: we are dealing with an institution whose traditions do not include democratic accountability, in other words one in which independence is a deeply rooted family tradition. I find it hard to see how those very people who pride themselves on their total independence when they come before us as a monetary authority can then show the requisite deference to the democratic institutions when they act as supervisors. I think that we would need a great deal of imagination to introduce provisions and rules to ensure that there are no abuses of power or lack of democratic accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is clear that, by subjecting all European banks to European supervision, you are breaking not only the unhealthy link between public debt and private debts, but you are also perhaps breaking another link, that is the rather excessive complicity between the supervised and the supervisors at national level. That incestuous behaviour should cease and you will contribute to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How are the non-euro zone Member States’ banks going to interact within euro zone countries? How will cross-border and third country relationships in the financial services be treated? How will the single market and the single rule book for the 27 be preserved and how is the EBA (the European Banking Authority) going to function with 17 Members represented by a single body balanced against the other ten? Solving the constitutional quandary will not be easy, and in doing so I hope that the Commissioner will be able to answer all of these questions to the satisfaction of this House and all 27 governments.

I believe that is necessary. I have a couple of questions, however. The European landscape, the EU, is dotted with a wide variety of banks: savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks, big banks. I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And that is the very thing that is crucial for growth and jobs. I wish to compliment Commissioner Barnier on the proposals he has tabled today. The direction he has taken is good because it means giving intervention powers to the ECB. However, we have to see how well this will be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to focus on certain considerations. We must not distort the internal market, but strengthen it. That means a strong role for the EBA as guardian of the simple European ‘rulebook’. But, how will this work in the future? Will it be revoked by the ECB with additional capital or liquidity requirements? What is the connection between the two? In addition, we need to expand banking supervision as soon as possible to as many banks as possible in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies my second point of concern. Because, despite what you said, a wall is likely to be erected between banks in the countries within the euro area and those outside it. There, too, there are banks that have been infected by the crisis virus and there, too, there are many countries, such as Poland, Hungary and others that would like to join. We need to deal with that seriously because, ultimately, we want stability throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries have already tried to take the edge off the proposals. But, we need to <span class="italic">strengthen</span> those proposals and, to do that, we need Parliament! This was the case when it came to the establishment of the European supervisory authorities. This was the case when it came to decision making for the six-pack for economic governance. We must also strengthen our co-legislative role for proposals for which we have advisory powers. We have proved that with the six-pack, too.</p>

In the UK, the socialist government gave away that power and it was a very expensive mistake. Therefore, the euro zone central bank supervision of euro zone banks makes some sense for the euro zone but not for those of us who are outside the euro zone. Also you cannot have strong supervision without strong rules. In our backroom negotiations on banking rules we are going round and round in circles. Sometimes a single rulebook is far from a single market and it feels as if, within that market, each market stallholder is setting their own standards. Sometimes those are far from the global minimum standards. In the cross-border world of banking that exposes us all to risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK supported the EBA to be a police enforcer to pull up standards across the single market. We must not confuse the role of the ECB as supervisor with that of the EBA as single market enforcer. Votes matter. If the ECB was to block-vote against the non-euro zone Member States and that was perceived as trying to drop standards within Europe, then that would undermine the euro zone even further. So the votes will matter.</p>

We are all well aware of that, but nobody dares say it!</p>

This gives me the opportunity to observe that the Commission is unable, yet again, to see beyond the end of its nose and to see that interest rates, lending and mortgages are being used to manipulate both companies and consumer mortgages and Member States. In this particular instance, in both Greece and elsewhere, this is being done by mortgaging public property and undermining any potential for growth. The Commission has opted to overlook certain things and to play the role of ‘Pontius Pilate’, by establishing different tactics for recapitalising the banks from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank refuses to accept that its bonds should receive a haircut. I understand that this is a step, a communication policy for more Europe. However, we have asked you and you have not told us what will happen to the states’ sovereign rights, what will happen on the question of democracy, what will happen with labour rights, what will happen to workers’ rights and to the future of the young generation.

This project failed because of the Member States, and the Commission accepted the result. If things have changed, then I am unreservedly in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">However, serious concerns exist in relation to the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the legal basis; they also relate to the fact that all 6 000 banks in the euro area are now to be controlled by a European super-authority in the shape of the ECB. This proposal runs counter to the principle of subsidiarity, disempowers the national supervisory authorities and emasculates the European Banking Authority (EBA). New rules have been introduced that favour the non-euro area members of the EBA. In other words, this entire system will not lead to the implementation of uniform regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Council will not accept this proposal in this form. This is why Parliament has the right to insist on a different legal basis and thus, in particular, to make the EBA the cornerstone, rather than the European Central Bank. The establishment of uniform regulations for all locations and all authorities and banks is the right approach. Greater, risk-based distribution of supervision is also right. Last week, Mr Draghi said he was considering a matrix in the distribution of functions involving the balance sheet total, international business and risk weighting. I see no evidence of this in the proposal. The Commissioner has once again identified regional banks like Bankia, which has a balance sheet of EUR 310 billion, or Dexia with EUR 560 billion, or Northern Rock with EUR 150 billion, as small banks. This has been established within national competences, under EU competition law, not with excessive bank supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not my main point, however. I am also in favour of the fund, of restructuring, of the EUR 150 billion fund that Mr Van Rompuy is to propose. I am opposed to a uniform deposit guarantee scheme throughout Europe. After all, this would mean that first taxpayers, and then savers, would have to pay for the banking crisis. Parliament, or at least part of it, will resist this very strongly.</p>

The proposal for a single banking supervisory mechanism, and in the longer term the setting up of a banking union has motivated my delegation to address a question to the European Commission. We are concerned primarily with the issue of the terms on which countries outside the eurozone would participate in the supervisory mechanism, countries such as Poland, whose government has already – probably too easily - indicated a willingness to surrender a part of its sovereignty. We await a detailed reply from the Commission regarding the functioning of this forced mechanism and its decision making process, which includes so-called voluntary members from outside the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is simple: how important will these countries be? Will they have a right to vote and what will they be able to influence? I am afraid that if there is further integration of banking in the eurozone, the impact will be felt also by financial institutions outside the eurozone, since capital is extensively and closely connected in the current global situation. We therefore call for a very detailed and careful approach in reaching a decision on this matter, and for the importance of those countries that form part of the European Union, but do not currently form part of the eurozone, to be taken into account also.</p>

It makes the decisions reached at the June summit more credible because it provides more concrete information. We must now turn to the legislation. A common currency needs a common supervisory authority for all banks, a common budget and a common tax policy, a common banking, fiscal, economic and social union, as well as a political union as an objective. The banking union is a tiny element along the way in learning lessons from the crisis and providing answers to the common currency. We might say, why not act immediately? We called for this two years ago, but were blocked by the Council until the autumn of last year. Let us not start blocking the proposals in every detail once again instead of setting to work implementing them and realising the goals. No more blocking tactics!</p>
<p class="contents">Banking union is also linked with the CAT4 and Basel III tasks. Please help us to establish compatibility between the banking union and these proposals during this work. We need clarity between independent currency policy and the supervisory functions, between the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank and between the current financial market regulations and the projects for the future. We have much to do. Let us not block our own work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the crucial decision that the European Council has taken and which involves conferring new powers on the European Central Bank, an institution which, in addition to being completely federal and integrated, has also shown its expertise since the beginning of the crisis of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is essential for this decision not to be questioned in the forthcoming legislative process. I am not calling for a model where supervision would no longer be in the hands of national and local authorities at all. To the contrary, the distribution of powers must be objective and gradual so that we can reconcile an overview with supervision of what is happening on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be careful not to make public institutions, whether national or European, compete with each other. I understand that the European Banking Association (EBA) retains duties which are not insignificant, but it is clear, to my mind, that, of the two, it is the European Central Bank that is set to play a crucial role. The work that is starting now should not serve to reopen discussions which have been settled. The more complex and fragmented the supervisory architecture is in France, the less robust the European banking landscape will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not confer any rights, yet it immediately imposes obligations on the entrant without offering any protection. If a country does not join, it might be that it will not receive any information, meaning that it could be left out of everything. However, regardless of whether a country joins or not, if it is a non-euro-area country it will not have access to the ESM, meaning, Commissioner, that it can rely on its own strength alone.

However, granting greater powers to the European Central Bank could lead to imbalances between the banks in the euro area and those outside it. At the same time, there are still some concerns regarding a possible competition starting between large and local banks. Therefore, I believe an appropriate balance must be struck in order to be able to reduce the vulnerability facing this sector.</p>

<p class="contents">I would sincerely like to thank you for the wide range of points of view you have expressed, for the constructive and critical approach, which I welcome, that you have adopted towards these two regulations proposed by the Commission. What has cost taxpayers money, as I mentioned to some of you, is the fact that certain banks had been poorly supervised. What we propose is for banks, whatever their size, in the euro area and in any country that so wishes, for this is an open process, to be supervised in a serious, integrated and effective manner, precisely to protect consumers, companies and citizens. We shall go further, Mr Klute, on the question of consumer protection, over the next few months. The proposals that we have made are balanced. Many of you, Ms Bowles first of all, have mentioned the single market. I would like to point out that we must not confuse regulation with supervision. Regulation falls within the powers of the 27 countries and the single market, which I support, as do you, and for which we are responsible. We shall continue to create the different elements of this package with supervision for 27, with capitalisation for the 27 countries and 8 000 banks, with credit and deposit guarantee schemes and with dispute resolution systems. The 27 countries need this regulation, as well as the other two parts of the package that we will propose on the parallel banking system and the separation of risks in banks, following the Liikanen report. This regulation will belong to the 27 and to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here, because there is the euro on one hand and an additional need for stability on the other, is that within the euro area the personality and nature of the supervision will be different. It will be more integrated. Mr Langen, we shall take account of the role and position of national regulators. We are not going to do that from Frankfurt, on a daily basis, for all 6 000 banks. There will be work to be done in a coordinated framework, and it will be broadly decentralised at the level of all the banks. In our proposal I, as indeed all of us are, am extremely concerned about the ways in which those countries either not yet or not in the euro area could be associated to this regulatory system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you all already know, I, like President Barroso, am committed to Parliament. We were careful to plan for parliamentary control systems for this supervisory mechanism and I shall act as guarantor of the proper exercise of this parliamentary control in the introduction of this new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the stability of the euro area, because that is what is at issue, is not of concern only to the countries of the euro area. It concerns the whole of Europe. When the euro area is fragile, when it is in crisis, Europe as a whole suffers the consequences. We must give ourselves the means to guarantee the stability of this area. This is not the only response, but it is a fundamental and far-reaching element, I admit, in terms of integration in the euro area to guarantee the stability of this area and, beyond that, the stability of the entire single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was challenged in the WTO and we had a WTO waiver until 2007 which allowed us to continue to give those one-sided preferences. That should have expired if all EPAs (Economic Partnership Agreements) had been signed, but they had not so we had then to pass the Market Access Regulation 1528/2007 to provide a bridging solution and this has since allowed duty-free and quota-free access for the 36 ACP countries that have initialled EPAs but not yet signed or ratified them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission now believes that this temporary solution should come to an end and their proposal is to remove this preferential access on 1 January 2014. In my view, Mr President, the Commission is half correct. It is true that the regulation was a temporary solution and it is therefore reasonable that an end date should be set. It is also fair to the other developing countries outside the ACP who see countries at a similar economic level to them getting benefits that they are denied.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we have to see this proposal in the context of the current climate of economic partnership agreement negotiations. We must not create the perception, fair or otherwise, that we are bullying African countries into signing and ratifying EPAs without giving them enough time for careful consideration. That is why the Trade Committee has put forward the deadline of 1 January 2016 which gives due notice to the ACP countries that their preferences must come to an end but also, in my view, gives a realistic timescale to complete negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now some colleagues have said to me in the course of the debate that this is yet another extension of the deadline. Colleagues, it is not, because we have never had a deadline until now, so this is the first proposal for a deadline and if passed it is important to understand that it will be set in stone, because no change to this deadline could take place without a further Commission proposal and without the agreement of both Parliament and Council; and I suggest that it is unlikely that the Commission would bring forward another proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the 2014 deadline would give momentum to the EPA negotiations. I have to say, having spoken to colleagues in many of the countries that are affected, I believe the opposite to be the truth. Most of them regard 2014 as an unreasonable target. If we were to vote for 2014 we are, in my opinion, excluding 17 countries from the scheme. They would simply not be able to meet that 2014 deadline, whereas 2016 sets a firm but achievable target.</p>
<p class="contents">So for organisational reasons, for political reasons and for reasons of economics, I think 2016 is a workable and achievable deadline, and I hope even at this stage we can persuade the Commission that this is a good target to set. They get their objective of a firm end date to the preferences but we also give our partners a reasonable negotiating timetable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What you are not being told is the following. Up until the end of the 1990s, the EU was granting African, Caribbean and Pacific countries special unilateral tariff preferences that were more generous than the Generalised System of Preferences. Other trade partners attacked us over this in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Under WTO rules, special preferences cannot discriminate between countries in a similar economic situation except by waiver, which we were granted for the last time between 2000 and 2007. In the mean time we were expected to bring our trade relationship into line with WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000 the EU and ACP countries signed the Cotonou Agreement wherein they agreed without coercion to modernise their trade and aid relations. Let us not forget that until then, even these very generous preferences were not enough to improve ACP exports to Europe. Indeed, between 1967 and 1999 the ACP’s share in total EU imports fell from 7.7 % to 2.8 %, so we agreed in Cotonou – specifically in Article 16 of the Treaty – to conclude new bilateral trade agreements that would be WTO-compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a proposal that made economic sense because of the poor experience with unilateral tariff preferences. But it was also one that matched the political moods at the time. The international community at large had finally understood that development policies which do not sustain good governance are simply not sustainable. EU trade policy had to reflect this too. I have said this before and I will say it again: the political value of bilateral trade agreements is that they create flanking policies and institutions to manage the implementation of commercial commitments. Besides stimulating the two-way flow of trade, lowering customs tariffs reduces the potential for poor governance, in particular corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me try once again to explain what this regulation is about. In 2007, by the time we had conducted and concluded EPA negotiations with about half of the ACP countries, the EU, acting in good faith, passed the Market Access Regulation to allow our EPA partners continued market access to the EU on a duty-free, quota-free basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We did so on the understanding that our EPA partners would formalise their commitment to these agreements within a year or two by signing and ratifying them. Most EPA partners proved us right and did take the necessary steps. Eighteen had not until last year. But a few months later Zimbabwe ratified its interim EPA. Nine of the countries left are least developed countries and will continue to enjoy duty-free, quota-free status because they continue to be eligible for ‘everything but arms’ benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves us with only eight countries actually affected by the proposal we are discussing today. To be even clearer, we are talking about Botswana, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Fiji, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia and Swaziland, which makes me wonder why these particular eight countries need more time to adjust to a situation that was already required 12 years ago, when 87 countries and territories are adjusting to our 2011 GSP proposal in less than three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The broader picture on EPAs is really something to be proud of. We are continuing negotiations for comprehensive EPAs with practically all the EPA regions and I have a small set of outstanding issues left with the East African Community, with Western Africa and with EPA partners in the Southern Africa Development Community, the SADC. Furthermore we are implementing agreements concluded back in 2007 with the Caribbean, Papua New Guinea and four Eastern and Southern African countries. Some of them are also continuing negotiations to get to comprehensive regional agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">What this agreement is about is the past: EPAs initialled by the end of 2007. So it is not about negotiations on comprehensive EPAs, the argument invoked by some to justify an extended deadline. This is an agreement about doing away with the past, it is not about the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is such heavy resistance today from those who would prefer to extend the status quo, I cannot help but ask a question. Are we not letting down a promising entrepreneurial class in eight ACP countries if the 2014 deadline is extended? Why should a Kenyan, an Ivorian or a Namibian business person who has an innovative idea, finds a niche market and wishes to develop a product with the assistance of good European machinery, continue to have to pay very heavy import duties for the next two, four or even seven years? How can that business idea grow if inputs are expensive? How many new jobs could be created if tariff barriers were removed? Why do we continue to see Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific as not being capable of exporting much more than basic agricultural commodities? That is so far from present-day realities and needs. Sometimes wanting to do good is actually the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as Trade Commissioner-designate, I took a pledge before this Parliament in February 2010 to uphold and further strengthen the multilateral trading system. At the time I also understand my ambition is to bring EPA negotiations to a successful conclusion provided the results are WTO-compatible and can foster development.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Commissioner I am also bound by EU law. For these reasons, as well as my conviction that free trade deals serve poor countries better, I continue to support the Commission proposal to amend the Market Access Regulation with legal effect on 1 January 2014 and I very much hope that this wisdom will also convince Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is because our old trade agreement with the ACP countries, that is to say the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, was declared illegal. It discriminated against other poor countries. We therefore decided to opt for the approach we are now taking of negotiating economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries. It has taken a long time – an unacceptably long time. It is in all of our interests for these agreements to be in place as soon as possible, as it is only once we have these agreements that we will be able to achieve any real development in poor countries, along with investments and better governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The only reason we have had these temporary trade preferences is to bridge the gap between our old, illegal agreements and these new economic partnership agreements. They were just temporary, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire debate here today is actually about how long we mean by ‘temporary’. Those on the left in this House say that temporary means forever, or at least until 2019. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament say that temporary is probably up to 2016. I get the feeling that temporary means anytime except right now. It has now been more than 12 years, however – and that is more than just temporary. Why is that? It is because the temporary customs facilities are essentially unfair – they are unfair to other poor countries that do not belong to Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They are unfair in particular to those ACP countries that respected the fact that they were temporary and negotiated and entered into partnership agreements with us. We therefore have a responsibility to set an ultimate limit for this temporary scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us continue to be honest and admit that we will never have any economic partnership agreements if we say that the temporary scheme is to last forever. What should we say to the other poor countries, to those countries that at one time accused us of not caring about fairness or about World Trade Organisation regulations? Therefore, we must support this proposal and bring this temporary scheme to an end. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) therefore believe that the Commission’s proposal should be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it would be good if we could try to agree to conduct a first reading of this in order to get the rules in place as soon as possible. I therefore think the best thing to do would be to vote on all of the amendments and then postpone the final vote so that we can initiate negotiations with the Council. After all, it is only a date that separates us, a date that is very significant, but it is something on which I believe we could reach an agreement. I would therefore call on both the President and the rapporteur to consider whether we should initiate negotiations with the Council and try to achieve a first reading agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities.

Sometimes this requires a bit more time.</p>

We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round.</p>
<p class="contents">These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information.</p>
<p class="contents">As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly.

This runs completely contrary to the EU’s objective of reducing poverty and organising all external political instruments in line with this principle. Countries like Cameroon, Ivory Cost and Namibia would be very hard hit by this restriction. Regional integration projects, such as those in South East Africa, would collapse if Kenya were to consent to such an agreement. South-south cooperation would be at an end.

While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy.

The main question is: should the EU withdraw unilateral trade preferences, which the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries temporarily enjoy, from those countries in the group that do not negotiate and ratify economic partnership agreements with the European Union in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement? The follow-up question is: how long should we give the countries concerned to negotiate and conclude the agreements in question since, unfortunately, the 2007 regulation contained no deadline?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the first question can only be a definite yes. Firstly, the 2007 regulation was clearly temporary; secondly, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) waiver expired in 2007, and therefore the trade preferences in question are illegal and violate the EU’s obligations to the WTO; thirdly, maintaining these unilateral trade preferences would be unfair, both to non-ACP least developed countries, which do not enjoy the same preferential treatment, and to those ACP countries that have concluded economic partnership agreements with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the time period, the Committee on International Trade was not convinced by the Commission and decided to extend the deadline proposed by the Commission by two years, from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2016. In principle it is a more balanced and reasonable solution. In contrast, proposals to extend this period even further no longer deserve support, as they prolong the current illegal and unfair situation excessively. In brief, this Parliament should fully approve Mr Martin’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is called blackmail. According to the NGO Comhlamh the loss of DFQF market access could effectively close the European market for some sectors and will be disastrous for the economies of the countries concerned. For Namibia, for example, the duties levied on beef exports alone would amount to almost EUR 60 million, around 30 % of their exports.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the position of the rapporteur when he suggests that the main reason behind the Commission’s proposal is to increase pressure on these states to sign up to economic partnership agreements. Opposition to EPAs is growing in the region among trade unions, civil society organisations and now the Commission has responded by attempting to bully these countries into responding to these agreements which are not in the interests of working people and small farmers in their country. But that is why I do not share the rapporteur’s opinion that we should simply give them more time. The Commission’s proposal must be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EPA must effectively address some of the most fundamental challenges many ACP countries are facing, for example regional integration, and Europe is well placed to know that that integration takes time.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Africa, I am particularly concerned that a satisfactory agreement for all is found on the SADC EPA.

<p class="contents">I therefore fully support David Martin’s recommendation for a 2016 deadline as I believe this is a fair compromise for all parties, especially in this year which will be a litmus test for relations between the EU and its African and Pacific partners as we are also reviewing the Cotonou Agreement, the European Development Fund and the Development Cooperation Instrument.

My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts therefore lead me to believe that our rapporteur’s proposal is the best possible compromise if we want to give the Commission services and the ACP countries the time they need to conclude their EPA negotiations.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I could give you one minute of my speaking time, for example, provided of course that you are not going to interrupt me afterwards!</p>
<p class="contents">I understand a number of the remarks that have been made but I would urge you to stay with the facts as they are. What this is really about is that a number of countries have not yet signed and/or ratified an agreement they concluded in 2007. That is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is about the past. The idea that we want to force them to conclude and ratify a definite and final economic partnership agreement is not correct. I have mentioned the eight countries – a limited number of countries – that could be affected in one way or another by what we are proposing. I will read them out again: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Fiji, Ghana, Kenya and Swaziland – which are lower middle-income countries – and Botswana and Namibia, which are higher middle-income countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not, in any way you could imagine, affect a developing country. In the developing countries you have two separate categories: the least developed countries (LDCs) who benefit from Everything But Arms – and that continues – and the other ones that benefit from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) or the GSP+. So it is not about those countries. What it is really about is countries – albeit a limited number of countries, but in a much bigger category if you look at it worldwide – where, if we do not put an end to the market access regulation in the form it exists, which is always considered to be temporary, unilateral access to the European markets would be created, with those countries exporting duty-free and quota-free products other than arms. That is what you would create.</p>
<p class="contents">So in fact you would create inequality between the eight that I have mentioned and – I do not know how many but I would estimate – 50 or 60 worldwide that are in a different position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are we forcing anybody to do this? No. We are not. If they do not want to ratify the agreement that they themselves concluded in 2007, then they do not do have to do so. Even then, our door is open to negotiating a new agreement with them. But I cannot see how we would be unfair or bullying or blackmailing (and a lot of similar words have been used here) in asking somebody who concluded an agreement in 2007 – that means five years ago, with a further three or four years of negotiations, and especially given that they should have adapted their system already – to now ratify what they signed, initialled and promised to ratify. Do it!</p>
<p class="contents">They have already had five to seven years, depending on the starting point, and we are giving them an additional year-and-a-half just to ratify, not to negotiate a new agreement but to ratify. Is this unfair? Is this blackmailing? Is this jeopardising our position with respect to Africa? Really, I do not believe so.</p>
<p class="contents">Bernd Lange spoke of a confrontation between a strong Commission and weak states. That is what I heard you say. First of all, thank you for calling us strong: that is not bad. Some of these states are weak but I did not mention the weakest, the ones that are in debt, the LDCs and the developing countries. We are talking here about lower and middle income countries. That is what we are talking about. The question is not whether they are weak or strong. The only thing we ask of them is to ratify what they negotiated and concluded in the past. We are not bullying them about anything other than living up to the commitments that they made quite some time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a remark to Mr Keller, who said the policy would be contrary to my statement, which is also in the communication, that trade can promote development. That is not true because you can currently see, with the existing schemes, that the trade volume is going down drastically. Why so? Because trade is about more than just exporting something to another market. It is a means engaging with that market and having trade movements in both directions. It is about aid for trade and about establishing a vibrant marketplace that can export products to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warmly welcome their doing that to a much greater extent than they have done in the past. Personally I am very sad about the fact that the trade volume with Africa is going down. It should be going up. I am ready to be very flexible in the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) that we still have to negotiate with a number of regional entities. I have no problem at all with asymmetry. I hope the countries concerned can export much more to the European Union. We are ready to help them with aid for trade. We are ready to help them with trade facilitation – my colleague, Andris Piebalgs is in complete agreement with me about that – but they should live up to their commitments so that we can proceed and establish a sure legal system, legal obligations and legal rights in a negotiated framework. That is what we are asking for and that is also why I stand by the proposal that we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">I really hope that tomorrow when you vote you take this into account. This proposal is not against developing countries and it is not against Africa. On the contrary, it is for the good of having mature trade relations with countries that should develop and should take off. Most of the countries that have not yet taken off are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that is no accident. We should do something about this. It is our moral duty to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Take Kenya: if it was looking after its own economic interests, Kenya would ratify an EPA, but if Kenya ratified an EPA unilaterally it would break its relationship with the East Africans. And we put them in this position where either they break the relationship with East Africa or they suffer economic costs. Their cut flower industry is vital to them; that industry will face massive tariffs if they do not sign up for an EPA and we pass this regulation. At the same time this Commission and probably this Parliament are going to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement which is going to give trade preferences on cut flowers to their biggest rival, Colombia. So it is a double whammy against Kenya. We are not asking them to give them protection in perpetuity but we are at least saying give them two or three years in order to find a solution that encompasses both their objective of signing an EPA and staying within their East African regional partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not got time to go into the others but South Africa is the same; Botswana and Namibia have the same pressure in terms of their relationship with South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my view is simple. You want 2014 because you think this gives momentum to the negotiations. I do not want 2014 because I think it does exactly the opposite. Firstly it will sour the mood in terms of our relationship with the ACP countries and secondly I think it is an impossible deadline to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">So all we are saying as a House to you is, let us not rush this, let us set a deadline. And I will repeat what I said at the beginning: that deadline would be set in concrete. It is not a flexible deadline; it is not one that is moveable once we pass the legislation. 2016 is not unreasonable; it gives African countries time to come into line and at the same time makes us, I hope, look a bit more reasonable and a bit less impatient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the gas sector, import dependence on third countries has already exceeded 60% with a clear upward trend; in the oil sector, it is already over 80%. Of course, it is very important for us – for Europe – to ensure secure and stable energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">How is that being done today? At present, each European Union Member State concludes a bilateral agreement with a third-country supplier for these energy supplies. Unfortunately, these agreements are completely non-transparent. No one except the specific Member State really knows what provisions these agreements contain. There is also the possibility, of course, that European legislation is not being fully observed; in particular, it is possible that fixed energy-supply networks in the gas sector are impenetrable to competition. What does this mean for us? It means that European consumers may be suffering from this situation. Where there is no competition, the price will unfortunately be higher; there is also a lack of Europe-wide coordination, and therefore even a kind of ‘divide and rule’ policy is possible on the part of suppliers. Each Member State fends as it can, alone.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the proposed solution? In February 2011, the Council in its Council conclusions instructed – requested – the Commission to come forward with legislation, with a solution that could improve this situation. The Commission has done so, and that is the legislation that we are specifically discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the basic proposal for simplifying everything? There is a proposal to create a single information-exchange mechanism in which all Member States would provide the Commission with information on bilateral agreements. Not only would the Commission then be able to assess whether such agreements comply with European legislation and whether competition in terms of infrastructure is ensured, but a possibility for coordination would also arise, allowing Europe to start speaking with one voice in negotiations with these third-country energy suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">So far in the committee, when we started assessing this draft legislation, we were strongly in agreement that the Commission’s proposed legislation should not only be supported, but even made stricter, assigning an even greater role to the Commission. More than 90% of the committee supported the final text – with this large mandate I headed for trilateral talks with the Council, in the so-called trialogue, and there, as all shadow rapporteurs who were also present know, we virtually ran into a wall. In essence, the Council, without saying so directly, did not want this legislation – in spite of the fact that by working with the Danish Presidency in three trialogues, in three rounds, we reached a compromise solution that would be acceptable to both Parliament and the Council, so that we could adopt this legislation at all.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is this solution? The solution is for the Commission to find the possibility of establishing the aforementioned information-exchange mechanism; for the Member States to submit to the Commission all existing and also future agreements for assessment; for a possibility to be created for determining whether the legislation is being observed; and for the unified information base that would help the European countries in negotiations with third-country suppliers to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">What is not included is a right for the Commission itself to get involved even before the signing of an agreement in order to eliminate problems in the initial version. The Council simply did not accept that. However, I urge you to support this compromise; by supporting this legislation, we shall be taking a step towards a unified European energy policy and toward securing the interests of our consumers.</p>

I can only concur with Mr Kariņš and his account of the entire process. I can only thank him for his committed, diplomatically adroit presentation on behalf of Parliament, which has produced a successful result.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? On the one hand, it is about the fact that we have intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third states that we know are not based 100% on European law, in other words that are not compatible with European law. We do not believe that these agreements were concluded by the Member States because they sought to anger the European Union, but rather because they were pressurised into these agreements by the supplier countries. That is why disclosure is the right way to determine whether agreements between Member States and third countries are based on European law and internal market law – and to change these if this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of competitive advantages and disadvantages. The playing field is not level when suppliers and the states in which they are established are aware of all agreements, but the Member States only know about their own. Transparency rules can provide a remedy here.</p>
<p class="contents">The next matter is the investors. These are generally interested in private investments for networks, for example for gas pipelines. These infrastructural projects require a certain degree of legal clarity. However, if the intergovernmental agreements are not known, the result is uncertainty. Greater transparency in terms of the compatibility of the agreement with European law means that we can prevent nasty surprises, avoid infringement proceedings, establish legal certainty and therefore establish investment incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise now achieved lags somewhat behind what we proposed and what Parliament wanted. This is an important first step, however. Historically speaking, this is the first time that we have a certain European external energy policy. It will no longer be as easy for third parties to play the ‘divide and conquer’ game. All elements in the current proposal, namely the commitment to disclose existing intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) that impact on the internal market, the confirmation that the Commission can demand to be allowed to participate in negotiations as an observer and to act in an advisory capacity, and the option of being able, on request, to test in advance the compatibility of negotiated agreements with EU law – all of this establishes clarity sooner, strengthens the European internal market and reinforces the position of the Member States in relation to supplier countries, in other words third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we are now going to implement in the legislation. Again I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation in Parliament. We shall also examine how this works in practice. The precise monitoring and compliance of our new laws will need to be managed in the coming years. The Commission will see whether we have sufficient instruments for this purpose. If not, we shall present a proposal in a few years for how the issue of external energy policy is to be developed. This is the right and important first step, but no doubt further action will be required. I would like to thank you for your cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today I am speaking as the representative and rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs. We must not forget that the European Union is still heavily dependent on energy imports, making the functioning of and the energy supply on the energy market insecure in numerous cases. This new mechanism may indeed substantially strengthen the Member States’ negotiation power via the single European market and the Commission’s expertise in Community law. At the same time, the legal certainty that will apply to future investment decisions via a stable legal framework will make it easier for the Union to finance such works and may, in numerous cases, speed up implementation times. Clearly, the improved coordination that can be achieved via this mechanism should not be interpreted as a loss of flexibility in the Member States. The entire endeavour will be of an auxiliary nature and should not replace the Member States as the competent bodies for entering into energy agreements with third countries. However, the Commission’s involvement may generate exponential benefits by providing essential assistance to the Member States, especially during the negotiation stage of such agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would say that thanks to that effort and determination, we now have a mechanism that, for the first time, allows information and communication to be exchanged between Member States and the Commission regarding intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy that are reached in those Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the idea is to have constant knowledge of the supply map or the energy supply networks and it is very positive, therefore, for the improved management of energy supply in the European Union.</p>

I would also like to thank you, Mr Oettinger, for your proposal. In general, you are doing your work really well in the area of energy policy. The object of my criticism, in other words the Council, is not here at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have participated in around 50 conciliation procedures and trialogues, involving negotiations with the Council. However, in all this time, I have never witnessed anything like this before, namely that the Council has taken a heavy-handed position, seeking to blackmail Parliament by saying: take it or leave it. I have never known the Council’s chief negotiator to get up and leave a trialogue before.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we have a contradiction to what we are constantly being told in the sermons from on high: we need more involvement from Europe. This morning we have once again discussed the fact that what we need in this crisis situation is more involvement from Europe and an agreement in relation to our core policies. Mr Oettinger, you have hit the nail on the head. Energy policy is central to the European Union, to economic growth and to a forward-looking energy policy. It is only logical, ladies and gentlemen, that we can only have a sound energy policy if we can also agree on a common external energy policy, in other words agreements with third countries. Accordingly, while I understand and sympathise with the idea that achieving the lowest standard is better than nothing, we must press for greater commitment in this legislative proposal. We want to make it mandatory for the Commission to be informed and we want the Commission to participate in negotiations. That is the least we need in order to ensure that a European external energy policy really is put into practice and that the Member States do not drag their feet as usual. We shall table these amendments tomorrow and hope that you will support them so that we can give the Council something more to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am naturally hopeful that you are really serious about your last point, namely that there should be an examination of the Council’s behaviour in future, so that we can get a reasonable revision on track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, this is not true with regard to external energy policy. It is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal and the ambitious position of Parliament were rejected by the Member States. In formal terms the Council may be right in claiming that the European Union does not have executive powers. However, it must be clear to all of us that we must all pull together in the energy sector if we are to meet the challenges of security of supply and affordable energy in the long term. As globalisation progresses and various actors in the energy markets flex their muscles, even the large Member States must realise that in the long run we can only succeed by acting in concert. This is even more the case for the smaller Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We knew from the start that our parliamentary position was very ambitious. We had to expect resistance. However, it gives one pause to realise that the Council saw no room for negotiations. Having weighed up all the options, we can agree to the results of the negotiations. After all, we have the opportunity to agree at least a legal framework, a basis on which we can build in a few years’ time. I believe that this is better than a failed legislative text that would have forced us to start again from scratch next time around. For this reason, we will vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my sincere thanks again to the rapporteurs for their commitment and for their efforts to support the Commission in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent years, the principle of equal access by different entities to transmission infrastructure and the freedom to re-export gas purchased have been openly opposed by Russia, who wants privileges. Gazprom could doubtless manage in a competitive market, but like any state-owned monopoly it fiercely defends its monopolistic position, which – in view of the underdevelopment of the market in Central Europe – enables it to dictate prices and impose contractual terms contrary to the rules of a competitive market. Intergovernmental agreements whose sole objective is to circumvent the rules of the common market are a key instrument in such unfair competition practices. A few months ago, there was an opportunity to strengthen the protection of our natural gas market by introducing control mechanisms relating to such agreements.

<p class="contents">The agreement reached in trialogue will allow the rapid implementation of the Commission’s draft decision and, wishing to be pragmatic, we cannot but welcome it. Europe of energy is making progress, admittedly slow progress, but nevertheless progress. The European Union relies heavily on imported energy, and is in a position of structural dependence on certain supplier countries. In order for our thinking on our energy strategy to become more European, it therefore became necessary to make information on energy agreements more widely available in the Commission, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements will therefore ensure greater transparency of the energy market and, thus, allow us to anticipate problems of energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that this decision does not create obligations as regards agreements between commercial entities.

Yet in their negotiations concerning energy supply they do not make use of the circumstance that the European Union, with its population of 500 million, is the world’s largest gas market. Most Member States step in the ring as featherweights against heavyweight energy exporters. There is no coordinated negotiating strategy, and the information essential for successful negotiations is unavailable. Without information exchange within the EU it is no wonder that our negotiating partners make use of their dominant positions, causing some Member States to lose by knockout.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, sharing information related to energy supply at Community level is a pre-requisite of entering the heavyweight division. Knowledge of intergovernmental agreements can facilitate the establishment of a coordinated negotiating strategy, which would allow Member States to obtain energy under more favourable conditions. The guarantee for the security of our energy supply and more favourable energy prices lies in closer cooperation between Member States, and common action. This is why I find it important for the Commission to be able to become an active participant in international negotiations upon the request of governments.

However, why was the Council so resistant in adopting it afterwards? Is this a misunderstanding or might it be interfering with monopolies?</p>
<p class="contents">It is very interesting to follow the Union’s legislative procedures. They usually begin with debates about the added value that a certain common policy would bring for all Member States. This is followed by commitments in principle to draft certain policies. Finally, the painstaking work of drafting legislative documents, in other words negotiations on how we can translate commitments in principle into legislation, begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Any new EU legislative document means partly transferring national competence to the Union. However, in many cases, Member States have been reluctant to accept this. This has also been the case with the document we are debating today. Although, so far, this has only been about setting up an information exchange mechanism and not about establishing effective control over the powers of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative text is rather weak, but it will mean that we are starting to monitor intergovernmental agreements, which will lead to a more coordinated external energy policy of the Union.</p>

As far as I can see, the worrying element is the current practice, which is undermining the internal market. We should ensure that the European energy market is transparent and liquid. We must stop the practice whereby, in connection with gas pipeline projects for third countries, agreements are entered into stating that the supply is subject to rules that are not compatible with the rules of the internal market. This is not beneficial for consumers. Nonetheless, I would urge all Members to vote in favour of the agreement, because the agreement is better than the <span class="italic">status quo</span>.

I refer to the regulation regarding security of supply, and to the measures taken to build a single internal market). The Commission’s proposal for a decision on setting up an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements required clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that during the Polish-Russian gas negotiations, the Commission had a justified complaint regarding conditions imposed by the supplier in the negotiated agreements. I also made allegations regarding failure to provide complete information. It should be emphasised that as a result of these measures, Poland has developed a working and, as it turned out, a highly effective mechanism of information exchange with the Commission. It is perhaps the only Member State to have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft decision which the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy voted through in July contains provisions regarding the Commission’s assistance in the implementation of transnational projects. An example of these are or will be the proposed negotiations by Commission on the issue of gas supply in the Caspian region. The energy balance of the EU in the light of the proposed open and free energy market should not be disrupted by irresponsible or unwise bilateral decisions. Member States should therefore share information regarding intergovernmental agreements concluded, and the Commission should be aware of the existence of such agreements and of the negotiations conducted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best way for us to ensure reliability in this regard is through a functional internal energy market. With the introduction of the third energy package, several Member States separated electricity production from transmission, which allowed for the entry of new participants to the market. However, external vulnerability still remains, meaning that the EU needs to import more than 60% of its gas and over 80% of its oil. The 2009 gas crisis, too, pointed out the vulnerability of our energy supply systems. We must find solutions as soon as possible to ensure sustainable supply to European consumers at competitive prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges we are facing include the intergovernmental energy supply agreements concluded by Member States with third countries, as these agreements can sometimes have a considerable influence on the internal energy market of the EU. Therefore, in order to prevent infringements of the effective internal market rules concerning energy, we need reinforced cooperation and accurate information exchange between Member States. Experience has shown that the Commission’s participation in Member States’ negotiations with third parties can have a positive impact on the outcome of the negotiations. In many cases this can help ensure conformity with the internal market rules, and can guarantee that the agreements are not contrary to EU laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share the same goal of pooling our forces, strengthening the internal market and improving our position in relation to the procurement and delivery of primary energy through transparency, competition and consultation. I also agree with the criticism expressed concerning the lack of cooperation from the Council. The Council’s call on the Commission to present proposals for how to improve external energy policy does not sit well with its daily work of evaluating and rejecting the implementation of the proposals drawn up and presented by the Commission in accordance with its duties. Because this was a strategic question, it was all the more important to achieve this result. If we had not done so, we would have needed a new approach. We have already had a number of approaches to this topic. We now have at least a number of building blocks developed by Parliament and the Council in the legislative proposal. We will now use these. We will then report back to you on how they work in practice. I am certain that the Commission will come up with proposals in two or three years’ time for how this common external energy strategy can be further developed and improved in a second step.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked how external energy policy in particular can be linked with foreign policy in general. I have an excellent working relationship with my colleague, Baroness Ashton. We consult closely. In general, energy policy has precedence when it comes to relations with third countries. There can be exceptions to this. I will illustrate this with an example. From an energy policy perspective, boycotting the purchasing of oil from Iran is disadvantageous. It gives us one fewer source of fuel. Some Member States, such as Greece, Italy and Spain, have a problem with this because they buy up to 30% of their oil from Iran. However it is clear that if we are to have an agreed, consistent policy in relation to Iran, then the boycott on purchasing oil must be seen not just from an energy policy perspective, but also from an overall perspective. Hence the need for coordination. In this particular case, energy policy must cede to foreign policy and security policy. Once again: as a rule, the Directorate General for Energy has operative responsibility and we have particular interests in external energy policy that cannot be subordinated to general foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nabucco has been mentioned and the question of how we are to make progress in tapping into new fuel sources. I am certain that it will take until 2018 before significant volumes of oil reach the European market from Azerbaijan, adding another source alongside Russia, Norway, Algeria and our own deposits from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as LNG gas for the gas markets of Europe. We are confident that in nine months’ time, decisions will be made in relation to the specific Nabucco, Nabucco-West, TANAP and TAP lines. It still remains to be seen whether we shall receive gas from Azerbaijan only, or whether volumes of gas from Turkmenistan or Iraq will follow, so that the southern corridor will become an equally significant gas corridor to match long-standing relations with Russia, Norway and Algeria.</p>

<p class="contents">In summarising it all, let us remember what exactly our main task – the task of politicians – is with regard to energy policy in this particular case. We must think about European energy consumers, about how to ensure competition, to ensure better, lower, fairer prices for our people. Although this draft law is not perfect, it is an important first step towards establishing this information-exchange mechanism, and it will set real foundations, the first legislative foundations on which a common European Union foreign policy on energy will be built. We have some critics who say that they want a perfect law right away, but ladies and gentlemen, let us remember that for a law to be improved – and believe me, virtually any law can always be improved – a law must have been adopted in the first place. There must be a law adopted, and here we have the opportunity to do so, to take the first steps, and to also improve this law as needed by working together in the future.</p>

It is a signal that Russia has something to hide in terms of its gas contracts. We cannot let this go unnoticed. The new law on intergovernmental agreements is an initial important step towards Member States working together and sharing information. It means that we improve the prospects of cooperation within the European Union, but also the prospects of a fair price from Russia. I regret that this legislation does not go further to provide for even closer cooperation in the exchange of information between states.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iratxe García Pérez, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two legislative proposals comprise the so-called ‘quality package’, which was presented in December 2010: one on agricultural product quality schemes, which basically covers the rules on geographical indications and other voluntary schemes, and the other amending the articles in the single common market organisation (CMO) that refer to the marketing standards that agricultural products should fulfil to be sold within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the latter, the Council has not been able to agree on a full negotiating mandate, meaning we have not even been able to debate the position adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development over a year ago, a position that Mr Dantin has now included in his report on the single CMO. I hope this wider context leads to negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the proposal for regulation before us today, the trialogue concluded with an agreement on 20 June 2012, an agreement we hope to see ratified in this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">After the ‘milk package’, it is the second agricultural dossier to be adopted by means of the ordinary legislative procedure, and it was a good running-in process to undertake the important negotiations that await us with the reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea behind the geographical indications system is to protect designations that identify a product as originating from a particular area and to attribute to it the quality, reputation and other characteristics that differentiate and enhance it, due to either its origin or its mode of production.</p>
<p class="contents">It undoubtedly means a potential economic opportunity for farmers and food producers, which is very beneficial to the rural economy, although it is first and foremost a system for registering and protecting intellectual property rights, a system that has been in place since 1992 and is already one of the hallmarks of European agriculture. Since then, it has protected registered product names in the Union in a uniform and harmonised manner. Proof of its success can be seen in the fact that there has been a constant increase in registered products since the system was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal was not as far reaching as expected given the overview contained in the Green Paper. It must be acknowledged, however, that the system has been simplified and harmonised, and coherent rules have been put in place as required. One of the objectives the Commission took very much into account in their proposals was the strengthening and simplification of quality systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight other improvements, such as the strengthening of monitoring rules. Each Member State is a market, not only for its own ‘designation of origin’ or ‘protected geographical indication’ (PGI) products, but also for those from other Member States. They should all ensure the appropriate use and effective protection of all the indications.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of Union logos will be compulsory from now on. This is essential to rectify the lack of consumer knowledge of the geographical indication system.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG) scheme is not undergoing such a radical change as was initially proposed. A transitional period for TSGs to exist without reserving a name has been established, a simplified system is introduced, and a 30-year period is established for the use of the term ‘traditional’.</p>
<p class="contents">A quality system is set up for mountain farming products, as requested by Parliament, the operation and details of which will be developed by the Commission, ensuring it has a uniform, community-based focus. I will take this opportunity, Commissioner, to pass on to you a question that I have been asked more than once since we reached the agreement: When do you estimate this quality system will be ready and in operation?</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the role of producer groups is strengthened and acknowledged more than in the initial proposal, although not as much as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have liked. Those present here know that every effort was made so that the final agreement would give them an active role in the repositioning of production to the market, as was agreed with ‘designation of origin’ or PGI cheese producers in the milk package.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not possible with this regulation. It was not possible to overcome the Council’s opposition to accepting for this case what it had already approved for the dairy sector. For our part, almost all the political groups have acted constructively by adopting the agreement we have reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dacian Cioloş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, today’s vote in Parliament marks an important development in the European Union’s agricultural product quality policy. As a member of the European Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have always attached great importance to this subject, for I believe that the future of the European agricultural product industry, particularly on the international market, resides in its quality and diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the compromise reached during the trialogue of 20 June. I would like to point out that this trialogue took place in a truly constructive atmosphere, which I welcome, because we managed to reach a balanced and satisfactory outcome. The end result of this work is a compromise in the best meaning of the word: everyone has given a little or ceded on one point or another, including on important points, and everyone has also achieved genuine improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms García Pérez is of the view that the Commission’s proposals were not very ambitious. However, on other points, the Commission too expected Parliament to be more ambitious in relation to its own proposals. So finally I think that we have managed to reach a compromise which is satisfactory for all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank Ms García Pérez for her constructive approach and her endeavour to understand the reasons behind the Commission’s proposal on points that I think are essential if we want to be able to say that there has been an improvement in the agricultural product quality policy. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur as well as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which contributed a great deal to this project, and also the Council, the Danish Presidency and the previous Presidencies for their hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a well-balanced, satisfactory text on the table. It is true to say that the future regulation on quality systems will allow us to reinforce and simplify European policy on quality. From now on, we shall have a single instrument for geographical indications, designations of origin, traditional specialities and optional quality mentions. It will bring significant improvements to the protection scheme for these quality instruments that will create greater visibility for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework for a coherent, strengthened, quality policy will undoubtedly best serve all the different producers, products and consumers in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore conclude by confirming that the Commission supports this political agreement and I hope that Parliament will adopt it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Ms García Pérez’ question concerning the specific mention for mountain areas, we shall finalise the proposal as soon as the impact assessment has been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying a few words about comitology. During the trialogue on the draft regulation, the Commission agreed not to adopt the draft implementing act if the committee responsible for it did not provide an opinion, in which case Article 5(4), third subparagraph of Regulation No 182/2011 will apply. That goes against the Commission’s general rule, but in this particular case, agreement could not have been reached if it had made an objection on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in a spirit of compromise, the Commission was reluctant to oppose a qualified majority in favour of the Presidency’s text and wishes to make the following statement: the Commission stresses that it is against the spirit of Regulation No 182/2011 to invoke Article 5(4), second subparagraph, point b), systematically. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to waive the general rule whereby the Commission can adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that this is an exception to the general rule provided for in Article 5(4), recourse to point b) of the second subparagraph cannot simply be considered to be a discretionary power of the legislator, but must be interpreted strictly and must therefore be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to note that the two institutions have thought it appropriate to continue discussions on trading standards, in particular, and also on other points which had initially been envisaged in this draft regulation within the framework of the reform of the common agricultural policy currently being discussed, and the Commission will provide the support needed to ensure a successful outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now have around 1 000 such designations in Europe and each year these account for sales of around EUR 15 billion, representing 4.5% of our food market in Europe. These products are constantly gaining in importance. These figures show just how important these designations of origin have become.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank for her cooperation in recent months, has already indicated the benefits of the new regulation. We shall have less red tape, greater public protection for designations of origin and new designation options, such as the ‘mountain products’ designation the Commissioner has just mentioned. That is major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that we have not succeeded in apportioning greater importance to the support consortia. There is no doubt that these products are perceived by consumers as brands. Anyone who claims that consumers do not recognise names like Pata Negra or Parmigiano Reggiano as brands is misunderstanding the situation. Support consortia lack a central element in market leadership, however. They are unable to decide on the amount of product to be put on offer. Unfortunately it has not been possible to reach agreement in this area with the Council, which is notable by its absence today. I hope that we will manage to find such agreement during the debate on agricultural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it quite unhelpful that an amendment should now be tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which we are to vote on tomorrow and which moves in this direction. My group agrees with the substance of this amendment and would vote in favour if this was the only issue. We know, however, that this would prevent the adoption of the regulation at first reading, which is why we shall have to vote against it. Thus, this is not particularly helpful and achieves no progress. I hope that the Greens will support us when we raise this subject as part of agricultural reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As happened with the Milk Regulation, Parliament has again managed to introduce significant amendments to improve the Commission’s proposal. I would highlight, for example, the stricter rules to protect certified products against misuse and imitation (the so-called <span class="italic">ex officio</span> rule); the new system of optional quality terms, starting with the ‘product of mountain farming’ quality term; area marks; and greater simplification in the authorisation procedures for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) products. I would also like to mention the amendment to the list in the annex, which at last makes it possible for chocolate to enjoy a protected geographical indication. Allow me to take this opportunity to greet the friends of Modica chocolate who are here in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just a few of the many amendments that Parliament has successfully introduced to strengthen the prospect of leveraging quality in order to compete in the sector. This was made possible by the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, whom I thank, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The only regrettable fact, as the rapporteur herself mentioned, is that Parliament has not managed to persuade the Council of the need to extend production planning, which we usefully introduced in the milk package, to all the other protected designations of origin, particularly in the ham sector. However, as has been pointed out by Mr Dorfmann, one of the shadow rapporteurs, we shall not fail to do so in the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy, and on the single common market organisation document in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did not succeed in controlling marketing standards or the regulation of supply. We now intend doing this in the common organisation of the markets.

We see that the Council is not here today, as Mr Dorfmann says, and they have not treated us well throughout this process. Amendment 87 was a key priority for our committee, but it was not taken seriously enough. We have retabled it as Amendment 103, and I do urge colleagues to support it. If that means that we do not get a first-reading agreement, then we come back as colegislator to do our job.</p>

<p class="contents">By improving the quality of agricultural output, not only will the supply side move agriculture away from the production of basic raw-material commodities, for which it receives basic raw-material prices, but there will also be an opportunity to add real value to the products.</p>
<p class="contents">The types of strategy that might come into play here include building and exploiting regional identities, building and exploiting brands and points of differentiation, and better marketing of products whether that be through cooperation, strategic alliances or moving closer to the marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategies do not just add considerably to producers’ incomes, they can also create and sustain a large number of jobs in the rural sector, they contribute strongly to growth in the rural economy, and they will significantly reduce dependence on subsidy support from the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have two criticisms of this report. First, it is too focused on the domestic or European market. We should not forget that European products possess some of the best-recognised and strongest identities in the world, but that export potential is not being fully exploited at the present time. I therefore suggest that we should be doing more to help stimulate this important trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we are keen to support and encourage regional and producer organisations. But such organisations should not be empowered to restrict or control output levels. In practice, that would amount to an unofficial quota system which, in the short term, would be anti-competitive and, in the long term, would mean missing opportunities for efficiency gains and wider market exploitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The course of events started back in 2009 with our own-initiative report on quality products, which highlighted certain important issues on which we have achieved results today and others on which we still have work to do. The outcome we have secured is a success for all those producers, associations and cooperatives that have supported us over these years, and acknowledges their commitment to quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of their work is highlighted in this report, since the Member States are enabled to promote the establishment and operation of such groups. The positive outcomes obtained are due to the teamwork shown by Parliament’s delegation to the meetings with the other institutions. They include <span class="italic">ex officio</span> protection, whereby the Member States must protect products with quality marks, even where they are used as ingredients in processed products, without waiting for producers to make a complaint.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the measures introduced in Mr Nicholson’s report on contractual relations in the milk and milk products sector, production management for quality marks in other sectors has been left out of the report now being debated. It was simply not possible to reach agreement on production planning, a crucial issue for our producers. They wanted this instrument above all to make it possible to balance demand and supply. We will continue working alongside our fellow Members to achieve this outcome as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I would like to thank the Italian associations that represent the cooperatives, which have worked with us and will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Northern Ireland has, to date, three protected geographical indications: the early Comber potato, the Armagh Bramley apple and the Lough Neagh eel. While I welcome the official recognition of these products, there must be adequate safeguards in place to protect not only the standing of the products but also the scheme itself. This report goes some way to addressing that.</p>
<p class="contents">If quality schemes are to be meaningful and useful in the marketing of products, then it is imperative that those products retain their authenticity. This is especially true of products that require traditional production steps but must also be manageable in today’s global market. It is important too that the registration and monitoring of those using quality schemes must be fit for purpose but not restrictive. The success of a quality scheme will depend on its capacity to stay relevant to the consumer and to add value whilst maintaining exclusivity and regional brand identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while we continue to improve quality schemes in the EU, I think Parliament and the Commission should do more to protect EU citizens from poor-quality imports which do not meet the same high standards, and should put an end to the hypocrisy in this regard and the unfair competition for our farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us.</p>
<p class="contents">The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions. Supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended, and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless we are well on the way, and the numbers of people who do know this mark are rising steadily. I firmly believe that this system mainly needs long-term stability. Only thus can we reach a situation where all consumers will know it and take account of it in their decision-making. Frequent and extensive changes will not help us, and will only lead to confusion.

Quality must be worthwhile, however. For this reason, I expressly welcome the fact that the decision on the quality package will create measures that will highlight European quality and further secure protected designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional specialities. It is also very important that these products should be protected beyond Europe’s borders and that processes cannot be cheaply copied. Successful programmes are recognised by consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have very positive experience with brand registration in Austria. The designated products enjoy a good reputation. However, measures are required on a Europe-wide basis that will promote sales and increase brand recognition. At the same time, we also need measures to enable more of such brands to be registered. Agricultural producers need user-friendly support with registration.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expressly welcome the introduction of labelling for products from mountain areas. This is clearly the handiwork of the European Parliament and I would like to thank the negotiators for their dedication in this context. This new, counterfeit-proof label is a milestone for dairy producers. Milk production in mountain areas is hard work and is associated with the highest quality standards. Consumers associate products from mountain regions with an untouched landscape, cows freely grazing the meadows, feeding on hay in the winter, and small farms. It must be possible for the greater effort and higher production costs involved to command a better product price. We need to keep on working on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the proposals on mountain products also need to apply to island agricultural products, so that they too can be integrated into the voluntary quality scheme. We all understand the peculiarities of islands, their serious and permanent drawbacks, their physical and demographic problems, their distance from the mainland, their small size, their difficult terrain, their specific climate and their dependence on activities with limited potential. Many of these elements lend specific and particular quality characteristics to agricultural products and the labelling of such products as island products would increase their added value. I would therefore ask the Commissioner to stipulate what action is planned to promote these prospects and, of course, if possible, within what timeframe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very pleased that the report now obliges the Commission to present a report to Parliament and to the Council on the case for a new local-farming and direct sales labelling scheme. This is a genuine step forward in the promotion of a short supply chain and locally produced food. Farmers will now be given a real opportunity to acquire added value for their products by means of the new labels. We nevertheless have to ensure that the new labelling scheme becomes suitable for all Member States. Restrictions that are too harsh will do nothing to encourage this excellent initiative.

It has not been easy, by any means, but it is good that we have managed to reach a final agreement.</p>

In this regard, it is definitely something that our agriculture sector should be exploring as part of the strategy, in order to ensure its future growth and sustainability especially in relation to exports.</p>

I hope that it will help us make certification schemes simpler and more transparent, adaptable to innovation and less burdensome for producers and consumers. Farmers will certainly continue to focus on quality, but they expect us to create the necessary conditions for them to secure a fair return on their investment, not forgetting that the imposition of such high production standards, in terms of food security, animal welfare and environmental sustainability, is reflected in a higher final product price. Consumers who demand quality from European producers end up buying cheaper and poorer-quality imported products. This is our challenge: to invest in quality, secure a fair income for producers and provide a reasonable option for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that Parliament will adopt the agreement that we have reached, through the discussion of certain elements in the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). I think that it would be a pity to block the decision on this Quality Package and hold it up on the grounds of points which we can discuss and clarify at the time of the CAP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you pointed to the discussion on quality-related volume control, which did not lead to an agreement between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am open to pursuing this discussion with you and with the Council in the context of CAP reform, with a view to determining how the monitoring of volumes might have a positive impact on quality, and I am ready to take this aspect into account, if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this legislative proposal, if it is adopted, will create a proper framework for encouraging producers to register their products and for ensuring that the quality of agricultural products in the European Union is more obvious in the marketplace. The advantage of this regulation, to reply to Mr Tabajdi, who unfortunately is no longer here, is that, once this regulation comes into force, all Member States will have to apply the same labelling and quality mentions. This will make it easier for European customers, throughout the Member States, to identify quality products from the same category.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have spoken about the export potential for quality products. The Union is indeed one of the top exporters of agricultural products and foodstuffs in the world, but, unlike other global partners, such as the United States, which export mainly raw materials, we primarily export added value, with quality products. The regulation that we are about to adopt will make negotiations for the recognition of this system of geographical indication outside the European Union easier for us with our international partners and consequently easier to ensure the legal protection of these products on external markets.</p>
<p class="contents">That will allow us not only to promote quality more effectively outside the Union, but also to protect our quality products against counterfeits still to be found on the market. Admittedly these counterfeits are proof that European products are appreciated by consumers outside the Union. However, we now need the legal framework to be able to protect our producers from these counterfeits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also plans to present a legislative proposal with a view to promoting agricultural products and foodstuffs on the European market and abroad. It intends to promote actively quality labels and ensure that the European consumer recognises them. We shall invest money to promote the logo that we have designed as part of this regulation, so that European consumers are better able to identify quality products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as local products and products of island farming are concerned, you asked the Commission for reports. I can assure you that the Commission has already started to carry out evaluation work on the quality potential of local products and products from short production and distribution chains. The same work is being carried out for products of mountain farming. It will also be carried out for products of island farming. Finally, at the end of this year, the Commission will present a report, possibly accompanied by legislative proposals for registering these quality labels. I can assure you that this is indeed our intention and that we have already started to work on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you again for your support for this legislative proposal. I hope it will lead to a vote in favour tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regional diversity of food, the traditional methods of production, and the emphasis on safety and good environmental conditions lead to the fact that the quality of European food is among the highest in the world. We must also demand this from third-country products entering the EU. Farmers and consumers alike need to be made aware of these special characteristics of their home-grown food. This quality-oriented approach could help reward the best-quality products on the domestic, as well as international markets. These labels and quality schemes provide recognition for the high-value characteristics of the products and also for the regional specificities of the products. The current quality schemes are: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG), Organic Farming and Outermost Regions, all with their respective logos. They bring greater added value for farmers and consumers. I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s initiative, which urges the Commission to make these schemes easier to understand and to extend them to ‘products of island farming’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European food producers provide consumers with very varied and mostly very high-quality food. They are creating protected European marks that represent their history and their quality. The current quality regimes include the protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG), products of organic farming and the most remote regions. The food in these systems is marked out by its own logo, enabling rapid recognition by the consumer. The food quality and labelling system helps successful promotion on both the European and global market. It is essential to continue this effort and to continue improving the policy on food and product quality. The Commission’s new proposal sets out the aim of modifying EU legislation in the area of quality, and improving the functioning of national and private certification systems so that they are simpler, more transparent and comprehensible, and more adaptable to innovation and rapid progress. It is also important to reduce the burden they impose on producers and administrators. The report on the quality of agricultural products is a benefit for European legislation, the agricultural market, producers and consumers, and I therefore support its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective is simple: to establish a European label.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards entrepreneurship, it is one tool among a number of provisions. In any event, I hope that the Commission will take ownership of entrepreneurship, which is a driver of growth, and that it will consider a number of provisions, mechanisms and tools associated with social entrepreneurship. I am going to let my colleague Mr Lamberts speak on venture capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak on two matters. Firstly, what are the issues raised in this text? Secondly, why are we voting on it tomorrow in plenary?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as regards the issues raised in this text, what is the aim pursued? The aim is twofold: to foster the development of social investment and also to diversify the funding sources of social undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">What is a social undertaking? The principle objective of a social undertaking is to achieve a positive social impact. It is, for example, to ensure that its human resources, its collaborators, include vulnerable or marginalised persons. A social undertaking is one whose objective is to support social activity. Today, these undertakings are mainly financed through grants. We all know that Member States and communities will find it harder and harder to support funding through grants. Therefore, these undertakings see their future compromised, at a time when they need sustainable growth and to bring about innovation. We must help them to find other sources of funding so that we can improve our social market economy. In this respect, I must point out that social entrepreneurship accounts for 10% of European undertakings and 11 million employees. The social investment market is already very active in a number of Member States which are experiencing high levels of growth, but it is, unfortunately, very fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the world of finance is so reviled, I find it satisfying that this text is able to demonstrate that profit is not the be all and end all for this world of finance, and that finance can and must play a major role in the social economy and the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like Mr Barnier to know how much I welcome this proactive approach. Traditionally, the Commission had a relationship of regulation and control with finance, which was appropriate. Today, we are committed to a proactive approach, the aim of which is to give an impetus to put finance at the service of the real economy. I am grateful to the Commission for adopting this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we voting on this text tomorrow in plenary? We worked actively on it this summer. My objective was twofold. It was to obtain accessibility and security, because this label must be open and accessible, but not at any price and not to just anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we reached agreement in the trialogue – I am sorry for taking slightly longer than my allotted time, Mr President, but the issue is a little complicated – and I will ask my colleagues to support this agreement tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will follow us immediately when we have adopted this regulation. I would remind you that it is a true driver of economic growth and a vehicle for inclusion and progress for our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Philippe Lamberts, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, friends of culture, good taste and venture capital, good evening. How good it feels to be among friends in the Chamber in Strasbourg – such an intimate place – this, still summer, evening. Thank you to the many members of the public for being here, and for coming to applaud the performance of the two rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Joking aside, the issue of venture capital is important because it is a fact that, in the EU today, we need investment. Our economy has been hijacked too often these last 30 years, both publicly and privately, by, essentially, consumption and speculation at the expense of value-added investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that venture capital plays an important role, especially in driving innovation. It must be recognised that, in the EU, we have a process of innovation that is, without doubt, excessively regulated. What we have, therefore, is top-down innovation, where the objectives set by the Commission or by the Member States, for example, stimulate innovation. This can be distinguished from the American model of bottom-up innovation, where people risk both their money and their reputation on innovations, not all of which succeed – far from it. However, this is a model we would do well to draw on, not to simply adopt it but to achieve a better balance between top-down innovation, which is guided by regulation, bottom-up innovation, which is guided by investment, and innovation I would characterise as autonomous, which is guided by the market and stakeholders on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy to encourage venture capital because, first of all, it is, of course, a question of culture. If, in Europe, we have a culture that is just a tad allergic to risk, it is clear that this will not change overnight. Nevertheless, it is good to do whatever we can to remove regulatory obstacles or, rather, to establish mechanisms that encourage venture capital. In this context, the Commission proposal to create a European venture capital funds passport, which is to some extent a guarantee of quality and also a guarantee of access to the entire internal market, is a good idea.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, the issue should have been simple, and it was. The negotiations were quite speedy. In the end, there were not many points of divergence between us. One of the issues was whether or not it was necessary to have a system of depositaries with a view to protecting the consumer. We, rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, decided together that venture capital is perhaps an area where, in fact, we want to encourage risk, with investors who know a bit about the risks they are taking, and that, when addressing professionals, concern for consumer protection can become a sideshow to considerations of efficiency. We therefore abandoned the system of depositaries to finalise an agreement in short order on 28 June which was welcomed by the three partners: Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Commission for helping us to reach an agreement in relatively short order.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, I was surprised to discover, five or seven days later, I do not remember – I am sure Ms Auconie will remind me – almost via a rumour, that the Council had reneged on its agreement. At this point I would like to say that, in terms of procedure, it is unacceptable. It is possible to realise that one has gone too far in negotiations, that too many concessions have been made and so on, but an agreement is an agreement. When an agreement has been reached, when it has been announced and welcomed, well then, it is honoured. That is what we are going to do tomorrow, when we vote on this text. I therefore call on Parliament not to try to outsmart the Council, that is to say to reverse its original positions and to act as if it were going to recommence negotiations. No, we are faithful to the procedure we have gone through and the agreement we have reached, and it is in these terms, in these exclusive terms, that we will proceed to the vote tomorrow. I therefore encourage you to support us in this and I hope that I will hear a lot of encouragement in this respect from the many members of the public who are present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to say a few words this evening on these two important subjects of venture capital and social entrepreneurship on behalf of my colleague, Mr Barnier, who was unable to join you this evening due to the informal Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council which will take place in Cyprus tomorrow. At this moment, therefore, he must be somewhere in the skies above us.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in recent years there have been too many signs suggesting, rightly or wrongly, that finance was an activity serving the financial stakeholders personally instead of moving the economy forward as a whole. It is up to us to reverse this trend and to use every means available to us to improve the financing of companies. This is a crucial step towards economic recovery and sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Since April 2011 and the adoption of the Single Market Act by the Commission, important steps have been taken to boost the competitiveness of our enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs – by way of reminder, there are almost 22 million in the EU – are the backbone of the EU economy and of its capacity to innovate and create jobs. However, unlike other regions of the world, the European Union has been late in detecting and encouraging these champions of tomorrow through a sustainable, growth-oriented funding framework, that of venture capital. These growth drivers are badly needed today, especially in new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, enterprises that pursue so-called ‘social’ objectives have huge potential for sustainable growth, which we need. These enterprises create a social link thanks to their policy of inclusion in favour of the most disadvantaged citizens, in particular by enabling many people who are out of work to return to employment. The pursuit of social, ethical and environmental objectives can generate positive external effects for a country. They can also help revitalise some of our regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding today falls fully within this context. Finance must once again serve the real economy, which innovates and creates jobs. Europe has financial resources; it even has one of the highest savings rates in the world. These savings must be channelled towards sectors with the greatest need and, primarily, towards the SMEs operating in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission has proposed establishing a new legislative framework for European venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds. Through these proposals, these funds will be able to obtain a single marketing authorisation, valid throughout Europe, which will enable them to collect money far more easily from investors.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very grateful to the rapporteurs, Mr Lamberts and Ms Auconie, and to the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done on both these issues. Many technical questions were resolved quickly under the Danish Presidency, and we are satisfied with the political agreement reached on the last day of this Presidency. We welcome the spirit of cooperation and compromise which made it possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, therefore, there is broad agreement between the Council and Parliament in the many areas covered by these two reports. However, there is one outstanding issue, that of tax havens. I am fully at one with you in the fight against tax havens. I believe that these types of tax systems are a major problem which must be resolved as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also believe that these two proposals cannot be the hostages of a single issue. When there is agreement on practically all of the content and when the disagreement relates solely to a very specific element, all means must be deployed to break the stalemate. All of us in this House are aware of the time we would lose and that companies would lose if we went to second reading. I would therefore urge you to pick up the thread of the discussions with the Council as soon as possible on this last point. The Commission is ready to facilitate a new compromise on this.</p>
<p class="contents">From our perspective, an envisageable solution could be constructed on four pillars. First, the inclusion in the instrument, that is to say in the very text of the directive, of a clause reproducing an existing article of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive. This clause, which makes reference to the OECD Model Tax Convention, has already been accepted by the Member States. Second, the retention of the existing recitals on tax havens. Third, a Commission declaration on the establishment of harmonised standards for the identification of tax havens. Fourth, the mention of a revision clause in the regulations by which the Commission undertakes to promote, if necessary, additional measures to ensure that venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds are not domiciled in tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always been committed to ensuring compliance with international law on taxation and will continue to fight against all forms of tax evasion. With its draft declaration on tax havens, it wishes to clearly reaffirm its principles and its utter resolve. However, today, it is essential that we undertake to move forward rapidly towards the adoption of both these texts, because the ultimate aim is to facilitate the funding of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we can send a strong signal to all economic stakeholders to show them that Europe has understood the extent of the problems and is there to propose solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last week, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, in an excellent conference organised by Commissioner Andor, emphasised that the European social model was an element of EU competitiveness and that social entrepreneurship clearly formed part of this. The proposal we have on the table is therefore welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that we must ensure – and that was the subject matter of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) – that, through these social entrepreneurship funds, we do not create new niches in financial markets. I have to say that, from this point of view, we have two concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">We had asked in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the issue of social housing be treated specifically, and I think that that would have been valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say that the response from the Commissioner representing Commissioner Barnier on the establishment of such funds in tax havens is, in my view, problematic, as, once again, it is not a question of creating new niches or nouveaux riches but of fostering a new, highly promising sector, that of the social market economy, through social entrepreneurship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in my Member State – Bulgaria – it is as if the companies which have a social element disappeared during the transition. They disappeared as communism disappeared from Bulgaria. I personally have had business relations with a company employing people with impaired hearing, and I know how important it is to these people that they have an opportunity to work, be employed and earn their own living, instead of relying only on benefits and other social instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel that adopting the report on the Social Entrepreneurship Funds is a big step forward and, as I said, tying this package together truly shows the European continent’s social face.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Venture Capital Funds with regard to which I was also a rapporteur on the committee asked for an opinion, I can say that I am considering this in relation to the Commission’s promises for better financial regulation, for better financial discipline to prevent potential financial speculations in the future, thus for me this is also an important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I will say that I see that the committee responsible has elaborated the legal committee’s proposals we made in the report, therefore, I believe that we, as a committee, did our job, namely to assist the committee responsible, directing it towards the areas it has elaborated in our proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we face this challenge of growth and investment at a time when Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises are suffering from a funding deficit and when lending conditions have seriously deteriorated as a result of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">But the challenge is all the more demanding because Europe’s SMEs need to invest in knowledge-based undertakings, innovation and new sources of growth that can create sustainable jobs and upgrade the competitiveness of the European economy. Here the solution is a major push towards developing venture capital. This is a front on which Europe is seriously lagging behind the US. Venture capital is crucial for young enterprises, particularly in the early years of their development when, despite innovative plans and strong growth potential, they struggle to find the necessary funding. Moreover, venture initiatives can also provide companies with valuable expertise and knowledge, business contacts and strategic advice.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are debating today aims to address Europe’s growth funding deficit through an EU-wide venture capital passport. This regulation can provide a much-needed boost to kick-start some of the main drivers of growth. It is vital, therefore, to get the venture capital legislation working as soon as possible. I recommend that the House supports the compromise reached with the Danish Presidency and that negotiations continue towards a successful first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, as the S&amp;D Group, can support what is currently on the table: it is a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, we heard from Mr Barroso in his State of the Union address that we need to do everything we can to foster economic growth. Of course, we fully support this move. Investing in innovative companies with venture capital and social economy projects through social investment funds can make a difference. Developing such passports constitutes a modest, yet effective contribution towards that goal. After all, it will provide a framework that can give investors confidence and it can contribute – and you have mentioned this yourself, Commissioner – to making greater use of the available savings in the real economy. This will lead to investment in young innovative enterprises and the social economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The text that we will be voting on is a step forward on various points. There will be a passport for the funds in question and better protection for investors. It is a balanced package that came about after a series of difficult negotiations with the Council. We were therefore very surprised and disappointed that the agreement reached, which had even been officially communicated by the previous Danish Presidency, could not be finalised by the Cyprus Presidency within the time given. As a result, a number of countries had time to organise opposition and politicians blocked the agreement. These circumstances mean that although we will be able to vote on the agreement reached tomorrow, we will not be able to have a final vote at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I want the Commissioner to know that we appreciate that the Commission is coming up with proposals to push forward a compromise, but, to be honest, I think the ball is now in the Council’s court. Quite honestly, we have a deal that we have finalised and accepted and we are willing to approve it. I think that the Council should be consistent on this matter. After all, the crisis is more prominent than ever and goes far beyond these two proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is: do we, as the European Union, think it is normal to be working with a definition of tax havens that is riddled with holes? Will the fight against tax fraud at European level remain merely a verbal battle or are we actually going to tackle it effectively? We as Parliament need to stick to our guns on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of the proposals on both venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds. With these proposals we are making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain finance. That has already been said here, but it is not enough to say it just once; in view of the problems Europe is experiencing it is worth pointing it out several times.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to increase the competitiveness and growth potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. Venture capital investments can be a very valuable alternative to bank financing. In order to support the most promising start-up undertakings, the investments made by the venture capital funds need to be larger and more diversified, and the funds need to promote innovation. Social entrepreneurship in the EU must be strengthened, particularly in these times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the idea that managers of venture capital funds and social entrepreneurship funds should be able to use a quality mark, a European passport, to market their funds throughout the EU. This has been shown to work really well in other contexts. Introducing a single set of rules throughout the EU is important. That will reduce unnecessary problems and red tape. It will facilitate investment and entrepreneurship on the internal market. Certain burdensome and unnecessarily bureaucratic rules, such as the requirement for a depositary, have been dispensed with in the compromise with the Council. I think that is a good thing. I think we have found the right balance, and this really will be able to facilitate investment for Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that remains then is that of tax havens. I hope that we can find a solution. I would like to finish by saying that I think it is a pity that questions concerning taxes, including those relating to the issue of tax havens, cause such division. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made improvements to what was already a good proposal from the Commission, finally establishing a financial instrument that specifically supports the social economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not hard to achieve agreement on the fact that some of the bureaucratic red tape included there should be removed: for example it should also be possible to provide larger loans, as required for the construction of social housing, for example, or to deliver assistance to institutions that do not operate in the social economy in the EU, but rather in developing countries, so that these funds, when they are finally introduced – can also help the world’s most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been able to ensure that some criteria are worded with greater clarity, for example that it is necessary to prove the companies receiving investment from this fund have a genuine social benefit, so that these funds do not become a cheap label that people can use, even though in reality there is no social economy dimension to their business. This fund is a rational instrument within the framework of the Commission’s broader initiatives for the social economy, as currently promoted by Mr Barnier and Mr Tajani. That makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The icing on the cake would be if the positive outcome we have now achieved with the Commission were also to be worthwhile for the businesses. The only thing standing in the way here is the Council, which is absent from this debate yet again and which refuses to include a reasonable definition of tax havens in the provisions for this fund. The fact that funds like this, which have a social benefit, are not to be diverted to tax havens is something that goes without saying. This also applies to European venture capital funds. It is scandalous that the Council should allow initiatives that promote growth and the social economy to fail over an issue like a European definition of tax havens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These two reports have been specifically drafted to encourage investment in these important sectors. The EU passport for these two brands will allow cross-border business and investment and thus channel money into areas that we know are vitally important to economic growth as well as simultaneously benefiting our whole society.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that stimulating growth, particularly in the SME sector, is intrinsic to our economic recovery. The committee negotiations have been carried out in an inclusive spirit which has continued into the trialogue discussions. It is therefore a shame that negotiations have deteriorated. I believe that all political groups are keen to see successful implementation of these two reports. It is therefore a pity that this has been stalled with the addition of a topic that many argue is not immediately essential to the EU Venture Capital and Entrepreneurship Fund debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The global issue of tax evasion and the definition of tax havens, especially in light of the global economic situation, must be addressed. There is widespread acknowledgement of this and indeed the Commission has promised to come up with specific proposals. It is not standard practice, however, nor indeed Parliament’s right, to set tax policies within the Financial Services Regulation. Whatever our aspirations, we must be careful that we do not cause more harm than good.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we should look at tax havens, but at the right time with the right people on the right dossiers. There is a strong majority in the Council against the addition of Article 3. Our priority surely should be to pass these two reports without delay, taking full advantage of the agreements and improvements that the Parliament has already successfully negotiated in trialogue. We can then address tax evasion in the appropriate manner following Commission proposals. If we are serious about stimulating growth, we must allow this legislation on the Social Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Funds to come to fruition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very familiar with the second of these areas, as I have often been involved with disability associations, and my position as vice-chair of the Disability Intergroup in this Parliament has led me to listen to a large number of proposals and demands in this field. Thousands of bodies operate in this sector and help produce roughly 10% of GDP across Europe, while providing jobs for over 11 million people. As we must all realise, these are significant figures that have not only a valuable social impact but also major consequences for Europe’s entire economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more than other kinds of business, social undertakings always find it difficult to obtain credit, perhaps because it is thought – unfairly – that they cannot give sufficient assurances. In fact, though, they are often highly efficient and economically competitive. Nevertheless, it is important to remain extremely vigilant and to check carefully that these instruments are used only where there is a genuine need. Even in this field there can be speculation and interests that deviate from the real objectives for which these funds have been developed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the criteria for allocating these funds should be made much clearer, as I would not like to see them transformed into a potential new mechanism for fraud, at the expense of both Europe and the social undertakings themselves, not to mention all those people, including people with disabilities, who have considerable opportunities in this sector and expect a lot from it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, grants from the European Social Fund, for example, were used in Italy for completely different purposes from those that were initially proposed. It is absolutely disgraceful that there are people who speculate in this sector instead of helping others who have major difficulties.</p>

<p class="contents">Two texts are currently under discussion in Parliament, one on the social entrepreneurship initiative, which will be examined in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) next week, and another, which we are examining this evening. It is far from satisfactory that we are examining the second before the first, which is much more general.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, it seems to me that the definition of social enterprises presented to us today is too restrictive. I hope that it will be able to put a stop to attempts at social ‘washing’. However, once again, it reduces social enterprises, in particular those of the social economy, which are its main component, a little too much to the single issue of the most vulnerable. The stakeholders in the social economy who manage partnerships and not capital enterprises are hoping to see other signs from the European institutions, in particular the recognition that their status is different from that of capital enterprises.</p>

After all, private capital investors are actively seeking out opportunities, for example in my home country, Hungary. At the same time I must also note that the managers and owners of enterprises often have a cautious attitude towards this form of financing. In order to support the most promising start-up enterprises, venture capital funds need to be enlarged and their investments diversified. I believe that the aim of the two proposals put forward today and of these two funds is precisely to facilitate the development of this budding market.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons why I believe this is that on one hand, in the middle of the current crisis where lending to the real economy is on a decline, enterprises can have an extremely difficult time obtaining loans. On the other hand, I agree with the Commission that enterprises undertaking long-term investments and possessing venture capital are more successful than enterprises that are forced to rely on short-term bank financing. Thirdly, larger venture capital funds not only mean larger volumes of capital available to individual enterprises but also allow for specialisation in specific sectors. I am convinced that venture capital can help small and medium-sized enterprises increase their competitiveness. I am hopeful that we will be able reach an agreement at first reading, and I will, of course, support this with my vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to raise the issue of investment in social enterprises, the main aim of which is not to make a profit, but to develop those businesses whose activities are extremely valuable for society as a whole. In many Member States these companies are legally obliged to operate in exactly the same environment and according to the same rules as other enterprises, even though it is certainly far more difficult for them to attract financing and investment for their business. Often a social enterprise is fundamentally a business that is based on an organisation, a foundation or voluntary work, and which needs capital for it to operate. I believe that this Rrgulation will boost confidence in social entrepreneurship funds and among investors in them, and enhance the reputation of such funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned here, we should not be naïve; good intentions will not prevent attempts at abuse, and that is why it is important to support proposals to stop abuse of funds of this sort or distortion of competition between different funds. For the sake of greater confidence, we also need to investigate openly loopholes in connection with tax evasion and tax havens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to all of you.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you, in this conclusion, that one in four enterprises in the EU is a social enterprise. I would like to remind you that the social investment market is worth EUR 1 billion. Mr Lamberts, there are not many of us here in this Chamber, but I am certain that many entrepreneurs, in particular social entrepreneurs, are watching us live on Parliament’s website. I would like to say to them, and to all of you here, that social entrepreneurship is not a niche and that the European label represents genuine added value for Europe if we define it responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have said, Commissioner, today we need to improve funding for social enterprises and we must not be hostages of a single issue. As we have all demonstrated, a second reading would be a real waste of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore ask all my colleagues, in a very socially inclusive manner, to support me and to support the agreement reached in the trialogue in the session and during the vote tomorrow. I hope, then, that the Council will take our lead to ensure that this regulation is adopted quickly. It is, I would remind you, a driver of growth for our economy and a vehicle for inclusion and progress for our society.</p>

It is therefore rather difficult to negotiate like that of course. Therefore, I am going to address you to tell you that we must make sure that we do not distort reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an agreement. It is not that there remains a small obstacle to an agreement; we have an agreement. Simply, one of the two parties did not keep the promise it had made in public. There is therefore a real problem of confidence between the negotiating partners. I am sorry, these things are just not done.</p>
<p class="contents">They may have realised in retrospect that they had gone too far, that they had made too many concessions, but it was a matter for them. It was for them to prepare and manage their negotiations properly. If they are incapable of doing so, that is their lookout. That is what it is like in business. If you are outsmarted because of poor negotiating skills, that is the price you pay. The Council spurns this House too often to be passed the sponge and to be told, ‘We understand that you have messed up a bit, so we are going to discuss it again’. No! I am in favour of an agreement at first reading. Well, it is very easy. If we want an agreement at first reading, we keep our word, they keep theirs and that is it, end of story. If they want to do something else, it is going to be expensive, it is going to be hard and it could go on and on. You are going to say that it will take an important issue hostage. Yes, of course. It is not the first time either that the Council has taken Parliament hostage on other issues. They must stop abusing our trust, because I find that unconscionable.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the compromise proposals, the Commission, always disposed to put forward proposals, is clearly recognisable and I very much welcome that. I just want to say that the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) clause is exactly what we did not want. The AIFM clause is a paper tiger! Today, according to the OECD, there is no longer any jurisdiction on their black list. You are in Liechtenstein? You are ‘clean’! You are in the Cayman Islands? You are ‘clean’! You are ‘clean’ throughout the world! There are no tax havens any more. We no longer have to fight against tax havens. It is precisely to avoid this situation that we want to establish in an article – and not just in recitals – serious standards on tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">They must stop making us empty promises just to please us, telling us, ‘Look, we are working hard to combat tax havens’. This kind of cinema is over.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Ms Auconie and the many shadow rapporteurs who are here. In any event, we worked well together, and we intend to continue to do so. It is therefore not just a Green telling you that it is going to be hard if the Council persists, it is the entire Parliament telling you.</p>

Social enterprises are exclusively small and medium-sized enterprises, and their mission reflects a strong emphasis on sustainable development, or development that supports the inclusion and resolution of the EU's social problems. This means that investments in social enterprises should have a greater positive social impact than general investments in small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposed regulation is to create a legislative framework adapted to the needs of social enterprises. It focuses on a clear elucidation of the properties that distinguish social enterprise funds from the broader category of alternative investment funds. Only funds that fulfil these characteristics are eligible for resources as social enterprise funds on the basis of the proposed European framework. It introduces unified requirements for the administration of entities identified as a European social enterprise fund, for investment portfolios, investment techniques and the eligible enterprises on which they can focus. Unified rules make it possible to utilise a valid certificate of registration for European social enterprise funds throughout the EU. Issues of transparency are also resolved. Investments are directed towards social return or a positive social impact. Funds must be supported with corresponding tax rules in the EU. The concept of social enterprises forms part of the programme of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, which therefore supports it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title28"></a><a name="creitem28"></a>

This issue is clearly not of interest to everyone in plenary this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">With these safeguard regulations we are still feeling our way somewhat in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, because the roles of the various institutions and where certain things are regulated are still unclear. Thus we now have to incorporate a number of items in the legislation, by which I mean the ordinary legislation, that have already been included in the wording of the Treaty and in the Council’s decision, but which were in the wrong place. That is why it is good practice to take a closer look at the overall process of establishing this safety net for the agreement with Colombia and Peru.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we are placing demands on Colombia and Peru in the agreement and now we must also see how we can define the requirements that we place on ourselves. It is also important that the safety net should remain practicable. It makes little sense to set down regulations that are never applied. This is how things were done in the past. For this reason, we should exercise the powers we have to dust down the safety net legislation so that we can apply it in a positive way.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are concerned about five points. The first is to see what the actual criteria are for casting a safety net. I am quite convinced that, in order to determine when something is having a detrimental effect on the market, we must also address the issue of social standards because, of course, the violation of social standards leads to dumping and can give rise to competitive advantages. Accordingly, this is one of the criteria for applying safety nets, particularly in the area of bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second point. If we are cautious in our approach to the Treaty of Lisbon, then we will naturally find ourselves being more and more cautious about the role of the European Parliament. It is fundamental for us that we, like all the other European institutions, should have the power to launch an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that if we are serious about more transparency, then this also means that we must include civil society in our dialogue to a greater extent and that this should be institutionalised when we come to examine this agreement with Colombia and Peru. That is why I want to strengthen dialogue with civil society. We need more transparency. Commissioner, you always refer to the safeguard regulations with Korea as a template. The problem is that you have forgotten Article 11 of the agreement with Korea when it comes to the issue of the transparency of monitoring and reporting. I am referring to the requirement that a report must be presented that covers all the different angles, which is something we want to see guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth issue relates to providing security for the banana producers in Europe’s regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore very much concur in my report with what my colleague said earlier, so I can keep my speech a little shorter.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are two aspects to the discussions currently under way – a technical aspect and another aspect that is a great deal broader. The technical aspect is relatively easy to explain: the safeguard clause is intended to protect European producers against unfair competition as a market is opened up, particularly in those areas close to this new market. We have done our utmost to frame the safeguard clauses so as to enable this to work, but also in such a way that free trade will be able to function more effectively in the future. Of course there are different opinions on how to achieve this, however I believe that we have found some good compromises that will help bring things to a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a second aspect that is perhaps more philosophical in nature, because it directly addresses the fundamental question: should trade policy just be restricted to trade policy, or should it go further? This is a question that has always concerned us in our discussions regarding the safeguard clause. I should state that the safeguard clause is just one small element in this agreement with Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">However this was also the reason why we said that a safeguard clause must be more than just a trade clause. It also needs to try to influence certain other things: the issues of human rights and social standards, as well as environmental aspects. Some legal opinions state that such things have no place in a safeguard clause. I believe, however, that they do have a place here and must be included, because such a clause, as Mr Lange has already explained, will protect European jobs and social standards. In order to achieve this, social standards, human rights and work conditions must also be improved in our partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the big question that divides us from many of our colleagues is to what extent these influences should be permitted, representing as they do attempts to intervene in other countries through trade policy. We cannot use trade policy as a way to coerce the governments of other countries into action. At best we can try to influence these governments so that they move in the direction we consider to be correct. That is what we have attempted to do. Of course, people differ on how far this should go. The result is a compromise. I believe it is an acceptable compromise. That is why I also believe that it makes sense to adopt these safeguard clauses tomorrow. Discussion of the nuts and bolts of the agreement will be more intensive in some areas. With regard to safeguard clauses, however, it must be seen that these are just safeguard clauses and not an entire agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, dear colleagues, first of all, allow me to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Lange and Mr Leichtfried for the work they did on these files.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank you for the opportunity to clarify outstanding issues regarding the adoption of the Bilateral Safeguard Regulations in the context of the agreements with Colombia and Peru and with Central America. As you know, these agreements were signed in June, and Parliament will soon take a decision on them via an assent procedure. But before I go on to explain the importance of adopting these safeguard regulations, let me first once again underline the significance of these agreements for the EU and for these two Latin American regions.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements, between the EU and Colombia and Peru, and between the EU and Central America, will fundamentally change and upgrade the relationship between the EU and these two regions. On the trade side, the agreements aim at opening markets for goods, services, government procurement and investment. Tariffs in industrial and fisheries products will be fully eliminated on both sides, while trade in agricultural products will be considerably enhanced by substantial tariff concessions. In addition, the agreements will establish a set of predictable and enforceable trade rules which in many instances go further than the commitments taken in the framework of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, together with your report, these agreements will give us an improved, stable, predictable and enforceable set of trading conditions under which economic operators from the EU, Colombia, Peru and Central America will be able to take full advantage of the emerging complementarities between our respective economies. Beyond pure trade flows, let me remind you that these agreements will also improve far-reaching provisions guaranteeing the protection of human rights as well as commitments on labour rights and environmental protection and will foster the promotion of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now move to the specific question of the adoption of the Bilateral Safeguard Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of these regulations is to provide a safety net for the Union’s industry in case the tariff liberalisation results in an injurious surge of imports. We need them in order to implement the safeguard provisions of the agreements. The Commission welcomes the principle adopted by the rapporteurs when examining the Commission proposal and drafting the amendments, namely of following the model of Korea as closely as the specificities of the agreements allow.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a consensus that the implementing regulations cannot be in conflict with the commitments undertaken in the agreements and WTO provisions. Here it is important not to lose focus. This parliamentary debate on the safeguard regulations is very important, but it should not serve as a framework to re-open questions that have already been addressed, such as the need to make these agreements conditional on respect for human and social rights. As you know, these issues are already covered by the agreements, and in its June 2012 resolution, Parliament already clearly expressed the political line to follow and the need for Colombia and Peru to present a roadmap on human labour and environmental rights. The Commission has taken due note of this resolution and is actively working with these countries on it.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me express my wish that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will enjoy good cooperation in the trialogues that will soon begin so that all the conditions will soon be met for Parliament to take a decision on these agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The negotiated safeguard clauses have been improved and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas has been strengthened. There will be greater transparency and exhaustive monitoring of banana imports into the European Union with prior surveillance measures.</p>

Those agreements are essential for the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These clauses, along with the progress made by Colombia, acknowledged by the political resolution adopted by this House on 13 June, as well as the support of the Central American countries and Peru for this regulation, should provide the final approval for the ratification of those agreements. These clauses will allow our producers to progressively adapt to a free-trade framework that will benefit us all.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the United States and Asian countries are signing free-trade agreements with American countries, such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) or the agreements between the United States and Colombia and Peru, respectively, we cannot allow the leading trading power in the world, the European Union, to continue to miss opportunities.

<p class="contents">As with all trade agreements, we need to ensure that by opening our markets we allow European companies and producers time to adapt to increased competition.

<p class="contents">We need to give the Commission the flexibility to decide, for example, if a surge in banana imports from Colombia or Costa Rica is harming EU banana producers or if it is simply compensating for reduced production in other parts of the world.

They are not. These clauses have nothing to do with ‘safeguard’ except the name. Unless the plan is to safeguard wholesale agreements that neither the Commission nor the signatory Member States are prepared to question and do not want to change. These agreements, as you know – and Mr Mato Adrover has reminded you – are very detrimental to the banana industries of the outermost regions. After all, the mechanisms that activate these banana clauses are such as to become inoperable, almost virtual. However, we are now being asked to applaud the illusion of production!</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these clauses, the banana industries of the West Indies have been left at the mercy of unfair competition from the exporting industries of Latin America and the blind trade liberalisation that the Commission wishes to impose. I therefore call on my colleagues to vote in favour of the amendments I have tabled, which provide minimum protection for the banana industries of the outermost regions and the jobs that depend on them.</p>

We have presented amendments to protect European production, in accordance with the Treaties, and to establish safety mechanisms for both European production and production in the countries where the agreement applies.</p>
<p class="contents">The outermost regions need protection given the lack of diversification of crops and the economic aspect, as a large number of jobs are affected – over 10 000 direct jobs and 35 000 indirect jobs in Spain, in a population that has been suffering unemployment – and because of their specific nature. Bananas in the Canary Islands, for example, have a very specific place in agriculture, culture and gastronomy.</p>

<p class="contents">I will try to give an answer to some specific questions that have been put to me, although not all of them refer to the safeguard mechanism. I was asked where we stand regarding the human, labour and environmental roadmap that the European Parliament requested from Colombia and Peru in its June 2012 resolution. I am fully aware of the importance that you, the European Parliament, attach to this roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest information I have is that Colombia has already presented some preliminary information to the rapporteur for the trade agreement, Mário David, and the rapporteur for the present regulatory safeguards, Bernd Lange, which shows that the country is taking this exercise very seriously. They should be able to present a full roadmap proposal by early October. I also understand that the Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister is to meet Mr Lange to present his country’s plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We have less information on where Peru stands, but the Commission is in regular contact with them to underline the fundamental importance of this exercise. I understand that Parliament is also in contact with the Peruvian authorities via your rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the banana stabilisation mechanism, which would not provide enough protection for the outermost regions, let me make a few remarks. I know that the outermost regions are especially vulnerable to a sudden increase in imports. That is the reason why we have negotiated specific conditions in order to safeguard their interests. These conditions reflect their particular situation and are based on a model we have previously used. This seems to have given them full reassurance in the past and I trust this will be the case here as well. The special safeguard for the outermost regions will still apply after the transition period has expired, which means after the banana mechanism has been discontinued.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also some remarks on how to put it into practice. There I believe it is good practice that the Commission has a margin of appreciation. You could have substitution for example, as was mentioned in the debate, but we take these things very seriously. It is not only on bananas that we could get these kinds of safeguard requests from Member States. For example France has recently made a request to monitor car exports from Korea into the European market. That is a first step in the safeguard that we would obtain by monitoring. If we get such a question we duly research it and only take a decision after having considered all elements of the file. So we are very serious about this, not only where the major economic interests of the European Union are concerned. For example this concerns the economic interests of the outer regions. We will be very scrupulous in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning briefly to the access to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, I need to be frank with you on the issue of compensation. It is unprecedented for the outcome of the international trade negotiations to be compensated as far as the lost market shares for individual products and farmers are concerned, but I would like to recall that the Commission has made a proposal regarding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which the co-legislators are called to decide upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission has already examined the consequences of tariff liberalisation comparable to the tariff cuts in the current banana agreement in the context of the reform of the banana common market organisation in 2006. To reflect that, the budgetary allocation for the banana producers in the EU was substantially increased. It would be unsustainable and politically difficult to justify a further increase in the support for the banana producers. The banana producers in the outer regions are the most supported producers in the whole European Union. I can only reiterate that the banana reform, with integration into POSEI, has already included compensation of up to EUR 279 million per year, also for the expected future FTA trade deals, including the ones for Colombia, Peru and Central America. You will agree with me that this is quite a lot of money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
