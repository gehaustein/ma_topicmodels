<p class="contents">The European Parliament attaches great importance to relations with Lebanon. Some of the European Union’s Member States have contributed military personnel to UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Lebanon is also one of the few Arab states which have accepted a European Union election observation mission. This is very important to us. Parliament is actively involved in missions of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries provides an institutional framework for political dialogue between our parliaments. I warmly encourage our three visitors to maintain this dialogue by regular contacts. I hope that the meetings held yesterday and today were fruitful and that the visit to Brussels of our guests from the Lebanese Parliament will actively contribute to closer relations between our institutions. Thank you once again for coming to Europe and for coming to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – I would like to make two further statements. Firstly, information from the South. The unfolding of events in the countries of our Southern Neighbourhood is a source of both hopes and fears. We are going to talk about this today. We welcome the gradual stabilisation of the situation in Libya. Fears are being aroused, however, by the humanitarian situation facing refugees and displaced persons. Tunisia today is moving steadily towards its first truly free elections. I am planning to visit both of these countries – Libya and Tunisia – in the next few weeks, where I will present the European Parliament’s position on democratic progress, the creation of a free market and future neighbourly cooperation between the European Union and Libya and Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence in Egypt must be stopped, and the military authorities, instead of escalating tension, have a duty to help exercise restraint and to guarantee the security of members of religious minorities there. We would like to appeal very strongly for this to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In Syria and Yemen, the regimes continue to respond with violence to the citizens’ demands. We must constantly appeal to the European Union’s Member States and the international community to oppose the brutal repression and to support the opposition movement for democratic change in both these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, news from the East. It was with great regret that we received news of the sentence of seven years in prison handed down to Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Prime Minister of Ukraine. We are afraid that this sentence is politically motivated and shows that the law is being applied selectively in Ukraine. Our concern has also been aroused over the independence and transparency of the trial. Strengthening the rule of law and the real independence of the judiciary are conditions which are essential for the eventual signing of the association agreement at the end of this year. I call on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that the principles and values which define our mutual relations are given practical expression in the spirit of a true Eastern Partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title5"></a><a name="creitem5"></a>

It includes a debate on the situation in Yemen and Bahrain, which has been extended to cover Syria and Egypt. These issues are very important, but they concern states over which we have no direct influence. The fact is, Mr President, Member States’ armed forces, under NATO control, are today continuing to kill, in our name, the last remaining supporters of the former regime in Libya. This is a far cry from the mandate that was granted by the United Nations. I have no idea how many victims Europe’s bombs have currently claimed in Sirte or in the surrounding areas, and I feel that we should address this issue. We are more than just the weapon bearers of NATO and the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mikołaj Dowgielewicz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, I come to Parliament almost straight from the discussion in Luxembourg yesterday at the General Affairs Council, where we also discussed with President Van Rompuy how we should prepare this important European Council. It will be a very important European Council that should take major audacious decisions that will protect Europe, the euro, the citizens and our economy from the shocks that are around.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say at the outset that the decision of the President of the European Council to delay the meeting by six days is, I think, a good decision that has been welcomed by the Member States, because it will give us more time to prepare a package of decisions that the citizens and the markets are waiting for.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that, despite some signals you may have heard about the process of ratification of the EFSF by the Member States, the Polish Presidency wants to express full confidence that we will have ratification completed on time by all the Member States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The next meeting of the European Council will once again be mainly dedicated to economic issues. As you all know, the economic situation is worsening with a slowing down in growth, and a continued impact of the sovereign debt risks in certain countries. In this difficult context, it is essential to intensify efforts to secure sustainable and job-creating growth, to ensure the sustainability of public finances and restore confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me go through some of the main issues on the European Council agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, economic policy. The European Council will discuss a number of key priorities which should be fast-tracked because of their significant impact on jobs and growth in the short to medium term. It will also call for stronger focus to be given to the growth-enhancing aspects of the European Union’s external policies in order to maximise their contribution to growth in Europe and to shape the conditions to attract more foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that we will discuss is the G20. The European Council will set out the Union’s position for the upcoming summit in Cannes, giving top priority to maintaining financial stability and restoring growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The third item will be climate change, and I am pleased to say that the Environment Council agreed conclusions on Monday that will put the European Union once again in the lead ahead of the climate conference in Durban in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding economic policy, in the light of the Commission’s report on the growth-enhancing areas and the political conference that the Presidency and the Commission co-organised on 6 October, the European Council will identify a number of key priorities for internal economic policy that will have a significant impact on jobs and growth in the short to medium term. Economic policy in the European Union cannot be just about fiscal consolidation, discipline and austerity, much as we all need those words. We also need growth to boost the confidence of citizens too in the European project. This is why the Polish Presidency is giving such a high priority to the growth-enhancing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will set specific timelines for the implementation of some of those key priorities, namely, the 12 priority proposals foreseen in the Single Market Act on which agreement should be reached by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those priorities, utmost priority will be given to those which can bring the most benefits for growth and jobs, notably, finalisation of the unitary patent protection system in Europe, modernisation of the Professional Qualifications Directive, promotion of SME access to finance, modernisation and simplification of the legislative framework for EU public procurement, promotion of green development, in particular, through energy efficiency, and the rapid adoption of the standardisation regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, full implementation of the Services Directive will also deliver significant economic gains. Member States will be called to complete the implementation by the end of this year and show that the points of single contact are operational.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, measures to promote a fully integrated digital single market through the facilitation of e-commerce and the cross-border use of online services, including the instrument on European contract law, the so-called ‘Blue Button’.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, reduction of administrative and regulatory burden. As regards the administrative burden, momentum should be maintained in implementing the 2007 action plan in order to meet the objective of a 25% reduction by 2012. The rapid adoption of the simplification proposals pending before the Council and Parliament is essential to being able to meet this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the regulatory burden, further efforts are needed to reduce the overall regulatory burden, in particular, for SMEs, including by proposing concrete working methods within the context of the smart regulation agenda. The European Council looks forward to the Commission’s forthcoming report in order to return to those issues at its December 2011 meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards budgetary and structural reforms, Member States will be called to continue to ensure that the country-specific recommendations are fully reflected in national decisions, particularly as regards those which are of crucial importance for creating jobs and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding economic governance, the EU now has powerful tools to ensure that the measures required are taken to pull Europe out of the crisis: the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Semester, the Euro Plus Pact, and the package of the six legislative proposals recently agreed on economic governance. And here I want to stress that the so-called six-pack must be rigorously and timely implemented in a most serious fashion by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Council will discuss the external aspects of the Union’s economic policy in conjunction with the preparations for the summits which will be taking place in the autumn as part of the follow-up to its September 2010 conclusions on strategic partnership. The intention is to adopt a thematic approach to this exercise with a focus on efforts to promote Europe’s competitiveness in the world. This covers potential issues such as trade, access to raw materials, investment treaties, public procurement and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, on the G20: the European Union considers that the G20 should send a strong message of confidence at the Cannes Summit through an ambitious action plan with concrete commitments and measures from all G20 countries to respond to the challenges emanating from the current slowdown and to ensure strong, sustainable and balanced growth, while implementing credible fiscal consolidation. In this context, I just want to recall that the main orientations for the EU position were discussed by the Finance, Agriculture, Employment, Development and General Affairs Councils and they form the basis for the discussion in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, the EU position is based on the following EU priorities: restoring growth and tackling global macro-economic imbalances, making tangible progress on implementing the financial market reform agenda, making the international monetary system more resilient, boosting trade as the most effective way to support global growth, enhancing the social dimension of globalisation, ensuring food security and promoting the G20 development agenda and innovative financing, the need for the G20 to further tackle the global climate and energy challenges and continue the fight against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on climate change, I just want to say that the European Union will work towards an ambitious and balanced outcome at the Durban conference, building up on what was agreed last year in Cancún. It is urgent to address the issue of the second commitment period on the Kyoto Protocol and agree on a process towards a legally binding framework by a clear timeline, ensuring global participation, including from major economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that the Polish Presidency, together with the President of the European Council and the Commission, stands ready to make sure that this summit will be a success. We are also considering two additional meetings of the Council formations, notably, Ecofin and the General Affairs Council, just before the European Council, before 23 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the European Council of 23 October will be held against a backdrop of urgency over the threat of systemic crisis now unfolding. There are many issues on the European agenda: the Minister of the Polish Presidency mentioned most of them. I will not speak in detail about many of the important challenges, from the conference in Durban to very important external items. I will focus today on the most urgent response to the financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">To break the vicious cycle of uncertainty over sovereign debt sustainability and over growth prospects, we need comprehensive solutions now. In my State of the Union address to this Parliament two weeks ago, I promised responses. Today we are delivering: I can announce that the Commission has just adopted a road map for stability and growth. And we have set out concrete terms and timelines for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are the first to whom I have communicated the main elements of this road map. I am sending the President of Parliament the document that we have just adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last three years, the European Union has come out with specific responses to different aspects of the crisis. Now it is time to bring them all together, to once and for all meet the depth of the crisis with a full, comprehensive, credible response.</p>
<p class="contents">The elements in this road map are interdependent. They must be implemented simultaneously. They must be implemented immediately. This is the only way that the European Union can, convincingly: first, give a decisive clear response to the problems of Greece; second, enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis; third, make a coordinated effort to strengthen the banking system, including through recapitalisation; fourth, frontload stability and growth-enhancing policies; and finally, build a more robust and integrated economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the five points of our road map, the road map I put before this House today, and that I will take to the European Council on 23 October as a coherent and comprehensive plan for Europe that embodies a Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on Greece, we need a decisive solution. Doubts and uncertainties over Greece’s future jeopardise stability in the entire euro area and beyond. The time has come to definitively remove these doubts. This means three immediate and sustained actions. First, paying the sixth tranche of the loans to Greece. The result of the Troika mission has sent a positive signal in this respect. Second, deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area. This should be through an effective second adjustment programme, based on adequate financing through public and private sector involvement, backed up with robust implementation and monitoring mechanisms. Third, we also understand that Greece must fully carry out its programme in a timely manner, with continued support from the Commission’s Task Force and maximised disbursement of Structural Funds focused on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a more general problem in the euro area. Despite the assurance given by Heads of State or Government on 21 July to support countries under programmes, and despite their assurances that private sector involvement would be strictly limited to Greece, contagion risks have not been contained. To decisively put a stop to this threat that is hampering all our efforts, we must strengthen the euro’s firewalls. We must have credible, stronger instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Council, I will strongly urge the Heads of State or Government of the euro area to complete and complement the measures they agreed on 21 July. This is crucial, to give a much-needed injection of confidence to market participants.</p>
<p class="contents">It means making operational the agreements taken to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF and the future ESM, to allow for precautionary programmes based on conditionality, on which the Commission and the ECB should be consulted in advance. Stronger monitoring and surveillance could be included as part of the Stability and Growth Pact. But the EFSF must be more than just a firewall. It should have real firepower. We should maximise its capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">To further consolidate the expression of unity and responsibility inherent in these crisis resolution mechanisms, we must accelerate the adoption and entry into force of the permanent ESM – preferably to mid-2012. We must trust that the European Central Bank will continue to provide the background of financial stability needed for all this to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthened and more flexible EFSF is in the interest of all euro countries, including, I am sure, the Slovak people. Our common currency plays a crucial role in investment decisions, in growth, in jobs all over Europe. I commend those in Slovakia who have risen above partisan attitudes and voted in favour of what is important for all Slovak citizens, for the euro area and for the European Union as a whole. And I call upon all parties in the Slovak Parliament to rise above the positioning of short-term politics and to seize the next opportunity to ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The third element of the road map is the need for a coordinated approach to strengthen the banking system. Let us be clear – over the last three years, huge efforts have been deployed to this end; billions of euro in aid and guarantees; an overhaul of banking supervision, boosting capital requirements and protecting citizens’ deposits.</p>
<p class="contents">However, all this has not yet been sufficient to lift the weight of uncertainty hanging over the banking system, or to halt the volatility and pressure on European banks. While these doubts persist and spread, sufficient confidence cannot be restored to allow liquidity to flow again and to oil the growth that our economies so badly need. For confidence to return, we need to fix the sovereign debt problem, which can only be done through a coherent package.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore urgently strengthen the banks because, in fact, those two issues – the sovereign contagion and the banks – are now, whether we like it or not, linked. This must be coordinated through the Member States, the European Banking Authority, the ECB and the Commission. The strategy should comprise five key steps. It should include all potentially systemic banks identified by the European Banking Authority across all Member States. It should take account of all sovereign debt exposure in full transparency; it should involve a temporarily higher capital ratio after accounting for exposure. Banks that do not have the required capital should present and then implement plans to have it in place as swiftly as possible and, until they have done so, they should be prevented from paying out dividends and bonuses by the national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Banks should use private sources of capital first. If necessary, the national governments should provide support as a next step, as a last resort, drawing on a loan granted from the EFSF. Any public support should be compatible with the State aid rules. The Commission intends to extend the existing State aid framework for bank support beyond the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, details on capital ratios and evaluation methods should be proposed by the EBA with national supervisors, who are best placed to judge on this. At the same time, the ongoing work on a new financial regulation system should be completed as swiftly as possible. To that end, the Commission will present its remaining proposals to implement the full G20 commitments by the end of this year. We also urge rapid adoption of the financial transaction tax I presented to you two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fourth element is to frontload policies that consolidate stability and boost growth. We all know that most Member States do not have much room for fiscal stimulus. Those who do should use it. However, all Member States have at their disposal the means to implement structural reforms, to focus spending on priority areas, and to remove obstacles to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to you in my State of the Union address, growth is within our reach if we can break down the barriers that stop money, services and people from flowing through our Union as they should.</p>
<p class="contents">This means firstly: getting more out of what has already been agreed at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about implementing, for instance, the Services Directive. I am talking about delivering on the digital agenda. I am talking about maximising our trade agreements. These are measures that we can take today, that do not require significant additional investment or budgetary effort, but which can have an immediate and significant benefit for our companies, for our citizens and for our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This means secondly: accelerating adoption of what is on the table. There are many proposals on the table that we can fast-track for adoption. I am talking about unitary patent protection. I am talking about the Energy Savings Directive. I am talking about concluding ongoing trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">This means thirdly: fast-tracking the most urgent growth boosting proposals. I am talking about the Single Market Act. I am talking about forthcoming proposals to facilitate access to venture capital because, today, there is a lack of venture capital in Europe and this is especially felt by SMEs. I am talking about the Young Opportunities initiative to increase youth employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Where agreement on fast-tracking proves difficult, we should be able to use enhanced cooperation so that those who want to move forward are not held back. Frankly, dear Members of this Parliament, it is time to say that the speed of the European Union should not always be the speed of its slowest member. We need sometimes to use reinforced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All this should be done in conjunction with targeted investment at European Union level, such as through the Europe 2020 Agenda, where we propose also our project bond initiative. The Commission will propose it next week, and will maximise the resources of the European Investment Bank so that it can lend to the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">So, reforms, implementation of everything that we have agreed, as well as trying to fund some of this effort through new sources of investment, using the appropriate instruments we have and some we can create, such as the project bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth and final element of the Commission’s proposed road map is the pursuit of sound economic policies by Member States, especially those in the euro area, reinforced by stronger Community governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the six-pack – and once again I thank you for your support in getting these ambitious proposals approved. We have the European Semester and all that it entails in strengthening governance. But we must go further to match the ambitions of our monetary policy with those of our economic policies. As we have said, we must complete the monetary union with a real economic union. The future of the single currency depends upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">In its road map, the Commission is proposing a much stronger euro area dimension in planning, implementing and assessing national policies. This dimension will be backed up by strict constraints enforceable at euro area level and is based on an enhancement of the Community approach, which will reinforce also Parliament’s role in economic governance. We will further reinforce the role of the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs in full respect of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other actions we can take very quickly without changing the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve working methods and crisis management between the Commission, the European Council and the Euro Group. Proposals to this end will be made soon, in line with the agreements of 21 July, by the President of the European Council, the Commission President and the President of the Euro Group, and the aim is to have a more streamlined process between the euro area summit, the Euro Group and the euro area working group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should streamline and reinforce the instruments we have, not only by rapidly implementing the six-pack, but also by strengthening the European Semester by intensifying surveillance and integrating the Euro Plus Pact into the Semester – hence reinforcing the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also go further than the measures set out in the six-pack, by setting out provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of euro area Member States requesting or receiving financial assistance from the EFSF, the ESM or other institutions. The Commission will make a proposal to the Council and to the Parliament under Article 136.</p>
<p class="contents">We must monitor the national budgetary policies of Member States in excessive deficit procedure or countries under programmes through a Commission-Council procedure which would enable the European Union to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in serious cases, a second reading of draft budgets could be requested to suggest amendments in the course of the year and to monitor budgetary execution. The Commission will make a proposal to the Council and Parliament under Article 136 setting out the graduated steps and conditions that should apply in such cases. You see that we are really speaking seriously when we mention the need for more discipline, more integration. It means more euro, more Europe. That I think should be the goal of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All this is in addition to the proposals on a more unified external representation for the euro area and options for ‘stability bonds’ that the Commission will bring forward by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point on governance: in the State of the Union address, I said that the Commission would present a single, coherent framework for better economic governance based on the Community method. We are developing that right now.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will ensure compatibility between the euro area and the Union as a whole. It will be done in a way that aims to integrate the Euro Plus Pact, because coordination and integration must be carried out at a single, Community level. How can we talk about coordination and integration in a disintegrated manner? It is obvious that we need a Community approach to do that. Yes, we need stronger governance. Yes, we need the euro area Heads of Government to meet more frequently. But no, we do not need to create yet more institutions or yet more titles, when we already have the structures in place to do the job.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we do not create a division between the 17 members of the euro area and the 27 Members of the European Union, most of whom wish to join the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Such a division could deeply harm the European Union as a whole. It could call into question the single market or be an invitation to renationalisation of Community policies. That is why we need to have stronger governance for the countries that are in the euro area, but to have it in full compatibility with the rules and the <span class="italic">acquis</span> for the European Union as a whole. This is why it is essential to keep the Community institutions – Parliament, the Commission – at the very core of the process of coordination and integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of these institutions is also to guarantee this link, to guarantee that no Member State is jeopardised, to guarantee that Europe remains strong and united.</p>
<p class="contents">The solutions to Europe’s crisis are, I believe, known to most of us, but it requires courage and political will to grasp them. To do so is to fully acknowledge our interdependence and to take a bold leap towards further integration. The problem of Europe is not too much integration; it is, in fact, the lack of a European approach.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Such changes to the nature of our Union may need to be enshrined in changes to the Treaty; changes that must keep the Community method at their core.</p>
<p class="contents">But one thing is for sure – as the crisis narrows in on us, I see no other option than to act now. So the fact that we are considering more ambitious changes for the future should not be an excuse not to take the decisions now and this is why we need to act together in a unified and coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis is not partial. The response cannot be partial. Our responses cannot be piecemeal. That is why this road map is a single, comprehensive approach and all its elements must be implemented in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message I intend to take to the European Council on 23 October and for which I would like to have your support, the support for a united and stronger Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, a resolution will be adopted, tomorrow, by an overwhelming majority of MEPs, calling on the Heads of State or Government to show a sense of responsibility when they meet on 23 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of my colleagues who are present, I sometimes feel as though I am repeating myself and taking part in a discussion between the institutions and our Member States in which everyone is talking at cross purposes. Yes, we agree on the significance of the crisis, on the urgent need to come up with solutions, and on the vital mix of deficit reduction measures and measures to boost growth and employment, but we differ as to the measures that need to be taken and whether those measures should be taken piecemeal or with surgical precision.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must stop debating the ways in which it could possibly take its decisions and whether or not it should embark upon yet another reform of the Treaties. Europe must stop analysing, weighing things up and, above all, hesitating. Europe must act; Europe must put a stop to the debate about solidarity with Greece. Of course it must show solidarity, and the decision taken by the Troika yesterday was just as responsible as the political point-scoring episode in the Slovak Parliament was irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must stop questioning whether or not we should cut our public deficits. Of course we should tackle public deficits at national and regional level! It is just a question of knowing how to do so and of making sure that any action we take is completely fair from a fiscal and social point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, I am not going to read the text that I prepared for the Commission. I am simply going to congratulate you and tell you that I agree with what you have said today and that I am behind it. The only thing I would add is that I wish you luck in getting it past the Council, and you will have the support of our political group. Go for it, do not be afraid. Measures need to be taken before Christmas. Thank you very much, then, for this presentation that you have delivered to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about Europe, I am not just talking about Brussels and Strasbourg. I am also talking about Bratislava, London, and all the European capitals. They must understand that real sovereignty is not just the gilded treasures found in republican or royal palaces. Real sovereignty, ladies and gentlemen, is the ability to give our fellow citizens the life they deserve, the standard of living they work for, and freedom. We will not achieve that by withdrawing behind our national borders, closing the Schengen borders again or bringing back protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth and jobs – although I know that the anti-Europeans do not agree, and I love the fact that they are grumbling, because it means that we are on the right track <span class="italic">(Applause)</span>. Mr Farage, you gave a good example of this at the last Conference of Presidents, and I hope that it will be the same today – growth and jobs, President-in-Office of the Council, will only materialise again in Europe if, as from 23 October, our Member States play the game, the European game, the solidarity game, the game of ‘all for one and one for all’ fully, unconditionally and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say it again, for the third time in my speeches: we need to bring into line tax rates, retirement age and weekly working time, to mention just a few examples. My group has not given me enough time to list everything that is impossible in Europe. However, you know that the word ‘impossible’ is not in the French vocabulary. Therefore, anything is possible, and that is also my party’s slogan. Europe must act, and I am convinced that it will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, we need a response for our fellow citizens. What kinds of questions are we having to answer today in our campaigns? When I listen to people who have worked hard all their lives, who have a savings book, I find that the question they ask is: ‘Are our savings and what we have struggled to acquire throughout our life protected by Europe and the euro?’ Yes, they are protected! Yes! Therefore, that is the response we must give them; that is the guarantee we must confirm to them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a duty, at Heads of State or Government level and in the European institutions, to give them that initial response. As far as everything else is concerned, you are right; we do have the tools, we do have the political means. If we implement them, we will overcome the crisis. Moreover, I should like to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that European countries are not the only ones that are contacting our offices today. We are also being contacted by those who are already worried about whether we are going to succeed and whether the euro, at EUR 1.10 perhaps, is going to revive the European economy in relation to that of other continents, which are beginning to ask themselves questions. As you have said, then, let us take action together, ladies and gentlemen; let us not play cat and mouse, but let us be bold. I am convinced that we are now going to pave the way for our exit from the crisis, for Europe’s exit from the crisis, so that we can restore it to its place in the world in which we want to live.</p>

I can only say that what Mr Barroso has proposed and presented to us – repeatedly – reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of this House. In other words, the Community institutions are moving closer together. That certainly cannot be said of the other side – the side of the government institutions, that is to say, the Council and the European Council, because it is not the case, Mr Daul, that we need solutions by Christmas; we need solutions now. The situation in the European Union is namely so dramatic that we need to do two things at the same time: we need to keep in view the stability of the economic situation in the States of the European Union that are at risk and in those that are still stable, and we must also understand that the Treaty of Lisbon cannot be the end of the road of European integration, but that it is an intermediate step and that we need further communitisation of policy areas, because otherwise we will create another serious democratic deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is absolutely clear that if we leave the decisions on our currency, economic and financial policy, budget policy and fiscal policy in general exclusively to this permanent Vienna Congress, which in this case calls itself the European Council, where those holding power in Europe will travel to Brussels and meet behind closed doors only to then tell the astonished population what they have once again failed to achieve – that cannot be an efficient way for Europe to operate and for it to gain the confidence of the markets and the citizens. This dismembered Europe, where each Head of State or Government is maintaining the tactical equivocations of its national parliamentarians, this Europe will not strengthen the euro. Therefore, we need communitisation. When you cite Article 136 here with the Commission and the Council, Mr President, we as Parliament always want to be involved in future. Whatever executive action is to be carried out in Europe, Parliament wants to be involved. For this reason alone, we need to amend the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘The people are losing faith in their governments’ – that is the headline in the <span class="italic">Handelsblatt</span> today. The governments are confusing the people. It was your fellow party member, Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that, and he is right. Every day there is another idea, but no solutions. Now we have to recapitalise the banks. We also had to recapitalise the banks three years ago. We said then: ‘but in a controlled way and with unbundling’ – as is now the case with regard to Dexia – investment banking and traditional banking must be unbundled. Nothing has happened in three years! We debated the issue of capital reserves on risk capital balance sheets – nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a situation where we have to recapitalise the banks once again three years after the most severe banking crisis, without the necessary regulations having been established in the meantime. This is a situation in which the people really are losing faith, because Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Dowgielewicz, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is absolutely clear: banks are too big to allow them to fail, and individual States are not important enough to save them! That is the reality of the European Union. Ordinary citizens and their state are unimportant; corporate enterprises are everything!</p>
<p class="contents">I will quote you the words of one expert: ‘The reason why people are losing faith in their governments is that they take money from taxpayers and give it to the banks, and the shareholders profit from it. If taxpayers are the ones paying, then they are also shareholders, if you please! The banks have to give a proportion of their profits to the national budget. That is my old fashioned view of the matter’. – said Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg. The President of the Commission says: ‘We need the financial transaction tax’. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are not managing to bring that about. Therefore, we cannot wait until Christmas; we must act now.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to make it very clear: we hope that, on 23 October in the Council, you will also show the courage that you have now shown twice before this House, and then I would have liked you to come back and give us a report. However, I have heard that you will be in China at the EU-China Summit and so cannot come. Mr Van Rompuy will also fly out there with you and so cannot come either. I assume that Mr Tusk will not be able to come either. I do not know what all three of you will tell the Chinese, perhaps it is always the same thing – everything has already been said, just not by everyone. Perhaps you can tell Mr Van Rompuy that he can come, because it should suffice for Mr Tusk and Mr Barroso to be there.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be important, after such an important summit, for the President of the Council to make a statement before the European Parliament so that we will at least know whether the Heads of State or Government are doing their job. We are doing ours, you are doing yours – the Council must now do its job.</p>

Yet why not? It is the presence of a coalition partner that explains such a huge change. They are asking for an economic and fiscal union, Mr Swoboda: that is the big change.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as has been said, the British Government is asking to have a more integrated Europe – and that seems to be what they are asking for – then it is in their interests too. Let us recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, we now have certainty that you will put a global plan before the Council. I presume you will do that by tabling a document at the European Council on 23 October. It would be good if Members of Parliament could also receive a copy of that document in advance so that we can see what aspects of the Commission proposals the European leaders are accepting and what they are still not accepting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I will ask for your attention on three points, where I think you have to reinforce your proposals, and you still have quite some time before 23 October to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that you have to change the rules of the European Financial Stability Facility – because it does not work. A unanimity rule in a rescue system cannot work, as we have learned today in Slovakia and a number of other countries. You need to make it clear not only that a majority voting system is needed but also that the funds for the system must be increased. We have to help Member States in difficulties; we have to recapitalise the banks; we have to help countries that have insufficient liquidity. So you must tell the truth, and the truth is that we have to triple – at least triple – the funds in the EFSF, otherwise it will not be convincing to the financial markets. That is the first point that needs to be made on 23 October: you should tell the Council that you want to change the EFSF, that there should be majority voting, and that the funds must be at least tripled. Then you will have real firepower, and not merely a ‘firewall’ against the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns Eurobonds. We know what the solution will be in the end because what the EFSF will do is to create Eurobonds covered by the European Central Bank – and who do you think is covering the capital of the European Central Bank? The Member States of the eurozone! It is exactly the same system, so come forward with the Green Paper as quickly as possible. A few weeks ago, you said that you would come forward with the Green Paper in a few weeks. A few minutes ago, you said it would be by the end of the year. I know that still means a few weeks, but I am asking you to move as quickly as possible because, in the end, that is the only way to convince the markets that we have created real solidarity and real discipline in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point is recapitalisation of the banks. Mr Barroso, you have indicated a number of aspects of that operation. Our Parliament is asking for a European plan for recapitalisation. Do not make the mistake of 2008 when, at the Elysée Palace on 4 October, some Member States – and Mrs Merkel was involved here – refused a European plan for recapitalisation of the banks. Mrs Merkel thought that no German bank would have to be rescued. A few minutes later, in the car, she received information that there was also a German bank that had difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a European plan and not, as you said earlier, action by the national governments in the first instance. No: it is at European level that we have to decide which banks to help and with what money. The national governments can then come in with money if the EFSF does not have the possibility of doing so, but it has to be a European plan, not a coordination of national plans.

Analysing mistakes is, in my opinion, the best way to make sure we do something better in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall a situation that, for me, was typical of the crisis management of the European Union, particularly the European Council. I will not forget how Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and Baudouin Prot, the chief executive of BNP Paribas, became directly involved in the discussions of the Council at a very decisive moment in July of this year. I believe that – before we move on to the next bank rescue package – we need to agree in general in the European Parliament that we must no longer do this on the basis of erroneous considerations. These grey eminences of capital must not be allowed to determine how we change our regulation of the banking sector. That is my fundamental plea today.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk so loftily in euro jargon of the recapitalisation of the banking sector. In my view, up to now, we have only kept the banks on life-support; we have not really rescued them. In particular, we have still not rescued a single country in the European Union during the crisis of the last few years. Therefore, before we call for the second bank rescue package, we need to ask at what cost we actually want to do this. I firmly believe that these costs should be low, because they will be borne by taxpayers. I believe that we need to link recapitalisation with as comprehensive control of these banks as possible. In Germany, there is talk of intelligent nationalisation. Something like this should be regulated at European level. It needs to be clear that, if we provide the money again, the party has to be over for those who are making money in the banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I have yet to hear anything about a genuine European regulation of the recapitalisation of these banks. Dexia is, for me, a name that is synonymous with the failure of European politics in the banking sector. Dexia passed the stress test without a problem. If I have judged the situation correctly, Dexia would also comply with all the new rules that you have proposed without a problem. Every obstacle posed by the rules that we are now planning for 2013 would be overcome by Dexia. This is a situation, Mr Barroso, that we need to rectify. The same applies to the European Parliament. There needs to be a strict brake on debt for the banks, and this must not wait until 2019. We also need binding liquidity rules, even if it means that we in the European Parliament suddenly find that we do not have the same level of agreement as we would have in a vote on the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the banking sector in Europe look like in the future? In our view, it must be reduced in size. How many troubled large banks can we sustain in the long term? We believe that it is a lot fewer than we currently have. We need to achieve a situation where the banks once again become service providers for the real economy and where they are not the ones that are primarily making profits through speculation. That is also something that we need to decide. Mr Schulz is nodding. I am aware that we are more in agreement on one side of this House than in the House as a whole. Our decision today is all well and good, but there is still much to discuss in terms of the details.</p>

Perhaps the black one will come next.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, however, that the situation is serious, and that you are, in essence, offering nothing different from what the nation states you criticise so much here are offering. You are offering that the European Union jointly redeem those who have too much debt and who have acted irresponsibly, whether banks or entire states, and I say to you that the European economy simply does not have the resources for this. No Eurobond can be large enough to deal with this. When you embark on such a course, you never reach the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are offering a European economic government. You are therefore offering a <span class="italic">de facto</span> liquidation of the nation state and, in my opinion, this can be proposed only by a politician who is completely out of touch with the prevailing mood in the Member States. Look at Finland, look at Slovakia, look at the Netherlands. In my opinion, people are now fed up to the back teeth, Mr President. All we are doing is piling on the pressure, and one day the boiler will explode.</p>
<p class="contents">The only real solution, and the only fair solution, is an economic solution, in other words, handling each case on its own merits, allowing controlled bankruptcies, allowing devaluation and shrinking the euro area, all of which takes courage. It takes courage, Mr President, because the other solution does not require courage. If we cannot muster the courage, ladies and gentlemen, and if the European institutions cannot recover, then this Parliament will be good for only one thing – to sing that Beethoven song, the one they call the European Hymn. We will be good for nothing else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless.</p>
<p class="contents">They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the <span class="italic">indignados</span>, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure many of you here will agree.</p>
<p class="contents">It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination.</p>
<p class="contents">In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme.

<p class="contents">The truth is, you treat the European peoples and their opinion with utter contempt. Recently, the Portuguese changed their government knowing that the austerity policies that the new members of parliament were going to implement would be dictated elsewhere, anyway. The Greek Government cannot even choose the price at which it is going to sell off its state assets: that is decided in Brussels, in Strasbourg, and at the IMF in Washington. Today, Europe’s leaders, and the Commission in particular, have disregarded the Slovak vote and expect the Slovak Parliament to vote again for what they believe is the sensible option, in other words, a vote for ‘ever more Europe’. ‘Ever more Europe’, Mr Verhofstadt, means trebling the European Financial Stability Facility. How far do you want to go, Mr Verhofstadt? 900 billion? 1 200 billion? But where are you going to get the money from?

I have now listened to eight speakers and eight different solutions. That demonstrates the problem that we have here in this House. I am, of course, pleased that there is a more united approach in the Council and that things can be brought together more quickly than the many proposals that we have now heard from the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">If we need to be clear about one thing, however, then it is that we need to make immediate and united efforts to put in order what the Member States have so far prevented us from sorting out. It was easy for the US to establish a European regulation because the country already had institutions at a Federal level. We needed jointly to establish these first, and we have done that together as Parliament, even in the face of opposition, for example, from the United Kingdom. By tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact with the Governance Package, we have shown that we are capable of action here and are able to strengthen Europe to enable it to function.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Barroso, I also have a very strong point of criticism: we cannot now talk about accelerated procedures if we still have no proposals from the Commission for the majority of the necessary regulations. We are waiting for the regulation of financial markets and the Market Abuse Directive to name but two, which will probably not be tabled until next week. We cannot adopt something that is not even on the table! Therefore, my sincere request is for the Commission to press forward with these matters.

We not only have a crisis in the European Union; we also have a crisis in our crisis management or, you could almost say, a crisis in our lack of crisis management. This is a crucial problem. Whenever a summit is held, or at least a summit between Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel, the message which comes out is that the markets will now be reassured. When we adopted the six-pack here in Parliament, it was said that the markets would be reassured. Nothing has happened. We will not be able to bring an end to the crisis without economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have put forward some proposals today and that is a good thing. We will take a careful look at them. I hope that they go further than the suggestions recently made by some Conservative and Liberal prime ministers. We are very much in favour of completing the internal market, but that alone will not generate the necessary growth within the European Union. We need an appropriate concept.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a serious point. Mr Daul is now speaking to his colleague and he is fully entitled to do so. Mr Daul has mentioned Bratislava. What sort of a situation do we currently have in Europe? A government is formed in the full knowledge that some of the coalition partners think and act in an anti-European way. Then, when a crisis occurs, the Social Democrats have to step in to help the government out of it. That is exactly how it is, Mr Ferber. The situation is just the same in the Netherlands. Now a new government is being established in Latvia, where precisely the same thing is happening, because the Latvian Conservatives are saying that they would rather join together with anti-European, right-wing extremists than with voters of Russian origin, who are seen by this new party and the new coalition party as not being true Latvians.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Daul, this is not just about an integrated Europe. It is also about finally having national governments which take a pro-European approach and not governments which come to power and fail when it comes to acting along European lines and then find that they have to turn to the Social Democrats. That is not a proper concept for Europe. We need both things. We need a strong European Union and we also need national governments which think in a European way. That is also important.</p>

We have insisted on this matter. We are therefore rather pleased that things are moving in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, nevertheless, to make two comments. The first concerns the timetable. You have announced measures concerning the banks that I believe are along the right lines, since they would involve the non-payment of dividends to offset measures and so on. Please be aware, however, that some large European banks have already begun to take steps in that direction; <span class="italic">Erste Bank</span> did so the day before yesterday, for example. It would therefore be good if we took action before it is too late, and if the European banking authority that we helped to set up together could offer some guidelines so that the banks are seen for what they are, namely European entities, and if the same rules applied in every country in which they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the question of substance, failing to take action at European level is a problem from the point of view not only of efficiency but also of democracy: how can a handful of politicians – in Slovakia today, but possibly elsewhere tomorrow – representing a very small minority of people being addressed take a decision by themselves and, furthermore, on behalf of the nation, in other words, without giving the others any opportunity to put pressure on those who have to decide? That is why we support a European approach; our need for more Europe is not ideologically motivated. No, we want more Europe for very practical reasons, because our countries, our governments have proved that this does not work. It is ineffective and it is dangerous for democracy. It is therefore in order to tell the European Council this that we are asking you to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one last thing, briefly. You have a knack for using up the leftovers, Mr Barroso. It might be an idea to whet the appetites of investors and citizens with something other than recycled ideas that have already been in the fridge for some time. Project bonds date back to the debate on the State of the Union in 2010, but they have yet to materialise. As for the Single Market Act, I recall that, in 2009, before you were appointed, measures were discussed here before us, and still there is nothing. All of this is along the right lines, but to be perfectly honest, we need to move faster, otherwise we will lose all credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have quite rightly drawn attention to conditionality, which must be linked to this recapitalisation. You said, in any case, that the private sector must be the first to contribute. You said that there should be no more bonuses and no more dividends while this exercise is under way, and you emphasised once again the issue of a tax on financial transactions. I support you on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking you to be consistent. I am asking you to insist that those same conditions are applied to all banks that are still receiving government support today – and there are many of them – but I am also asking you to ensure that they are applied to all banks that fail to meet the new Basel III requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The transition period is very long, much too long. Well, I believe that the conditions that you have set out should be applied for the duration of that transition period. Ultimately, I believe that it is important to tackle the problem at its root, as some people have said today.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have certain expectations of your Commission regarding this infamous casino issue, and it is true that it has disappointed us so far. Today, the derivatives markets are 30 times the size of the real economy. You need to start by isolating this casino, in other words, separate the different types of banking, and then actually close it. This must result in far more ambitious measures regarding the derivatives markets. So far, we have the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, we have the question of credit default swaps, and on that point I feel that your Commission has not demonstrated the ambition that you wish to convey today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Commission is occupying too much of its time with distractions such as the financial transaction tax or with financial services reforms that could dry up liquidity when it is most needed, rather than pursuing the vital competitiveness or deregulation which President Barroso has historically proposed.</p>

The country is facing economic and social devastation resulting from intervention by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. It is obvious that the Greek people can no longer put up with the process of distortion to which they have been subjected. It would be preferable for them to draw the proper lessons while there is still time, and to rein in immediately identical processes already under way in other countries, such as Portugal. If the same steps are taken, the results will inevitably be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, it is the Franco-German directorate making the decisions. National and European governments and authorities heed these decisions. It is obvious who is master and who is servant in this Union. The recapitalisation of the banks, which they are currently preparing, will be another huge transfer of bank debt to the public sector; that is, onto the backs of the workers and the peoples of Europe. The answer to this is organised social struggle that builds and intensifies, as is happening in Portugal, with countless protests, strikes and demonstrations, involving ever more sectors of society.

To do that – as many have said – we need stability and growth. This is a matter for the political will of our leaders. However, if these much desired reforms are not brought in within the next few months, paradoxically, they will become the pretext for eurosceptic criticisms, in which the very same words we use constructively and positively will be used against our project for a united Europe. Unless we act quickly, words such as ‘nation’, ‘people’, ‘identity’ and ‘occupation’ will be thrown back in our faces to attack the feasibility of a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, therefore, Commissioner, to return to the issue previously raised by Mr Ferber of the timescales and methods which the Commission intends to use to present its proposals to Parliament. We give our complete and utter support to the announcements you made earlier during the speech by President Barroso and also in this one. However, when, how and where are you going to detail the nature of your proposals to Parliament? Because if you missed this bus, it would place us in a position where you would lose our support as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem with the eurozone is a problem of political credibility more than economic fundamentals. The financial markets are nervous because they doubt the ability of Europe’s leaders to take action. There are two problems with Europe’s response to the crisis: first, it has always been too little, too late. Europe’s problems need a European solution, and piecemeal national approaches will not do the trick.</p>
<p class="contents">The second has been a lack of strategy for growth. The markets understand that there is no route out of deficit and debt without a credible growth strategy, and the failure of Europe’s leaders has been to act as though fiscal austerity alone is a solution. But without demand, there is no growth; without growth, there is no return to sound finances. That is why the resolution – which I believe Parliament will adopt overwhelmingly tomorrow – insists on a meaningful plan for investment, growth and jobs. Council must also produce a clear response to two other urgent issues: the Greek situation and the recapitalisation of the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">On Greece: the Papandreou Government has displayed enormous courage and commitment in driving through huge painful changes. Greece now has a right to expect solidarity from the EU without further delay. The Council must now give final improvement to the long awaited package of support.</p>
<p class="contents">On bank recapitalisation: our message is ‘yes’, we need decisive and coordinated European action to ensure the security of Europe’s banks, but we say ‘no’ to an unconditional bail-out. As others have said: if public money rescues the banks, the growth and employment imperatives must be fully reflected in the conditions set. One condition must be a clear commitment from the banks to boost lending to the real, productive economy. Public funds must not finance excessive remuneration and speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point: if the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) had been established under Community rules, we could now be agreeing expanding EFSF lending capacity instead of still trying to implement a decision made three months ago. We need a European answer to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The chair of our group has only just requested the documents that describe the proposals in detail and here they are. We have asked for the documents because I would like to reassure myself that I have correctly understood one point which is particularly important to me. The Commission proposals, which, on the whole, are excellent and far-reaching, include the following statement: </p>
<p class="contents">Deciding a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, through an effective second adjustment programme. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> We need a lasting solution for Greece within the euro area and we can achieve this by making Greece’s debts sustainable. In other words, this is the famous haircut. It is insolvency or, if you prefer, ‘re-solvency’. That was precisely our position. This is why we were accused of being populists a few weeks ago when we said that debt reduction would be needed to allow Greece to emerge from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is rightly combining this with robust implementation and supervision mechanisms. This is the right thing to do. We want solidarity, we want to keep Greece in the euro area, but we also want solidity and we want to be able to monitor it, because solidarity cannot be a one-way street. That is extremely important to us. I am pleased that the European debate is now moving in this direction. I am also pleased that our position, which all the experts have long since confirmed is the right one, is now also being confirmed in the political arena.</p>
<p class="contents">I always get a warm feeling when I hear the Tory Members of this House, like Mr Kirkhope, calling for strong European solutions to recapitalise the banks. Issues like national sovereignty and the United Kingdom and its special position always come to mind in these circumstances. However, I am pleased that there are occasions when even London believes that Europe is useful. I would just like to see this happening more often.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final point to make, which is that the news agencies are already reporting that the opposition and the governing parties in Slovakia have agreed to support the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the increase in its scope. This also pleases me. The spectacle of the last few days clearly shows that the requirement for unanimity is a means of setting up blockades. We need majority decisions, including when it comes to stabilising the euro.</p>

No, the solidarity between the Member States of the European Union and of the euro area makes various demands on us and on our voters. However, we are prepared to meet those demands because we want a stability union for Europe and, within this stability union, solidarity is a two-way street. This means that we are prepared to take on these guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of the banks is concerned, I am unhappy about the developments in the banking sector, just as everyone who takes a close look at it is. It is true that some of the things which were being done before the crisis are still going on now. However, one thing is absolutely clear. Without a functioning banking sector, we cannot develop a strategy for growth in Europe. As a result, the actions that we have just taken – paying the next tranche to Greece and organising a haircut which does not completely cripple the banking sector – are necessary to allow us to emerge from the crisis by means of economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people in Europe want someone, in the next Council meeting, to state clearly that this is not about ‘drip loans’, impossible time limits or deadlines postponed indefinitely, but rather that what needs to be done must be done right now: a new strategy to boost growth, employment and productive investment in order to lift Europe out of this rut that has left the European people in a desperate situation, the likes of which have not been seen since the European project was launched more than 50 years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union and the bourgeois governments are united on one thing and one thing only: the strategic choice to unleash a flood of new anti-labour measures, to abolish collective agreements, to slash wages and pensions and to decimate grassroots incomes and labour rights everywhere, in all the Member States, in order to guarantee rising profits for the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of reviewing the agreement of 21 July and the efforts to achieve a new, equally fragile and shaky compromise mark the start of even more drastic hardship for the people. The controlled bankruptcy of Greece being engineered by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, together with the PASOK government and other bourgeois governments of the Member States, whatever you choose to call them, together with the haircuts, debt restructurings and selective bankruptcies, have been on the cards for two years. This is what the capitalist crisis has come to.</p>
<p class="contents">What is of paramount importance is that this is already happening and is exacerbating the uncontrolled bankruptcy of the Greek people.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Portugal and Ireland are on the verge of bankruptcy and other Member States of the European Union will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The general strike being organised by the Working and Grassroots Movement on 19 October in the public and private sectors in Greece will be a general political statement against the entire anti-labour policy of the European Union. It will mark the start of a new class and labour counterattack, an escalation in the fight for a shift in the balance of power and a reversal in the anti-labour measures and overall anti-grassroots policy of the European Union. A popular alliance is needed in order to bring about a different growth model for the benefit of the people, to write off the debts, and to break free from the European Union and give power and the economy back to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only hope that the market will see things differently. After all, there are truly important questions awaiting a definitive, reassuring Community response from this summit. One such question is the recapitalisation of the banks, although this is only acceptable as far as it is necessary in order to revitalise the internal market. Commissioner, the capital injections provided to the banks up to now have not achieved this. Of course it is also relevant to ask to what extent bank recapitalisation is actually aid in disguise. There may be potential that can be exploited in the EU internal market, but to ensure a balance will involve treading a very fine line indeed. Condemning some on the grounds of receiving hidden State aid, while actually handing out State aid to others under the guise of various legal entitlements, would not only distort competition; it would upset the entire system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to launch a EUR 40 billion bond purchasing programme before the year is out. This is good news. It would be very risky, however, if these purchases can be conducted in secondary as well as primary markets. Giving the banks unlimited liquidity for a period of more than a year also carries unforeseeable risks. If this is, in fact, what happens, then the European Financial Stability Facility currently taking shape under the banner of solidarity is based on false premises. I sincerely hope that the delay, the change of date, will be worth it, and that the Council will indeed be able to approve a comprehensive strategy at its summit on 23 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because the Commission has made a commitment here to use its power of initiative, and to do so in conjunction with the Council, in order to resolve this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a hugely important step, and that it is the only means we currently have of resolving the crisis in the euro area. There is no chance of resolving it in the short term merely with an intergovernmental approach, and so it is necessary for the Member States and their governments to give the Commission the instruments and the mandate for it to lead this resolution process, and to put into practice, implement and develop the road map that it has presented here. However, I am bound to say that this is not incompatible with our creating, with our developing an ability to amend the Treaties, at the same time. I, too, am convinced that the Treaties need to be changed in the medium term, but we will also have to do this in the sense of strengthening them and giving greater power and stature to the Commission. By stepping up the Community method now, in the short term, and by subsequently changing the Treaties, in the long term, we will achieve more integration and a solution for the 17 countries of the euro area and the 27 countries of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least this contribution has added value, though. Economic governance will not improve without democratic oversight, without democratic legitimacy. Do not forget that, at EU level, what goes on in the Council must be overseen by this House and that the ordinary legislative procedure ought perhaps to be considered within the scope of the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on, I should like, if I may, to put some questions to you as the representative of your President, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. Mr Barroso came here to deliver a speech to us on the State of the Union, which he hailed as probably one of his greatest speeches. Then, three days later, having denounced the role of the G20, he accepted instructions from a capital to apply macro-economic conditionality to the Structural Funds. Put simply, the regions, the poor and workers are being made to pay for what the capitals have been unable to implement. Do you consider that to be an example of good European governance?</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 July, when you and the Heads of State or Government adopted the second bailout plan for Greece, you said that we needed a pillar to support economic activity, and you used the Structural Funds for that purpose.

We need summits when the proper preparations have been made, when it is time for decision making, and when the appropriate steps can be taken. The results of every summit should also include a schedule showing when the results must be implemented, otherwise they will generate uncertainty rather than stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am very grateful to Mr Barroso for his speech because it continues and puts into operation the speech on the situation in which Europe finds itself. They make up a single entity. We need all the political instruments that form part of the monetary union and the internal market at a community level. We need a road map showing the date by which we can achieve economic and social union and the measures we have to take to get there.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Stability Pact and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) must be the right size for the monetary union. The requirement for unanimity leads to renationalisation, blocks progress and is inefficient and undemocratic. No measures must be taken in Europe without the involvement of all the parties, including the European Parliament. The haircut which is needed does not represent a solution on its own. We must have a complete package consisting of the haircut, recapitalisation, more funding for the EFSF, administrative reform, investment, growth, jobs and monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must monitor all the Member States itself to ensure that its rules are being followed. We must approve the financial subsidies given to Greece and to all other countries and we must support the process of managing this funding, for example, via a privatisation agency. The Commission is responsible for economic governance and Parliament must ensure that the democratic checks and balances are in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, euro area fiscal union. At last, someone has noticed the existence of Article 136; however, the President of the Commission spoke of a Commission-Council procedure. In fact, Article 136 also contemplates the possibility of regulations. It is therefore possible that, under Article 136, 17 Member States will vote in the Council and 27 in Parliament. We would like to know whether – as Parliament has requested – the Commission intends to propose regulations with the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to Article 136 for the conditionality of the stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the stability mechanisms themselves. The 21 July agreement is fine, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is fine, but the truth is that the quota method does not work. You must tell us if you think that the EFSM, which still exists, can continue to operate, especially after the ruling from the German Court, and if therefore it is possible to think in terms of the communitisation of the stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Secretary General of the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) today said that he would like to move on from monetary union to stability union. Without growth, development and employment, there can be no stability. You should tell us if the Commission agrees with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has understood this. In the week in which we voted on the six-pack which, in line with good Polish tradition, became a true Copernican revolution, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, gave an ambitious State of the Union speech, as a passionate European, and today he presented his road map to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, too, has understood the situation and will make it clear tomorrow, in a brief resolution, that the circumspect, step-by-step approach, which can work in ordinary times, will not give us any respite in this particular time of crisis. Only a comprehensive crisis plan, with both acute and structural and institutional measures, will break the cycle of mistrust. What I expect of us, members of the European Parliament, is that we will be able together to adopt a robust text for the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the President of the Commission to be just as courageous and convincing at the European summit as he was here with us, and I ask the Heads of State or Government that, instead of continually proclaiming that we are all interdependent, they also act consistently in that spirit. Acting consistently means acting quickly by agreeing an overall European plan that will really help us lift ourselves out of this crisis and put an end to a Union which is increasingly being governed by markets and uncontrolled credit rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, only if the summit that has been postponed becomes the summit of regained ambition will despair turn into hope, mistrust into trust, and will we be able to set a credible foundation for our European project of peace and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we can create a financial firewall in order to secure the financial stability of the European economy. Let us not forget, however, that it is also important to establish the most vital firewall for Europe’s economies, namely growth. If we cannot achieve the credibility of future economic growth, none of the other things we are talking about will help in the long run, and that must not be forgotten when we are talking about ‘more Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a more open Europe, a more competitive Europe and a more dynamic Europe, but sometimes I feel that we discuss ‘more Europe’ in the sense of more institutions, more forums for decision making and more and different structures. The risk of that is that we will end up not with more Europe but with more ‘Europes’: more divided and unable to benefit from the fact that the European economy is the world’s biggest.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also need the world’s biggest markets and that is why the Commission needs to enter an era of reform at the same time as we enter the era of austerity – which is necessary but is not enough. We need more growth as the firewall for the European economy, and more Europe – not more ‘Europes’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the Union faces many challenges and problems, the crisis, because of its appalling social impact, is undoubtedly the greatest. We have already had many debates in this plenary regarding the concrete steps that must be taken to resolve the crisis. I would therefore like to say that the European institutions must clearly take a much more aggressive standpoint and position. Gradual, considered and unanimous decision making must give way to a new approach in a time of crisis, otherwise there is a risk of collapse. We need new, functional, ambitious and genuine solutions – common European solutions. In my opinion, this is the greatest and most fundamental task of the EU Heads of State in the forthcoming summit.

I am referring, in particular, to an issue that was also raised by Ms Berès. When we were negotiating the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), we were aware that the Commission’s proposal was more demanding than the one that we had before. We agreed that there should be a series of fines; part of Parliament was against it, as you know, but we agreed. These fines were considered excessive by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, but there was an agreement with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible that, immediately after the approval of this balancing for the ‘six-pack’ by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Commission has tabled a proposal to cut all the Structural Funds, in addition to the penalties provided for in the ‘six-pack’ to punish countries that need to converge in order to comply because they have breached, probably not because they wanted to, but because they could not avoid it, the terms of the revised SGP?

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for a very substantive and serious debate which certainly reflects the depth of the current crisis in Europe and how it is affecting our citizens. The financial market turbulence which stems from the sovereign debt crisis is having very negative ramifications on the banking sector and its lending capacity and, even more significantly, is taking a very heavy toll on economic growth and job creation in Europe. That is why it is essential that we build up and implement a comprehensive strategy in order to overcome this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have said you want to see our proposals more precisely on paper. I understand that very well, but I can tell you today that we have adopted a road map for stability and growth, which presents a comprehensive but focused strategy for overcoming the economic and financial crisis, and includes several concrete policy objectives. Of course, many of these need to be further worked out in consultation with the other institutions – not least with Parliament, but also, for instance, with the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank – as well as the euro area Member States and other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you may remember, I hope, how the Commission called, back in January in our annual growth survey, for a comprehensive response to the crisis. That has not quite materialised. We were actually criticised for daring to make proposals which, according to some people, were not within our competence. Now our proposed strategy is based on those same broad outlines but is, of course, supplemented with new, strong elements that go beyond what we proposed in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, we have three immediate challenges which are very clearly outlined in this road map for stability and growth. First, as many of you said, we need to respond decisively to the problems in relation to Greece. The continuing doubts over Greece have contributed very significantly to undermining confidence in the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. They must be immediately and definitively removed, and that will require a decision on a sustainable solution for Greece within the euro area, with an effective second assessment programme based on adequate financing through private sector involvement alongside the public sector, and with robust implementation and monitoring mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lambsdorff commented favourably on our proposal and said he had already been in favour of such a line at an earlier stage. I think it can only be a good thing if we have a convergence of views. As I see it, we now have to finalise this kind of sustainable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Jaakonsaari called for a broader political consensus in Greece, and I fully agree with her. A broader political consensus is essential to support the efforts of assessment and economic reform for the benefit of Greek citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to enhance the euro area’s backstops against the crisis. The euro area must be fully equipped with financial firewalls sufficient to contain the current crisis. Recent decisions to create the EFSF and the permanent ESM have gone a long way to building these instruments, but they still need to be completed and complemented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now essential to make operational the decisions taken in July without delay, and to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of the EFSF in order to build a really strong financial backstop. This applies particularly with regard to the possibility of precautionary programmes which are pre-emptive in nature, and to improving the capacity of the EFSF to intervene, by purchasing government debt, in primary markets and to intervene under appropriate conditionality in secondary markets where exceptional market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the power of these backstop mechanisms need to be enhanced by maximising the utilisation of EFSF capacity without increasing the guarantees that underpin it, and within the rules of the Treaty of Lisbon. Early introduction of the European Stability Mechanism would also reinforce confidence in the crisis-resolution mechanism and would bring the advantages of a more robust permanent instrument. Efforts should therefore be made to accelerate the technical preparation and ratification procedures in order to have the ESM operational by, let us say, mid-2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to restore confidence in the EU banking sector through a coordinated, targeted effort of recapitalisation in conjunction with the other elements of our overall strategy. This calls for the combined efforts of the Member States, the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank, alongside the Commission and Parliament. Such a bank recapitalisation strategy must necessarily mean that banks which do not currently retain the necessary capital should present recapitalisation plans and implement them as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, banks should turn first to private sources of capital, including through restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments. If necessary, the national governments should provide support, and if such support is not available, then recapitalisation should be funded via a loan from the EFSF. Any recapitalisation from public sources should be compatible with the EU rules on State aid. We are ready to extend the applicability of the existing State aid framework for bank support beyond 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the basis of the newly adopted six-pack – for which I wish to thank you warmly – and with regard to fiscal and economic surveillance, we need to strengthen the stability orientation in our economic policy making. I count on your support for the firm implementation of the new instruments and the toolbox from day one, which should be in mid-December or, at the latest, on 1 January 2012. However, we should also be ready to look further ahead and to develop a vision and a road map for more effective economic governance. A long-term vision must combine discipline with integration and, in that context, we are also working on the report on options for the Stability Bonds, to be ready before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is encouraging to find that we – that is, not only Parliament and the Commission, but also the Polish Presidency – see eye to eye on what needs to be done to overcome the crisis. This is a major joint effort for you, for us, and for governments and oppositions in all the Member States. I count on your support and also on your efforts in terms of communication. We have only a few days to win the necessary public and political support for this kind of comprehensive strategy for a truly European way forward. Let us do it together and let us do it now! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An employment and social progress pact presupposes the complete abolition of the current Stability and Growth Pact in order to stop the exacerbation of the situation in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and other countries where problems are intensifying.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is an end to the veritable pacts of aggression against, and extortion of, the peoples that are victims of intervention by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. We have already seen the result of this in Greece. It would be good to take a different route before Portugal and Ireland end up in the same situation. It is time to bring to an end the impositions of the directorate, which continues to force disastrous policies on the peoples of states with weak economies and profound social injustices, in the interests of European big business. The proposal that they are drafting on the recapitalisation of the banks is an example of this, as it will be another huge transfer of bank debt to the public sector; in other words, onto the backs of the workers and peoples of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among others, the Polish Presidency was requested to take part in organising those meetings and is treating this request as a priority. In the situation of an escalating financial and economic crisis, we must do our best and commit ourselves to the task of developing coherent solutions, for this is the only way out of this grievous situation. As regards a solution to what is referred to as the Greek crisis, the way out lies through the additional capitalisation of banks and the increased efficiency of the European Financial Stability Facility. We must ensure that the next meeting meets the hopes placed in it – unlike the recent ‘crisis’ summits whose decisions have not yet been finally implemented (there has been no ratification of the decision to boost the EFSF in all 17 countries in the euro area following the last summit), yet which already require amendments and additions. I believe that our shared ambition should be to take decisive steps to prevent the debt crisis from spreading from Greece to, say, Spain. We need not look far to find examples of how serious the situation is. For example, the deterioration of the situation in the banking sector, which requires additional capitalisation, is illustrated by the recent liquidation of the French-Belgian bank Dexia, which in June held EUR 4.3 billion’s worth of Greek bonds. In these harsh times, I would like to appeal to the Member States and urge them to take an active part in joint actions.

A new package of regulations reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and the consolidation of public finances are decisive responses to the debt crisis affecting the countries within the European Union. While restoring budgetary balance in the Member States, we should also remember that the European economy also needs investment incentives and clear political signals that will encourage its development and restore economic growth in the long term. A basis for the success of the European economy and the main source of economic growth in Europe is a smoothly functioning single market. Therefore, further integration of the internal market should be a priority for the next few months, along with implementation and enforcement of the laws already in place. When deciding on how to steer the European economy out of the crisis, we should also keep in mind that problems in the euro area are problems which affect the entire Community. All Member States involved should therefore have a role to play in anti-crisis measures, including those who currently do not belong to the euro area. Let us hope that the result of this upcoming European summit will be an ambitious and detailed plan enabling the European economy to overcome the crisis eventually and the Member States to embark on a path of long-term growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The central issue of further expansion of solidarity and the EFSF will be conditionality. Conducting real structural reforms should be the principal condition for receiving further financial support. This has to apply for all circumstances, including support to recapitalise banks. Public capital injections require public control of bank management, including strict control of dividend policies, bonuses and salaries. Next to austerity measures, we also need growth and jobs. The EC has a key role here to finally make full use of the potential of the single market. There is absolutely no moral or political justification to further delay the completion of the single market.

I would like to remind you of the time when ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon was taking place and the socialists were in government in Slovakia; they were only able to ratify the Treaty with the help of the Party of the Hungarian Coalition, the opposition party I represent. Now, they have not only put European interests at risk, but also Slovakia’s political prestige and international credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The private banks which are the creditors of the main debtor countries in the euro area are on the verge of bankruptcy. The Commission’s plan to recapitalise the banks with loans from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is totally inappropriate. On the one hand, the EFSF, which has constantly had its funding increased, has long since reached its financial limits. If a (second) bank rescue package was made available, these limits would be exceeded in a way which would amount to negligence. On the other hand, we are still failing to combat the causes of the debt crisis. Instead, we are continuing to take the wrong approach, which involves turning the EU into a transfer union with centralised economic governance from Brussels, while disregarding the losses. In defiance of all the experts’ opinions, billions of euro are being wasted on rescuing ailing EU countries, such as Greece, and the predictable failure of this solution, which is doomed to disaster, is being used as an opportunity finally to abolish the sovereignty of the EU Member States by the back door. In order to achieve this pyrrhic victory, even the European Council has been pushed into the background to enable the Slovakian opposition, which was opposed to a new wave of payments, to give way before the Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">More plans for centralisation cannot help us out of the crisis. They will just make this difficult situation even worse. We need to move back to a union of countries with equal rights and independent economic policies. We must create a smaller hard monetary union consisting of economically powerful states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following analysis of the internal challenges, it is time to look at external economic policy. The Union must fight for its position in the world. The longer we delay doing this, the more difficult it will be to maintain our current position, not to mention increasing our role. We need to react more effectively to changes in the world economy. To strengthen its potential for development, the Union must undertake initiatives in external relations. These issues, amongst others, should be the focus of the forthcoming EU summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis should be placed on bilateral and regional agreements concerning different areas of cooperation with strategic partners whose markets are undergoing dynamic development. To increase its potential in relation to world partners, the Union must promote a European model of economic growth based on competitiveness, social responsibility and ecological sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must continue to be open to potential new members from Europe. An organism which does not grow becomes weak and then dies. It is important to pursue an effective policy on development and trade. In relation to this, it is necessary to support measures which help mitigate the effects of climate change in the poorest regions and to continue action to eliminate poverty, in particular, through the importing of agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be a more effective advocate of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.

As in 2008, the EU is now intending to recapitalise Europe’s banks. The higher incidence of financial crises in recent years highlights that we are attempting to address only the effects, and not the causes of the economic and financial crises, using obsolete instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to bring about a more radical change to Europe’s financial system. This also means that new financial instruments need to be developed. If a rapid, major restructuring of the financial sector fails to take place, the EU could find itself again, in a few years, in the situation of recapitalising the banks. The EU must adopt measures promoting economic growth and job creation without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens want peace and prosperity and are concerned nowadays about their own and their children’s future. They want decent jobs and a decent living so that each of them is included in society and makes a useful contribution to it. This is why the European Union must urgently invest in an ambitious, eco-efficient industrial policy, capable of providing jobs across the EU.

In fact, the situation of Romania and Bulgaria can be compared to a football match which both countries have lost, not on the pitch, but through a random decision. Although they trained hard for it and played very well technically, both countries have failed to qualify for the ‘Schengen League’ because some referees decided that the original rules and fair play do not matter and have devised new rules, right in the middle of the game, which no one is actually familiar with, but which have extremely serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally wish to thank the Polish Presidency for the constant efforts it has made, aimed at achieving my country’s accession to the Schengen area. However, the fact that we are debating a resolution today on a matter which we already decided by vote four months ago highlights what a tough stalemate the European Union is currently in. This is why I find it absurd that we have two versions of the truth, one from the European Parliament and the other from the Council, about the freedom of movement within Europe’s borders. I am sure that the authorities and officials in the Netherlands and Finland understand that European citizens have rights which cannot be interpreted and applied differently, according to the nationality or ethnic group they belong to by birth. However, they have given in to trivial, though vociferous domestic pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">If we feel a sense of responsibility, we cannot allow a new split in Europe: either east-west or north-south. This is precisely what the far-right parties are expecting, that people, feeling duped and confused, will refuse to be governed from Brussels any longer. This is why the double standards must be dropped from both the speeches made by Europe’s political leaders and from their decisions. If these double standards had not existed, Romania and Bulgaria would have already been part of the Schengen area, and this decision would have produced a positive impact on the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What hypocrisy! True, the Netherlands and Finland were the ones who vetoed this application, but the majority of the Member States, starting with France and Germany, seem to share their misgivings. Yet Romania and Bulgaria have now fulfilled the conditions that were imposed on new members in 2008, and they seem to be even better prepared than some of the countries that were accepted without hesitation at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for so-called guarantees regarding the fight against corruption and organised crime has been cited. Dare I say it, that is a load of rubbish. What is the sad reality? The political developments in a number of Member States are the only real reason for this refusal. Xenophobia is increasingly undermining Europe, and fears are being played on, because the underlying reason for this refusal is still the fear of a lack of border controls, and it shows what the reality of the Schengen area is.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the so-called principle of the free movement of persons work if some European citizens are denied that which is granted to citizens of non-EU countries? The reality of the Schengen area is that it is increasingly becoming a security area in the strictest sense of the word, a security-based police area that allows Europe to turn in on itself. It is a fortress Europe that refuses to take in a few million Tunisians or to reach out to a few dozen Libyan refugees. The Finnish and Dutch governments’ courting of popular opinion and, hence, voters, is broadly supported in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Can it explain to us which new criteria are going to be imposed on Romania and Bulgaria? When will the same principle of reversed qualified majority voting that is applied to economic matters be introduced for matters relating to human rights, justice and freedom? For how long are we going to let the Union drift, and for how long will the interests of the few continue to take precedence over the general interest? Yes, the European Union has a governance problem, but it is not a problem of economic governance; it is a problem of political governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The continuing delay and blocking by Member States, in particular, the Netherlands and Finland, of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> risks creating that two-tier system for EU Member States. Bulgaria and Romania have met the criteria to join Schengen, the same criteria that were applied to each Member State that has previously joined the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Furthermore, this has been judged and verified by the independent expert EU committee, yet some Member States are now taking the political initiative of blocking their accession on the basis that they have serious levels of corruption and organised crime. Of course corruption and organised crime are serious issues, but the approach to these serious issues is disingenuous and is creating a problem with one of the key principles of the European Union and its freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an ongoing evaluation mechanism to judge organised crime and corruption, but we must not pervert that mechanism in creating a two-tier system for these countries. The Member States should be treated equally and fairly. We work hard to tackle all forms of discrimination and we have to ensure that we do not allow for the creation of a subsidiarity position for Romania and Bulgaria. Of course we welcome efforts to strengthen and improve the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>; re-evaluating any legislation is necessary to improve it and adapt it to be able to best respond to current demands and situations. However, the rules that we create must also be respected by all Member States in Council. It should not be that we negotiate EU legislation which is then ignored by some Member States and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to strengthen Schengen and ensure that an instrument which was created for solidarity purposes across the EU – for the freedom of individuals across the EU – is not now used to divide it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it undertook to comply with the obligations contained in the Schengen Agreement and fulfil the provisions included in the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism relating to justice and the fight against corruption. Both commitments include separately requirements and sanctions in the event of non-compliance. The mechanism is still applicable. The Commission drafts progress reports every year and has the option to apply the stipulated sanctions in the event of failing to comply with the scheduled phases. The Schengen road map has been fulfilled in its entirety, in keeping with current EU provisions, which was confirmed by the decision made by the JHA Council in June this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the European Council in June, including Romania, proposed a review of the Schengen criteria, but clearly stated in the conclusions that this proposal would not affect the accession process involving Romania and Bulgaria. Unfortunately, the JHA Council has not kept to its own decision in June and did not adopt any decision in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation we are in is completely unclear, with no sign of hope, where a Member State is fulfilling its obligations, but is being blocked, and we might even say, punished by other Member States without any legally justified reasons. Furthermore, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission is the only body which can propose sanctions against a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is based on a number of principles, including trust and, in particular, mutual respect. In the current situation, I believe that the European Council needs to intervene. I call on the European Council to discuss this matter and make a fair decision based on the proper merits of both Member States, for the benefit of all Member States and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These are not the words of the populist parties and movements, but of Europol in its 2010 report on organised crime. There is no populist propaganda, but a serious security problem. Were Bulgaria to join the Schengen area at this time, law enforcement and security agencies predict that Bulgaria’s borders, especially its maritime ones, would become easy targets for organised crime syndicates from Eastern Europe and Turkey, and Bulgaria and Romania would become the crossroads for trafficking of human beings and drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is natural that some Member States should have many reservations about the real capacity of Bulgaria and Romania to ensure effective border control against organised crime and corruption, and so it is quite natural that they should oppose their membership of Schengen. Allowing them in now means opening the door to transnational organised crime syndicates and opening a gaping hole in Europe’s borders where there is intense migratory pressure from Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many reasons to oppose this and Europe cannot ignore them. I would therefore like to know what the intentions of the Commission and Council are on this delicate question, which I think has so far been treated recklessly, without taking into account the dangers that the entry of Bulgaria and Romania would entail, according to the competent bodies dealing with security and international crime.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission and the Council should postpone the entry of these two countries into Schengen and give the go-ahead only when there is reasonable assurance that the entry of Bulgaria and Romania will have no impact on the security of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the question of Bulgaria and Romania’s accession to the Schengen area is so particularly important to members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you all know that the Council discussed this matter at the meeting of 22-23 September on the basis of a compromise proposal put forward by the Presidency. It was drafted in response to fears – expressed earlier by some Member States – over the initial request for a decision on a framework for full application of the provisions of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it became clear that it would be impossible to guarantee the unanimous support within the Council which is essential to reaching agreement. Therefore, the Presidency decided not to put the request for a Council decision to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, as you know, the Act of Accession of 2005 provides for verification through an evaluation procedure in order to guarantee that Bulgaria and Romania fulfil the conditions necessary for application of all parts of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>. This is an essential condition for the Council so that it can – after consultations with the European Parliament – decide on full application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the consequent abolition of checks at internal borders and at borders between these two Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">These evaluations were carried out between 2009 and 2011. After completion of the evaluation process, on 9 June this year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted conclusions corroborating the fact that the necessary preconditions enabling the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal air, land and sea borders have been met. The Council also agreed that it would come back to this matter as soon as possible and not later than September this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish Presidency submitted a compromise proposal to the Council. This proposal provided for the gradual abolition of internal border checks: initially at air and sea borders, and then at land borders. This proposal was also the fruit of a process of intensive discussions with the Member States, including, of course, Bulgaria and Romania. As I have already said, it did not receive the necessary unanimous support.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still treating the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area as a priority, and we are involved in work which will enable a quick decision to be made on this matter. The Polish Presidency is determined to ensure that agreement is reached quickly on this matter, and to this end we are going to continue to work on a balanced approach which will allay the specific fears expressed by some Member States while also providing for the abolition of checks at land borders in a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will keep Parliament informed about this situation as it develops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Chamber has already made its position clear and we reiterate it today: namely, that Bulgaria and Romania should be allowed to join Schengen once they fulfil the entry conditions. We say this out of a basic sense of fairness and respect for the rule of law, so we are very surprised and deeply disappointed that, despite Bulgaria’s and Romania’s having fulfilled the conditions for membership – the same conditions that were applied to all the rest of us – the Council failed to ratify the decision to give them the green light.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that this happened because of the opposition of two Member States – the Netherlands and Finland – which wield a veto on the decision. That is disappointing because both these countries have a strong European tradition of respect for fairness and the rule of law. As it happens, both their governments rely on the support of populist parties. I would not like to think that the reason for the blockage is that these governments are held hostage to populism, because that would be very worrying indeed. We need to stand up to populism by explaining to the public that fairness dictates respect for the rules, and that when the rules are respected, we should draw the appropriate conclusions: in this case, by allowing both Bulgaria and Romania to join the border-free area of Schengen. We should not be afraid to explain this to the public. We should not be afraid of taking fair decisions, and we should not be afraid to show political responsibility. Not to do so would be to move the goalposts after the game has started, and that is simply not fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is obviously not interested in this or in the will of MEPs, preferring to take part in the pre-election campaign in Bulgaria rather than deal with this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We are urging with today’s resolution for both the Commissioners and ministers of the Council to become fully involved in making a decision or setting a definite timetable for Bulgaria and Romania to join Schengen. This case involving the accession of both countries is an extremely serious matter because it casts doubt over the effectiveness of European law. The criteria for becoming members of this area have been fulfilled, but no decision has been made. The Council has put the Commission and all of us in a legal tangle, as it allowed new requirements to be imposed on both countries during the same accession procedure. The European Commission must issue a much tougher response to this behaviour from the Council as it is the guardian of the Treaties and oversees their compliance. The European Commission must ensure that the new package being proposed for assessing compliance with the Schengen criteria will be complied with by all Member States and will not be dependent on political realities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to reply to Ms Bizzotto by quoting a statement made today by our Socialist colleague: ‘If we had a similar attitude to combating crime and corruption in Member States as to Bulgaria and Romania, Italy ought to have left Schengen a long time ago’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some Member States have shown their reservations about Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area – and they do this despite the Romanian and Bulgarian people having worked so incredibly hard to meet the criteria that have been set for them – but calling those reservations xenophobic or racist, as we heard a moment ago, is a cheap and unworthy suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Romania and Bulgaria are the victims of the current criteria which are outdated and lack coordination with modern European concerns, concerns which should rightfully include corruption and organised crime. We have the resources through Europol, Eurojust and Frontex – and indeed OLAF – to improve the system, to find a better way forward by making sure that Member States are ready to join. By ignoring this reality, we do ourselves, the Schengen area and the Member States in question a gross disservice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Double standards were applied to Bulgaria and Romania throughout the whole process of their accession to the European Union. I have been listening to us for six years in this Chamber denying that double standards are applied. Nevertheless, the negotiations were conducted based on double standards and the accession process was a glaring example of double standards because Bulgaria and Romania were separated from the other 10 countries in the fifth enlargement round. Double standards apply to the process for joining the euro. Now it is the turn of Schengen – the next example of double standards. In fact, look at who is imposing a veto – the Netherlands – a country which recently showed that it actually does not want to be part of Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is not whether Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the criteria, nor is it even the desire of the Dutch and Finnish governments to apply double standards. The problem lies, ladies and gentlemen, in the actual system which you federalists have set up – a crazy, absurd and pointless system which needs to be scrapped and does not have any kind of practical use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet now, when we should be congratulating these two governments and receiving these two countries into the Schengen area, the Council is refusing to rule in favour, owing to the opposition of two Member States. It is crucial that the Council overcome this situation swiftly, so as not to exacerbate the sense of injustice and disappointment in Europe felt by the peoples of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

We have created a system in which freedom of movement is maintained and strengthened, so we need a new Schengen evaluation system. Mr President, while we are talking about free movement and Schengen, the president of the Portuguese youth organisation, who is a member of the Portuguese Parliament, has brought to my attention what is happening in Ukraine. The president of the opposition youth group has been beaten by Ukrainian police, along with other leaders, and their homes have been raided and searched without warrants.

In fact, at the moment, it embodies all the ills which have been afflicting the European Union for some time: ignorance about European rules and treaties, populism, nationalism, the decline of solidarity and denial of basic rights, such as the right to free movement. I believe that the European Parliament has a duty to remind everyone of the values on which the European Union is founded and to condemn the selfish, anti-European behaviour displayed by some Member States, ensnared by far-right populism.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, said recently, the vote of a minority should not dictate the will of the large majority and the EU.

However, we cannot agree to one or two Member States blocking the desire of the others to take the European project forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which we are going to vote on tomorrow is not just about Romania and Bulgaria.

The Schengen working group gave a positive assessment. The Council decided that both countries were ready. Parliament also confirmed this. Even on 24 June, government leaders agreed to adopt the decision no later than September. The obvious logic in this sequence of events has currently produced no result. Bulgaria and Romania are continuing to wait until goodness knows when. Requirements are being imposed on them which seem to have been produced on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> basis. These requirements do not derive from the Accession Treaty. They create inequality. The two Member States which blocked the accession of Romania and Bulgaria are stubbornly defending a paradox.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stated outright that refusing to decide in favour of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession creates an unacceptable situation turning into political isolation for both countries. Our Union should not fall prey to isolationism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, both countries seem to be complying with the Schengen criteria, but these criteria are too soft and inadequate. No account is being taken of corruption, human trafficking or organised crime, and it is precisely in these areas that both countries have to do a lot more work. The European Union ought to assist them in that respect, and let us then talk about the accession again in a few years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Schengen is under pressure. Greece and Italy are hardly able to cope with the influx of immigrants and asylum seekers any more. We first have to resolve those problems before we continue talking about Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Dexia also passed the stress test for banks, but this bank was rescued this week at the very last moment. Politicians are the very people who ought to keep their eyes and ears open for differences between theory and everyday reality.

We all know that Bulgaria and Romania continue to face very serious problems, such as organised crime and corruption. Those are problems that will, by definition, spill over into other Member States when the borders disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is also the problem of Bulgaria not yet having taken a number of measures in order to enhance its cooperation with Greece and Turkey on improving border management. The problem of mass illegal migration via Turkey is well known. The countries which are opposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area are not doing so merely in their own national interests, but also in the interests of all Member States of the European Union, because the Schengen area can only work if there is confidence that all Member States are fully complying with all conditions.</p>

Unfortunately, the reality in Europe is different. Member States are not abiding by the rules they have adopted. The upshot of this is that we have an economic and financial crisis and we have Bulgaria’s and Romania’s Schengen membership being blocked. The actual reality is as follows: both countries fulfilled all the criteria which were used to assess the countries that joined Schengen at an earlier stage and which were enshrined in the accession treaties. There is not a single argument to support the notion that the two countries’ accession poses a risk to the Schengen area. On the contrary, allow me to support with facts the argument that Bulgaria contributes to the security of Europe’s citizens. Both Bulgaria and Romania became part of the Schengen Information System in November 2010. Since the start of November 2010 up until 11 October 2011, according to the data, Bulgaria has provided Schengen Member States with information about the following matters: 323 persons wanted for arrest; 1 383 motor vehicles, personal documents, weapons and other personal items being sought in Schengen area countries; 92 missing persons; 1 208 persons involved in criminal proceedings in the Schengen area; 737 persons discreetly monitored; and more than 8 000 rejected visa applications for entering the Schengen area. Bulgaria and Romania always perform their duty of solidarity to all the other citizens in the European Union.</p>

It would also mean the elimination of the unjust borders imposed upon Hungary under the Treaty of Trianon. At the same time, however, I also understand the Dutch and the Finns in the sense that we have to look at the crime statistics too. This is not hard to do; they are not talking about fiction, but about reality.</p>
<p class="contents">And what the crime statistics show is that Romania is not yet ready to be part of Schengen. Also, joining Schengen represents an extension of a country’s legal framework.

For that reason, the situation with regard to Bulgaria and Romania must be examined as a whole, because the internal security situation of a potentially acceptable Member State cannot reflect negatively on the other Schengen states. When the Schengen rules are enforced, it is particularly important that a Member State is able to fight corruption and organised crime and that the judicial systems of countries work effectively. Bulgaria and Romania must genuinely fulfil these requirements before they can be accepted into the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">A report under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), published in the spring, stated that both countries were showing progress but that there were still serious weaknesses. That is why the conclusions drawn by Finland and the Netherlands are, I think, clear. Technical readiness is not enough if we cannot persuade people to accept that border guards cannot be bribed. In Finland, attention has also focused on the weak position of the Roma minority and on the fact that many Roma have had to leave their homeland to apply for asylum or to beg elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the security of the area of free movement, it is sensible to encourage Romania and Bulgaria to make efforts to enable their accession to the Schengen area. The next natural review date falls next spring, when we can expect to receive the Commission’s interim report.</p>

After all, they have fulfilled the requirements of the agreements on accession to the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some other agreements were made in 2007, too, at the time when these countries joined the EU: those on combating corruption. According to recent Commission reports, the results leave much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements may directly impact on the European area of freedom and security. Do not get me wrong. I want a strong Schengen area with Romania and Bulgaria, one that will ensure our citizens retain their faith in a Europe without internal borders. After all, the external borders will only be as strong as the weakest link. There should be no doubt about that, but doubt there is. I therefore ask the Council how they intend to resolve this?

They have not only fulfilled the technical details of the Schengen Agreement, but have also taken very specific measures at their borders in order to safeguard the external borders of the European Union. The claim that they have only met the small-scale technical requirements is simply wrong. Everyone can go to these borders and see what Bulgaria and Romania have done to bring about a massive improvement in standards and in education and training and to see the measures that have been taken to secure the external borders. In my opinion, their efforts have been significantly underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the subject of corruption has repeatedly been mentioned, together with organised crime. I think it is right for us to discuss these matters and I also think it is right for us to take serious measures to combat corruption and organised crime within the context of the Schengen Agreement. However, laying the responsibility solely at the door of Bulgaria and Romania is wrong. There are also significant problems relating to corruption and organised crime within the Schengen countries. Therefore, against this background, and with regard to securing the external borders, I am calling specifically for the fulfilment of the Schengen Agreement in all the Member States to be evaluated, because it is necessary to ensure that all the Schengen countries meet the requirements, not only those which want to join. We need long-term safeguards and not simply short-term demands on two Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> when they acceded to the Union in 2007. Both countries have fundamentally revised and reorganised their integrated border control systems, visibly strengthening their institutional and legal framework.

<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call on all Member States to adopt the decision to expand the Schengen area to include these two states exclusively on the basis of the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and the Schengen procedures that are currently in force.

The vague reasons given and any additional criteria conceal serious consequences. They are of fundamental importance in the long term.

Because, in reality, it is not. Within the Union, a tug-of-war is being waged between those States which want more union and those States which want less union. We are trying to find compromises allowing Member States to choose and pick which initiatives they wish to participate in. Schengen is perhaps one of the best examples. But there are others like the eurozone. Selecting parts of a menu is resulting in a Europe <span class="italic">à la carte</span>. I have advocated that in order for Europe to be taken seriously and be seen as a meaningful power, it has to have a common project, a common aim, a common direction.

In fact, it is to be expected that some Member States, already subject to intense flows of immigration, may be put under increasing strain with the entry into the Schengen area of two countries that do not seem to have achieved sufficient control of their external borders. This is particularly clear with regard to the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. We cannot allow the free movement of citizens unless we are satisfied that this does not lead to increases in petty crime and illegal immigration, reductions in security and risks to public order. The data on the fight against organised crime in these two countries are hardly comforting for those who desire to see a serious and effective EU policy against organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two Member States are blocking Schengen accession for Romania and Bulgaria in the Council of Ministers. This undermines the EU’s credibility and legal certainty: we cannot apply double standards! Access to the Schengen area is also a matter of trust: should the task of guarding the EU’s external borders be entrusted to a country which, according to all the assessments, fully complies with all the prescribed criteria? The answer is unequivocal: yes. Unvoiced opinions and interests are at play behind the obstruction of Bulgaria and Romania’s Schengen accession, and this is further damaging public confidence. Delaying the enlargement of the Schengen area heightens the disappointment felt by the EU’s Bulgarian and Romanian citizens. The most likely victims of this frustration will be the disadvantaged communities that are being treated as scapegoats for the delay in reaching a decision on accession to Schengen. In the midst of a crisis, the last thing the EU needs is to sow distrust among the Member States and send feelings running even higher. We must make a clear stand in support of Schengen accession for Bulgaria and Romania and introduce an appropriate Schengen evaluation system as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, if Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled the necessary conditions, it is not fair play to delay the decision on enlargement. We need decisions which are both rapid and carefully considered. Europe must be united. All the Member States should work together, not on their own, and for the common good, particularly now during the crisis in Europe. What we need is mutual cooperation and mutual trust.

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that while the European Union is delaying the decision without providing a proper explanation based on European law and in keeping with mutual trust among the Member States, Romania has complied fully with the accession criteria laid down in the Schengen Agreement. Some say that the unresolved issue of Romanian corruption is the reason why the decision on accession has been delayed. Aside from the fact that there is nothing in the law that connects Schengen accession and the extent of corruption in a given Member State, do you really think that corruption problems in some Member States should prompt the remaining Member States to exclude those countries from certain aspects of European integration?

We should not artificially create difficulties and impose additional, previously unforeseen requirements on those two countries in particular. Protection against organised crime, drug dealing or money laundering is unquestionably important, but if both those Member States have improved their controls in these areas, in accordance with the rules of the Schengen system, they should not be blocked in this way on the grounds of widespread fears about unwanted immigration, for example, when there are often no specific data to support those fears.

Both countries took this process in good faith and prepared according to the rules. But something changed. There is a pressure to change the rules of the game during the game. This is not only unfair towards two Member States that were singled out. This is detrimental to the European solidarity principle. It happens at a most unfortunate time, when true European values are tested by radical agendas and political forces. The Schengen debate was largely absorbed by this sort of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution adopted today is a step in the right direction. The resolution proved that there is a consensus in the European Parliament on the need to promote the interests of a coherent and united Europe, especially in times of doubt and crisis. Romania and Bulgaria should not be treated differently. Once they fulfil the original criteria, they should be allowed to join the Schengen area. The same rules should work from now on for future candidates. The European Parliament always supported this approach.

In actual fact, these countries are already protecting the eastern borders according to the Schengen criteria, even though, officially, they are not part of the area. These are the facts, but this is where the problems start. The EU is divided over the measures to take to exit the growing financial and debt crisis when this union’s very existence is under threat. Two countries are blocking the Council’s decision on Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen without having any legal grounds whatsoever for this. It seems as if everyone is thinking about number one. This inevitably raises the question whether the EU can take tough decisions in such a complicated situation when the only response is more Europe, more synergy and solidarity, and not disunity and national protectionism. In light of this, the forthcoming Council meeting on 23 October will be a test of the EU’s ability and of whether its leaders are up to meeting the expectations of its citizens to take decisive actions to deal with the impending threats, which includes rejecting populist domestic policy objectives in order to save Europe. The decision on Bulgaria and Romania joining Schengen will be part of this test. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to come again to the Parliament. It was only two weeks ago in Strasbourg that we discussed the situation in our Southern Neighbourhood and we felt that sense of impatience and uncertainty, that real change does takes time, and we know it will be measured in years and not in seasons. But we also recognised the importance of our continuing support and tonight we will focus on Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain where the latest events remind us of what we were saying two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with Egypt and start by being absolutely clear that what we saw in Egypt on Sunday night was totally unacceptable. We were all shocked and appalled by the violence against a peaceful demonstration by the Coptic Christian community that led to the death of 25 people, with more than 300 injured.</p>
<p class="contents">These clashes run contrary to the whole spirit and goals of the revolution and the aspirations of all Egyptians – of all backgrounds and beliefs. They stood side by side asking for legitimate human rights after 30 years of authoritarian rule. The Egyptian uprising belongs to the whole population of Egypt. Protection of human rights is essential. I believe that is the only way to ensure that we are going to have true democracy. I made a statement calling for calm and restraint and an investigation so that those responsible for the violence can be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I urged and I urged the authorities to protect the right to demonstrate peacefully, and the right to freedom of religion or belief – one of the most fundamental of all human rights. Yet the worst thing now would be for these tragic events to stand in the way of democracy. On the contrary, we have to learn these lessons fast. Sunday’s events should encourage the government and the ruling military council to investigate, to listen, to review the emergency law and to step up the dialogue with political representatives ahead of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation met today with representatives from the Al-Azhar University and Mosque who can play a very important role in the dialogue between different communities. As we have said before in this House, Egypt faces its first opportunity to hold free and fair elections and we will work to help the judges and poll workers in the management of the upcoming parliamentary elections later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to work both on the process towards democracy and in the relaunch of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the example of the Task Force in Tunisia last week, here we were able to bring together the international community – European institutions, Members of this House, Member States, the European Investment Bank, the Bank for Reconstruction and Development, multilateral financial institutions and, crucially, private sector companies – making sure that together we become a catalyst for quicker and more effective assistance; in Tunisia in this case, but important, of course, across the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We were able to pull together a package of EUR 4 billion over three years for Tunisia. We plan to do the same in other countries in the region where that collaborative approach can make a significant difference to the economic opportunities in those countries: Jordan, Egypt, and other countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, too, that we will be able to do something for Syria in the near future, where the situation remains totally unacceptable and where we must continue pressure on the regime – bilaterally and internationally. You have noted our sanctions and their gradual expansion to include oil exports – even now, additional sanctions are under preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have also seen our efforts in the UN Security Council and in the Human Rights Council. Member States worked hard in the Security Council to try to get a resolution but were unable to achieve that. I believe we have to redouble our efforts and I will be raising our concerns with our strategic partners, the United States and China, over these coming next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sign, of course, in Syria of the regime abandoning violence and repression and the risk of spiralling violence and sectarian rifts is very real. The recent incidents of targeted killings confirm this danger. That is why the unity of the people and the new political leaders on the ground is essential. We welcome all efforts by the Syrian opposition to come together. The creation of the Syrian National Council is encouraging. Inclusiveness, commitment to non-violence, human rights and democratic values are essential in that process. I believe this Parliament is unique in what it can offer to promote those values and is well placed to offer a forum for dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also seek to associate Arab countries in all of our efforts. We will remain steadfast and determined to support the people of Syria. Our sanctions are not directed against them but against the regime and those who support it, and we continue to send a message to the people of Syria that we wish to help them achieve their aspirations and will mobilise our assistance and improve our trade and economic links as soon as we see that genuine transition begin.</p>
<p class="contents">In Yemen, we wait and watch President Saleh, who has talked again about transferring power, but I am not convinced that he is listening to his people. Surely this time, he must match his words with deeds and transfer that power now. The time for empty promises is gone. The President and his family must stop holding the country’s future to ransom, not least when we look at the tragedy of the humanitarian situation: there is a great lack of fuel, power, food and water, and people face chronic malnutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before the current crisis, 7.5 million people – one third of all Yemenis – did not have enough to eat. 400 000 Yemeni people are internally displaced, and the country hosts over 200 000 refugees from the Horn of Africa. How exactly that transition goes forward is for the Yemeni parties themselves to work out. But they have long ago accepted the principles of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s initiative. We have engaged at all levels, trying to facilitate peaceful solutions among the key players in Yemen. I have been working closely with the GCC and with the United States to keep a strong and united front, sequencing and coordinating our messages and actions on the ground and in our capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also played a key role through the UN Human Rights Council, and will now step that up through our Member States in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a 32-year-old Yemeni woman, Tawakkul Karman, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Her first meeting with the international community was hosted by our Head of Delegation on Sunday. He transmitted first hand my message that the prize recognises her relentless commitment to human rights, and particularly to the rights of women. Women are at the forefront of the fight against repressive regimes and they must remain central to the shaping of the reforms that follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, and finally, to Bahrain, where we have been following the situation very closely and we have made clear our views in statements and in direct talks with the Foreign Minister and with the King. This morning, the Bahraini Ambassador was called again to my services. We have adopted conclusions in the Foreign Affairs Council several times and we will not do other than continue to put the situation in the forefront of our work and of our statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many amongst the honourable Members here, I have spoken out against the death penalty – actually all of my life – and the harsh sentences handed down in cases connected to the recent unrest. Special courts should not be used to try civilians and I have urged the Bahraini authorities to stick to the commitments they have made and guarantee fair trials.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I take some positive note of last week’s decision to retry in civil courts the trials against doctors and nurses accused of tending to the medical needs of those who oppose the regime. That request, from us, was heard, but now surely civilian courts should move to drop all charges.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision should be extended to all civilians tried in the Security Courts. About 60 more civilians, aside from those medical personnel, have been sentenced in these courts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this month, the International Commission investigating the human rights violations will deliver its report. All the documented allegations must be followed up properly – whoever the presumed perpetrator is.</p>
<p class="contents">Our members have also led the way in Geneva to try to secure follow-up to this Independent Commission’s findings in the Human Rights Council, and to allow the High Commissioner’s Office to visit. On both fronts, I have to say, the Bahraini authorities have chosen to remain evasive.</p>
<p class="contents">The investigations should change the political climate and should encourage reconciliation. There needs to be far more and better dialogue between the authorities and the opposition. The authorities should, in my view, inject confidence into this process so that those groups with a legitimate grievance can come to the table.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say though, that without dialogue, without real dialogue and real reforms, there can be no long-term, sustainable solutions to the challenges that are faced in Bahrain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an awakening of freedom, of the safeguarding of human dignity, human rights and democracy; yet now we are looking at Egypt with concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As Baroness Ashton has just said, reports of many Copts and Christians having died – possibly even having been murdered – must necessarily give rise to great concern. We need to cry out to the countries of the Arab revolution, of the uprisings, and tell them to protect their minorities – because if minorities are not protected, then in the end, it will be their own freedom that is the target.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must call on Field Marshal Tantawi and his government to have these incidents investigated and to ensure that those who simply drove their vehicles over people are brought to trial and sentenced – even if they are soldiers. Anyone who has exercised violence must receive the proper punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not make the mistake whereby, because there is increased violence in some Arab states, we forget the many millions who are championing freedom, democracy, peace and dialogue between cultures. Those taking part in Sunday’s demonstrations included not only 100 000 Coptic Christians, but also Muslims. They were demonstrating peacefully with the Christians. Let us not forget, therefore, that millions of peaceable Muslims have a desire for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2008, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Hassoun, visited the European Parliament. He gave a remarkable speech. He is undoubtedly also a man who is to be considered as being close to the criminal system of President Assad, who should resign. Now, however, the youngest son of this Grand Mufti, who is undoubtedly innocent, has also been brutally murdered – possibly by fundamentalists. In other words, the Muslims are paying the price too. That is why we must work towards achieving tolerance for all, and we should continue to support the movement for democracy in Arab countries with all our strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic features in almost every session of the European Parliament. We debate it, put forward solutions and call for action from the Commission, the Council and you personally. We greatly appreciate your speedy responses and the clear views you express. However, we have to admit that things are not changing at all for the better; quite the opposite in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Syria is gradually starting to get out of control. The resistance is becoming increasingly violent. The regime in Damascus clearly has no intention of stopping the violence and initiating rapid political reforms. On the contrary, it is even threatening to stir up a large-scale regional conflict which it wants to draw Israel and Iran into. Such behaviour always conveys weakness and uneasiness, which do not bode well for either the Syrian people or the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Processes are going on in Egypt which inspire mixed feelings. On the one hand, Egypt is approaching its first democratic elections, while international observers were not invited. Regardless of the official explanation for this, this is not a good sign. There are growing trends which may stymie the advance towards democracy from Tahrir Square. Inter-religious tension is nothing new, but instead of religious freedom being guaranteed, the conflicts are growing. The involvement of the security forces in what we can only describe as a massacre on Sunday is extremely alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on you, Baroness Ashton, to insist on a full investigation into the events, as you stated, as well as on punishment and prosecution for the guilty parties, and new guarantees from the authorities in Egypt that the rights of minorities, including religious minorities, will be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we need to seek clearer support and commitment from our strategic partners with designs on a global role, such as Russia and China, as well as from EU membership candidate countries. I am thinking of Turkey, which should get involved more actively in joint actions carried out by the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not ask any questions, but I would like you to take the opportunity of being present here to tell us whether there are other steps which the European Parliament can take to support your efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We debated a wide variety of demands, which differ from country to country. From your comments here, I understand that you are looking in detail at essentially the same things as we have been hearing about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore simply like to emphasise here how essential it is that the EU supports the efforts of civil society in particular, and supports those working for non-violent change.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned that you are encouraging dialogue with civil society in Bahrain. We heard this too, but we also heard that, although representatives of civil society believe in reform, they do not think it likely that a serious dialogue will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Within civil society, it is also important that the EU should stand up for women and their organisations. The fact that they exist, and are active, was shown by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Tawakkul Karman, a Yemeni woman who founded the association ‘Journalists Without Chains’ back in 2006 and has been mobilising civil protests in Yemen since the beginning of this year. I am pleased that – as you mentioned, Baroness Ashton – the EU delegation in Yemen has already been in contact with her. The award of the prize does not just honour a woman who works hard for gender equality as a Muslim woman in a society heavily dominated by men; at the same time, the Nobel Committee has sent out an important signal that the fight for women’s rights and liberation must play a central part in the Arab uprisings. Any government that comes to power in the wake of the changes in society must work towards this. I hope that the EU will promote this as much as it can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all hope in this House that Sirte falls soon to the Transitional National Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most recent reports coming from Egypt of the deaths of dozens of Coptic Christians, who were protesting peacefully and killed as a result of a brutal overreaction by the security forces, are shocking and need investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is concern both in Tunisia and in Egypt over the rise of hard-line Salafist influences now, and therefore in my view, the more moderate Islamist elements of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt need engaging with and need to be made to understand that they must pledge to respect international obligations made by Egypt on human rights if they are elected to power.</p>
<p class="contents">The brutal repression of the Syrian uprising by contrast has led tragically to 3 000 deaths so far, with President Assad sadly refusing to go and appealing to minorities such as his own set, the Alawites, and the Christians to resist the Sunni-led insurgency. The EU must now support the freezing of Syrian assets in Europe, ban oil imports and lean more on Russia and China in the Security Council for support with the hope of speeding up the Syrian National Council’s bid to topple the Ba’athist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Yemen’s traditional alliance with the US against al-Qaeda is laudable but the regime is authoritarian. Street protestors have called for UN aid in forcing Ali Abdullah Saleh from power now, but the ECR welcomes the fact that the cases of medics jailed in Bahrain, for instance, for treating injured protestors are now due to be reviewed, which will give some credibility to the Bahraini Monarchy’s quest for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR calls on the EU to mobilise all available means to the Middle East and North African countries, including direct aid and loan finance for investment, but conditional on respect for human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, our political parties here in this House must share their experience in order to establish secular, democratic choices for the people of that region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we are always trying to keep pace with what is happening and responding to things event by event, and in doing so we are losing some of our perspective on the situation as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that every case is different, and every country that we are discussing here is a specific case, but forgive me for saying, Baroness Ashton, that it seems to me that it is difficult to discern the criteria that the European Union has been using for its actions in each case. I am afraid that we are often hostage to the interests of the Member States, or rather some of the Member States, but not all of them. That is why we have used and continue to use the phrase ‘double standards’ so much. Sometimes it is ‘yes’ to sanctions, sometimes ‘no’; sometimes intervention extends to bombing, as in the case of Libya, while sometimes the response is total silence, as in the case of the invasion of Bahrain by Saudi Arabian forces. Baroness Ashton, let me say that I have studied all the cases carefully and I have not seen a single declaration from the European institutions condemning the invasion of Bahrain by Saudi Arabian forces.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people being sentenced to death, non-stop violence, and doctors and nurses sentenced to up to 30 years in prison by a military tribunal because they were supposedly acting against the regime and should not have helped the injured who needed their aid. We have responded to the dictatorial monarchy in Bahrain and the dictatorial regime in Yemen – the Saleh regime – with far more silence than action. I am not in favour of intervention – I never have been – but I fear that, seen from the outside, we are putting ourselves in an untenable position when, instead of assisting the development, and democratic and revolutionary aspirations of the peoples of the Arab countries, and helping the Arab Spring, we are hindering its progress either by too much action or by too little, and I do not believe that this state of affairs should be allowed to continue.</p>

<p class="contents">Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms.</p>

<p class="contents">Concerning Yemen, where the situation is deteriorating, full military force is now being used against peaceful protestors, yet the resolution passed in the UN fails to form any conclusion about responsibility for rights violations or to back the High Commissioner’s request to establish a presence in that country. We must heed, too, the new evidence from the World Food Programme of the starvation and hunger affecting that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Syria, we should note the formation of the new opposition Syrian National Council and that the High Commissioner again called for referrals to the International Criminal Court, which were not backed in the UN. Interestingly, Egypt, as well as Russia and China, sought to obstruct the commission of inquiry that was set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Egypt, I join with others in this debate to condemn the violence, with witness statements showing that security forces opened fire on protestors and ran them over in armoured cars. I myself have told the Egyptian Ambassador that I was present in Cairo for the constitutional referendum and welcomed the warmth and affection shown by people experiencing their first taste of genuine democracy, so I just do not accept that public opposition is a barrier to the EU mounting an electoral mission which could help entrench that democracy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would hope that Vice-President/High Representative Ashton will also comment, in her winding-up, on the report from Amnesty International which states that peaceful protestors outside Syrian embassies in our own countries – France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK – have been threatened, intimidated and physically attacked by individuals believed to be connected to the Syrian regime. In the UN, we can do better to protect civilians in the Arab World. Here in the European Union itself, we have no excuse not to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

High Representative, I believe that this week’s statements on Bahrain, Syria and the violence in Egypt were very good, but what actions will now back up those words? The EU can seek stronger overlap between values and interests, but not if it continues to navel-gaze or fragment.</p>
<p class="contents">We should leverage the impact of our single market to make it work for stability, growth and the defence of human rights. Obama has announced oil sanctions for Syria. While the EU is Syria’s main trading partner, it was unable to unite or to lead in this issue. Looking inward also hurts our relationship with Turkey, while we need to cooperate and engage on North Africa and the Middle East in a more intensive way.</p>
<p class="contents">We are largely failing our neighbours and the next generation, and with that our own interests. The Arab Spring is turning into a winter and we must stand more closely with those people and their future. In Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is behaving no differently than the Mubarak regime was. Citizens are tried in military courts for blogging – like Maikel Nabil – or for speaking out – like Asmaa Mahfouz. What concrete actions will the EU take to invest in a truly new Egypt?</p>
<p class="contents">In Syria, an illegitimate government continues to kill people, and there are now threats to Europe concerning that might happen to us if we recognise the Opposition Council. Those threats were made, Mr Pöttering, by the Grand Mufti, and Syrians in the EU are also facing threats. It is up to the Syrian people to determine their own future, but we must protect their human rights and we are not doing enough. More pressure, and giving a clear choice to the economic elites that doing business with al-Assad means no business with Europe would be a good start. Let me specifically highlight the need to ban the export of surveillance, security and censoring technologies to countries that use them to violate human rights. In Bahrain, the prosecution of doctors in military courts for treating people indiscriminately shows disregard for human life. The world unitedly condemns that in the strongest terms. I also wanted to highlight the case of two bloggers that are imprisoned in Bahrain – Abduljalil al-Singace and Ali Abdulemam. Please highlight their cases too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not because we are fighting tyranny in those countries – it is the peoples of the countries themselves that are doing that – but because we have a stronger enemy to fight, namely, our own past of complicity and collaboration with authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the case with Syria where, only a little while ago, we were working to open up relations with the regime and its police state, where we did not do enough to help the refugees in the country, and where we are not doing enough now to put pressure on Turkey to recognise refugees arriving in Turkey from Syria. It is also the case with Egypt, where we are once again stumbling into the same trap of falling into the arms of the military because of potential sectarian violence. It is important to investigate exactly what has happened, because the military regime may have a hand in the sectarian violence in Egypt and across the Arabian Peninsula, in Bahrain and Yemen; and frankly, Baroness Ashton, much more is needed than simply calling up the Ambassador of Bahrain. The Ambassador of Bahrain had the nerve to tell us, in this House, that the doctors being detained were not arrested for treating protestors, but for being in the hospital outside office hours. It is also necessary to speak with Saudi Arabia, and that is much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude by saying one last thing: it was the Arab Spring that brought about the release of the soldier Gilad Shalit, which you welcomed, Baroness Ashton: you should also have welcomed the release of Marwan Barghouti and of more than 1 000 Palestinians. The Arab Spring is bringing about change in that part of the world and is our greatest challenge at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must act quickly and unequivocally on this. Our economic and political support should be clearly directed only at democratic forces. We must oppose the references to sharia law in the Egyptian Constitution. Elections in Egypt should be held after changes have been made to the constitution and should last for one day across the whole country in order to avoid falsification and intimidation. Our silence on these matters will mean tacit consent to anti-Christian religious cleansing and to Egypt being engulfed by radicalism and destabilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Madam High Representative, as Chair of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I wholeheartedly join you in expressing good wishes to the parents of Gilad Shalit, now that he will shortly be released after five years of imprisonment and total isolation. That makes this a day to remember.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Egyptian newspaper <span class="italic">Al-Masry Al-Youm</span> has touchingly and accurately reported on the totally unexpected bloodbath involving peaceful Christian protesters which was caused by the Egyptian army on Sunday evening in Cairo. In a telephone conversation last night, I learned of the deep shock of the Copts and Christians of other denominations. In post-Mubarak Egypt, the government’s appalling failure to protect these people from the aggression of militant Islamists has already become a shocking fact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the future prospects of Egyptian Christians could become still grimmer. We have evidence of that from the ominous events of the beginning of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam High Representative, it is my hope that you will make every effort to ensure a genuinely independent and thorough public investigation into Sunday evening’s terrifying, deadly escalation of violence. At the same time, I expect the European Union to take a strong, clear position against the frequent daily social discrimination against the Christian minority in Egypt.

This community has been trying to reach us by various means and tell us what is going on there. I have received photographs, for example, from this community – there are only 30 young girls here who have disappeared and whose whereabouts are not known. These communities say the girls have been kidnapped, and they say there are more cases like this. However, we are also faced with this recent massacre, which confirms that the situation for these minorities in Egypt is deteriorating. On the other hand, elections are to be held there very soon, and we are also sure that a new constitution is going to be drafted too.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is a moment at which we parliamentarians – as an international community and as the European Parliament – should react, so that the changes which are taking place there meet our expectations of those new democracies. If we are to support them, we should support them in a way which ensures that standards concerning minorities – and they are indigenous minorities – are also respected. This applies to all the countries about which Ms Ashton spoke today.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the opinion that tragic events should not slow down the progress of democracy in Egypt or in other countries in the region. However, if we do not react as an international community, it will be very difficult to achieve the standards we expect there. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will concentrate on Bahrain because I travelled to Bahrain a few weeks ago with a number of Irish medics and with the human rights organisation, Front Line.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific connection was that a number of the medics who had been imprisoned had trained in Ireland and worked in Dublin. The Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin also have a huge facility in Bahrain and indeed they trained many of the doctors who were imprisoned. In this context, I believe the College of Surgeons cannot continue to sit on the fence because they must do something about the totally unacceptable breaches of medical neutrality. They have a duty of care to their former students and also to the medical profession as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to echo your words, Vice-President/High Representative, when you say that the civilian courts should now move to drop all charges. The Bahraini authorities cannot seek to legitimise the entire process simply by changing from military to civilian courts. Yes, it may look positive, and it is, but only on the surface. The arrests of the medics and the subsequent and well supported allegations of torture, with no access to family members or to legal advisers, cannot be legitimised, and all charges must be dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the situation where there are at least 80 people who remain in prison. Furthermore I would like to draw your attention to an extremely serious situation where a number of prisoners, including a man called Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, are on hunger strike. Again, I mention Abdulhadi because he worked with the Front Line human rights organisation in Dublin and was arrested when he returned to Bahrain. He is on hunger strike protesting at the severe mistreatment of a number of women who protested in the City Centre Mall. Vice-President/High Representative Ashton, I agree with you: real dialogue and real reforms are the only ways to achieve a long-term, sustainable solution in Bahrain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will cast serious doubts on the democratic prospects for Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Copts are among the oldest inhabitants of this ancient country and they participated actively, and in a spirit of solidarity, in demonstrations that put an end to the previous regime. The Egyptian revolution is – as you put it, Baroness Ashton – owned by all its citizens, including Copts. Now our External Action Service has to address this problem in a very forceful way, and I think we need to remind the new regimes that the basic criterion for democracy remains the establishment of secular constitutionalism. We need to indicate clearly that founding the constitutions of the revolutionary Arab countries on Sharia law is bound to legalise ongoing discrimination and the persecution of minorities. Democracy and human rights will not triumph if the constitutional starting point for the new regimes is fundamentally tilted in favour of a single dominant tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now discussing North Africa and, more specifically, certain countries in North Africa. The Coptic minority group is found in Egypt, but we know that there are more minority groups, and it is important that we do not only talk about this on one occasion but that this voice is heard continuously and relentlessly. This is, incidentally, also what is required and expected of us by the Treaty of Lisbon. Human rights and freedoms are not something that we should impose on these countries, but rather something that should elevate them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also cannot help but recall what happened when Saudi troops were called into Bahrain. It was actually embarrassing, not to mention shameful, to see the Saudi troops and the tanks come in and mow down people who had a hunger and thirst for freedom, in view of the fact that it was us in the West, if by the West we mean the US and Europe, that had equipped these troops with tanks and weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">We did this because we put stability before democracy, and I believe that this has to be a lesson for us going forward: not to attach so much importance to stability that we accept the trampling underfoot of democracy or that democracy is not called attention to loudly and clearly enough. That is something that we have not done, but that must now be given consideration and be the order of the day in future, too.

Political action is required. I would like to ask you to issue a strong warning to the Egyptian leader that European support will be strictly conditional on securing genuine religious freedom, and that Islamisation accompanied by attacks on the Copts is a crime against which EU leaders must come out strongly, rejecting a relativistic approach.

I think there is a very clear message coming out from this Parliament tonight concerning the fundamental relationship between the countries in transition and their people and the need to protect human rights. In that context, I am pleased to associate myself with all that has been said about the need to ensure that freedom of expression and freedom of religion and belief should be at the heart of the values held in each of the countries we have been discussing this evening – especially so in the light of the difficult situations and the violence we have seen in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with what has been said about the need to continue our engagement with civil society in the four countries we have been discussing this evening. That is something that we put – and that I put – at the forefront of the work of our delegations and of my own work. It is an enormous pleasure to meet those brave people, many of them women, who have been at the forefront of change and who are seeking the kind of society and the kind of freedoms they see that we in the European Union enjoy. We know that, if we can work collaboratively with them, we can help to engage in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, as I said earlier tonight, that there is a very special role for this House to play in that process, and I urge all the honourable Members to take up that challenge too, and be willing to engage with civil society – engage with those looking for a new political process, engage with those who are looking for what I have described as ‘deep democracy’ – and offer them your support.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that, in our new strategy for our neighbourhood, the ideas of mutual accountability and ‘more for more’ are really significant. They enable us to support those moving forward on reform, those in civil society and those local organisations and ordinary people who are willing their leadership on to change, and also to support those who are privileged to serve in leadership positions who likewise choose to move forward with reform, to support the economy and the kind of democratic institutions and deep democracy that we wish to see, and to keep that idea of accountability in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">We are responsible to the people for delivering what we say we will deliver; those in leadership are responsible for doing what they said they were going to do; and that mutual accountability should, I believe, govern the relationship we have with these countries across our neighbourhood into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have put out 11 statements on Bahrain, I have put out a number of statements on other countries, and I understand the frustration of feeling that sometimes we use words when we need to seek action. That is also why we need to keep working in the Human Rights Council and in the Security Council, supporting our colleagues in civil society who are seeking change, and making not just statements but also contacts and links in order to say what we know to be true. In Bahrain, that means saying that those who offer medical care should be treated as the heroes and heroines they are, and should not be treated badly by the regime. In Syria, it means saying that those who are trying to come together to provide alternative leadership need to be supported in doing so. In Yemen, it means saying that those who wish to see President Saleh finally do what he said he would also need to be supported, not just with the humanitarian aid we have provided, but also with the full range of support which we can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that honourable Members are concerned about the situation in this region and especially in Egypt, a country that has all the potential to be a true and great democracy. It has the potential to throw off the shackles of the past 30 years and grow into the kind of country that the people who stood together day after day in Tahrir Square – people of all faiths, all beliefs and all views, men and women, young and old – have fought for. That is what we have to help the people of Egypt actually to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent attacks against the Christian community in Egypt are an added cause for concern. They are indicative of the far-reaching turmoil still prevalent in this society. Resorting to violence is not the way to rebuild a state on democratic foundations. I regard the Egyptian army’s response to the peaceful demonstration of Coptic Christians as a dangerous show of force. Inter-religious tensions may destabilise Egypt and the whole region. To avoid them, it is the Egyptian authorities’ duty to cast some light on these incidents. Clarification is also required of the role played by national television, which deliberately broadcast erroneous information, resulting in a deterioration of the situation.

In fact, awarding this prestigious prize to these activists supporting women’s rights is a mark of recognition and a boost for the active role they have adopted, in spite of the risks, in promoting the notion of a peaceful and just society. Unfortunately, more than 40 women were injured in Yemen on Sunday during a demonstration celebrating the award of the Nobel Prize to their compatriot. This is a show of primitive aggression which is indicative of the climate of violence and terror in which Yemeni women are living.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly condemn attacks like this, and I call on the European Union to take a tougher line in defending human rights, including those of women. Such action highlights that there is more to the situation in Yemen than President Saleh giving up power.

Their crimes were no more than to treat injured demonstrators who were brought to the hospital, and to protest to the Minister of Health at the refusal to send ambulances to collect the injured. There are also serious and credible allegations of torture. Among the doctors and nurses currently on trial are three doctors who studied at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dr Ali Al Ekri, Dr Basim Daif and Dr Ghassan Daif. All three were arbitrarily detained, held incommunicado in detention, reportedly tortured, denied access to their families for two months and forced to ‘confess’ under duress. These ‘confessions’ were videotaped while they were blindfolded and are being used in evidence against them. The EU must do everything in its power to ensure that the Bahraini authorities: release all human rights defenders currently in detention; drop the charges against all 47 doctors, nurses and technicians; overturn the conviction of human rights defenders; end the unfair trials; and bring those responsible for torture to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also complain of the government’s refusal to increase the minimum wage and impose a maximum income, at the same time as it is raising prices and insisting on selling national resources such as gas cheaply.

After 1939, he was responsible for mass deportations and executions of Polish, Czech, and later French and Balkan Jews. He is notorious for his role as executioner of Slovakian and Bulgarian Jews. He was wanted by the international bodies after the war but escaped punishment for his crimes against humanity. Alois Brunner managed to hide in Syria where he set about creating and building the Assad regime’s security forces. A Nazi criminal, responsible for murdering hundreds of thousands of Europeans, was the founding father of the forces that are now bringing bloodshed to the streets of Hims, Hama, Damascus, Latakia and many other Syrian towns and cities. Repressions and brutal torture are used against the old and the young, men and women alike. Having regained a new city, the army proceeds to cleanse it by capturing those involved in protests. Many of those arrested will never come back, and the bodies which have been found have been stripped of internal organs, which are cut out for the organ trade. According to Israeli sources, the organs are then transported to transplant centres in Turkey. In response to events in Syria, the entire European Union must speak today with one voice – that of condemnation. When demonstrations were going on in Libya, the decision to establish a no-fly zone was taken rapidly. However, while the Assad regime is murdering Syrian people, the world is silent and looks away. Europe must aim for peace in Syria at any cost and exert pressure on President Assad to introduce reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands of people have lost their lives in riots, and even more have been injured. At present, the situation leaves no doubt as to the brutal nature of the conflict, as is illustrated by an incident which took place a few days ago, in which men paid by the President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, used stones and bottles to attack a rally celebrating the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Yemeni journalist, Tawakkul Karman, leaving 40 women injured.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of emergency declared in both countries is interfering with the functioning of these states at all levels. Human rights are being violated. Therefore, it is imperative that a solution to the conflict between the authorities and the opposition is reached. Peace must be established and a settlement between the parties needs to be agreed. The government’s attacks against the civilian population must be brought to an end. I call on the Yemeni and Bahraini authorities to resolve the conflict peacefully and to respect the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Al-Qaeda’s activities in these territories are also of concern, such as the attack on Yemen’s defence minister, the commander of a military offensive against al-Qaeda. The fight to oppose terrorism and bring security to this part of the world should be conducted with full respect for the principles of human rights. We should call for an end to arbitrary beatings and arrests. The European Union can play a significant role here by stressing the need for effective implementation of a variety of political initiatives aimed at supporting pro-democratic reform in Arab countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, trends in recent months, such as the arrest of civilians and the fact that they are being prosecuted before military tribunals, the recent clash with Christian protesters and attacks on the Israeli embassy, demonstrate that tension is growing. Consciously or not, the division of Egypt is escalating. The current leadership must guarantee the fundamental rights of all Egyptians, including religious minorities, and address the issue of tension among religious communities. We must find out who was responsible for the deaths of 25 protesters in the recent clashes and prosecute those guilty. The special situation in Egypt still applies, with restrictions on the media and freedom of association. Unfortunately, under such conditions, it is hard to imagine the country being ready for democratic elections.

As regards Yemen, I believe that the main problem is the extremely strong terrorist threat present there, to which uprisings aimed at taking over the country promise no solution. I urge the European Union to take prompt diplomatic action in order to resolve the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The treatment meted out to the Syrian, Yemeni and Bahraini people has both shocked and moved me. I am therefore pleased that the Vice-President of the Commission has officially denounced the attitude of the local authoritarian regimes, who are clearly in disarray in the face of the popular uprising. The bloody repression of peaceful protests and the arbitrary imprisonment of members of the opposition shows the irresponsibility of these leaders. The Union cannot tolerate such attacks on its core values being committed with impunity. We must therefore make sure that all those suspected of human rights violations are held accountable for their actions. I urge the Union to support the transition to democracy in the Middle East so as to uphold the legitimate aspirations of its people. To this end, I welcome the position of European States lobbying the UN to adopt a Security Council resolution on the matter. It is time we put our commitment to supporting people wanting democracy into action instead of promoting the stability of regimes which continue to deny it.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, I have no doubt that everyone in this House will join me in expressing condemnation about the verdict against Yulia Tymoshenko pronounced in Ukraine yesterday. I issued a strong statement on behalf of the European Union at that time and I fully share the views that were expressed in President Buzek’s statement at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko was politically motivated. Her conviction yesterday followed a trial which did not respect international standards as regards a fair, transparent and independent legal process. Regrettably, her case is not an isolated one in the Ukraine. Several other members of her government have been prosecuted and convicted in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">These judicial proceedings have been criticised not just by Ukraine’s partners, but by independent monitors and experts. This is not acceptable for a country which holds the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe, or for a country which claims to share our fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">Selective and politically motivated justice is not the European way. Governments are accountable to their electorates and their political decisions should be judged through the ballot box, not through the courts. This principle is a cornerstone of our democracies. There is absolute unity among the Member States of the European Union that the Ukrainian authorities must allow for swift and comprehensive appeals, without limitations to the right to stand in the parliamentary elections next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I was interested to see that President Yanukovych has expressed unhappiness with the Criminal Code in Ukraine and recognises the need for change, but frankly, that is not enough. It does not excuse the authorities from the responsibility to guarantee a process which is fully in line with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine also needs to press ahead with critical reforms to the constitution and adopt an electoral law which reflects a cross-party consensus in parliament. A level playing field is essential if we are to see credibility and confidence restored in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2011 was to have been one of unparalleled opportunity and development in EU-Ukraine relations. Our aim was to sign an association agreement, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area, by the end of the year. That agreement has been conceived not as a gift to Ukraine, or a gift to Europe, but as a mutually beneficial contract sharing our values and standards, opening our markets, modernising and diversifying the Ukrainian economy, and entrenching the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. It would have been the first of its kind under the renewed European Neighbourhood Policy and the reinvigorated Eastern Partnership, whose leaders, as honourable Members know, met only 10 days ago in Warsaw and reconfirmed their commitment to closer political association based on these common values.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the offer of concluding an association agreement should remain on the table. Yulia Tymoshenko herself asked us to carry on with the technical work on the association agreement. Both citizens in the European Union and in Ukraine stand to benefit, and it offers the Ukrainian Government the road map for transformation that the country needs. So I believe that we should not walk away from the technical negotiations but continue with the aim of having before us on the table a document which makes it clear to both sides what is possible – and also what could be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">But we can only sign such an agreement if we are convinced that the Ukrainian leadership believes in the values on which it is based, and is committed to upholding. It is clear that this House would not accept such an agreement if it did not have this conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, I will be meeting both President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, and Ukraine is on our agenda. Of course we will review the contacts with Ukraine, including those political dialogues, and continue to send the clear messages to the leadership on the systemic problem they need to face in re-establishing the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As friends of the Ukrainian people, we owe it to them to spare no effort to help Ukrainian leaders take the right decisions. It is clear to us what they are and I believe it is also clear to the people of Ukraine what they are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sentencing of former Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, must be condemned. Her trial is politically motivated and did not meet even minimal European standards. Ukraine’s European aspirations require that it practise European values of democracy and the rule of law. That is not currently what is happening there.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Ukraine Government continues on its path of sabotaging political opposition and abusing power, it will put the country’s economic and European prospects at risk. Yulia Tymoshenko should be acquitted and released, and should enjoy full political and civic rights as of now. The verdict, if it is not annulled, will have consequences for the implementation of the EU-Ukraine stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement should be completed and the document should be initialled as planned under the Polish Presidency in December. Subsequently, its signature and ratification could be declined if no changes take place in Ukraine. Ukraine will thus be made aware of what it might lose. More importantly, however, the Union will, at the same time, be sending a positive signal to Ukraine as a nation and to its people who have legitimate European aspirations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ukraine needs to be conscious of the direction in which it wants to go. If it wants to take the path towards Europe, then there are certain preconditions attached to this – namely, acceptance of the principles of our system of law and the implementation of these.</p>
<p class="contents">My group rejects any kind of criminal trial or legal proceedings that would appear to be based on political persecution. If attempts are made to prosecute Mr Gyurcsány in Hungary, then we suspect that things are happening there that are not entirely in accordance with our legal standards. If we criticise that, then we cannot accept what is currently happening in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a common legal position which sets out that trials must take place according to proper European principles and not as an act of revenge by a government. Everyone in this House knows that we are trying to maintain good working relationships, particularly with the Ukrainian Party of Regions, and that we are giving very strong support to Ukraine’s efforts to take a European path. We will do everything possible to ensure that this can be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also agree with Mr Saryusz-Wolski that we should continue the negotiations. However, our group will send a clear signal to Kiev that this is not the way to put the relationship between the European Union and Ukraine on a better footing and move it to a higher level.

The European Union has a lot to work on in its relationship with the countries south of the Mediterranean. For far too long, dictators have been respected by us and given our unconditional cooperation. However, we should assess what we are currently doing in respect of Ukraine in the light of this responsibility and the negative experience that Arab peoples have had of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am emphatically in favour of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine – and I say that on behalf of my group. This agreement could really serve to put our social and economic relations on a more stable footing and improve the lives of the people of Ukraine. I am firmly convinced that the people of Ukraine have really fought for and deserve this association agreement through their commitment to democratic development. It is extremely regrettable that the case of Yulia Tymoshenko is now putting pressure on relations between the European Union and Ukraine – which had, in fact, improved. However, that is the way it has to be, for the reasons agreed on by all the previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to go beyond this, however, and point out that it is not just Ms Tymoshenko who faces court proceedings, but also some of the members of her former government. I would like to point out that before these proceedings were initiated, hundreds of judges and public prosecutors in Ukraine were replaced. That is not what I understand by democratic reform of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that Ukraine still does not have a truly good and independent media sector, and that it is very difficult to guarantee diversity of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because of all this that we have to take a tough line now. Yes, we will continue to negotiate, but we will also make it clear that our signing of the agreement – the European Union’s approval of the association agreement – in fact depends on democratic developments in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Tymoshenko belongs to the family of Christian democratic parties in Europe. With his Party of Regions, President Yanukovych has observer status among the social democrats in Europe. I feel that both party families have a great responsibility to now ensure that relations between government and opposition forces are based on democratic principles. As far as I am concerned, bringing this about is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There may indeed be various grounds for condemning Ms Tymoshenko, but does she really deserve to go to prison? She has not been convicted of corruption, for example; instead, she has been convicted on account of the content of the gas deal, which is allegedly disadvantageous for Ukraine. It is precisely for this reason that her politically motivated sentence is incompatible with our legal principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The sentence passed against Ms Tymoshenko is all too clearly a blow intended to annihilate her politically and a pretext for the termination of the gas contract. President Yanukovych may have excluded a political opponent as a result, but he has certainly done his country a disservice. Firstly, the sentence is clearly seen by Moscow as being anti-Russian – that is clear – and, because of its dependence on gas, Kiev has no choice but to come to an arrangement with Russia. Secondly, Ukraine must be aware that the sentence will put negotiations with the EU under strain.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU therefore needs to consider carefully whether the association agreement really has to be put on ice as a protest; if so, we have to accept that this would be a setback for the Eastern Partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The members of our group who have been encouraging this country to adopt a European perspective, and who even did not rule out membership in the long term, are particularly appalled.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who currently hold political power in Kiev and the people behind them evidently do not share our European values. Applying criminal sanctions to political decisions with the aim of destroying the opposition is not acceptable. Ms Tymoshenko could also have taken legal proceedings against President Yanukovych back in 2004 for electoral fraud. She did not do so; instead, she engaged with him politically.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso should adopt a clear position when dealing with President Yanukovych next week. We cannot sign an agreement with a partner when the text of the agreement departs so blatantly from the reality in that country. This is the reality today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to suppose at present that those in power in Kiev, and the Firtashs and Khoroshkovskys of that country, will be bothered in the future by the detailed rules of the association and free trade agreement. They will continue to instigate arbitrary court proceedings, to use the country’s institutions for partisan and oligarchical purposes, and to place obstacles in the way of our investors, so that they can control things within their own circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless Kiev takes specific steps by next week to bring about a European standard of rule of law, then President Barroso should consider whether he actually has enough to talk about with President Yanukovych.

A situation in which everyone has their own firmly held views on which they are unwilling to compromise? For the Ukrainian authorities are correct to some extent when they say they are fighting corruption and that they suspect their former prime minister, the opposition leader, of committing serious corruption offences. We, however, are also correct in saying that it is completely unacceptable to imprison the leader of the opposition and seven of her former ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">While we all stand firmly by our reasons, the momentous historical process of bringing Ukraine closer to the European Union through the association agreement is being pushed aside. It is my opinion that in this difficult situation, which seems to be lacking any agreement, we should persist in our efforts. The EU should not be an institution which closes its doors. I therefore believe that it is all the more sensible and necessary to receive and speak with President Yanukovych in Brussels, and to inform him of all the reasons behind our position.</p>
<p class="contents">If, at the end of this process, the association agreement is not signed for some reason, then the greatest winner and the person most satisfied with such an outcome would be the one sitting in the Kremlin, since in this case, the true victor would be the Russian national interest.

A discussion was being held in the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the Ukrainian minister, Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, who was trying to persuade the members of the Committee that the Ukrainian judiciary is independent, just at the time when the news broke that former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, had been sentenced to seven years in prison. This is a slightly surreal situation, only serving to remind us of the type of trial and holding to account practised in the time of Stalin. In fact, quite a few commentators have described Yulia Tymoshenko’s trial as Stalinist.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if things stay as they are, I wonder why we need to continue doing what we have been doing for a good few months. We said what we are saying today at the time of Yulia Tymoshenko’s arrest. Yanukovych was not at all receptive to this message. Therefore, why should we raise the issue of continuing negotiations for an association agreement when one of the partners involved is actually a Stalinist?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the association agreement negotiations must be stopped. Only a very clear political message like this can make Yanukovych understand our position. The reason for this is that, otherwise, if we continue to have these discussions and say: ‘let us meet Yanukovych and explain it to him once again’, I am afraid that he will hoodwink us just like Stalin hoodwinked some of the Western politicians for absolutely years on end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It casts a shadow on all efforts made by the current government to bring the country closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The seven-year prison sentence for Ms Tymoshenko rightly provoked an outrage throughout the EU and its Member States. However, against the political correctness, I want to be honest in this debate, and I am speaking on my own behalf here.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the sentencing of Ms Tymoshenko really political revenge, or was it really an end to impunity in Ukraine? Was the sentence of seven years a shocking abuse of the law, or can we simply not imagine the scale of the abuse of power and the damage to the country? When we call for a fair and objective trial, do we really mean that, or do we mean ‘release Tymoshenko’? For me, the answers to these questions are not self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us put aside the emotions, let us not be too quick in rejecting the EU aspirations of the Ukraine. Let us help both the government and Ms Tymoshenko find a solution so that the rule of law is preserved but the political process and the next elections are not called into question. I call on the President Yanukovych to take the situation seriously and to respond adequately to our concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to address President Yanukovych. Mr President, you have an opportunity to make history, either as someone who signed a vitally important agreement with the European Union, crucial to the future of your people, or as a person whose name will join that of Alexander Lukashenko in the dark chapters of history, since what has happened to Yulia Tymoshenko is not a far cry from what goes on in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to address those who are sometimes described as having enormous influence in Ukrainian politics, Mr Akhmetov and Mr Firtash. Gentlemen, you are wrong in thinking that you can do business with the EU and western enterprises and, at the same time, support and condone this type of violation of the basic rules of democracy. We will remember what you have been doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to address the judge, Mr Kireyev, who handed down the sentence.

Calls to that effect have already been voiced by many concerned representatives of the EU, including members of this House. I would like to recall the European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2011, which, in recital A, states that the EU favours a stable and democratic Ukraine that respects the principles of the rule of law, the protection of minorities and human rights, and that guarantees fundamental rights as well as fair, impartial and independent legal processes.

This cannot be allowed to happen on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of Ukraine’s closest friends and I sincerely want to see the country move closer to the European Union. However, the actions of President Yanukovych are doing a great disservice to his people by jeopardising Ukraine’s deep and comprehensive free trade area and visa liberalisation agreements. Yanukovych foolishly believes that this kind of neo-Soviet behaviour, using Stalin-era legislation, is acceptable in the modern era.</p>
<p class="contents">I last saw Yulia Tymoshenko earlier this year and she was very concerned about her future. The world will now be watching to ensure that she is treated humanely and that her right to appeal is honoured by the judicial system, which is clearly not independent in Ukraine.</p>

Let us remember that it is not only Hungary, but also France where a former Head of State is facing trial. Other examples I could quote are Iceland or Croatia. Ukraine has demonstrated on several occasions recently that it is not only lacking as regards its judicial system, but also in the area of human rights, as persons belonging to minorities, who are neither former Heads of State nor prime ministers, but ordinary Ukrainian citizens, have been deprived of their right to use their native language in education and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Where I do advise my fellow Members to draw parallels is that the EU can only take effective and credible action against Ukraine if, within its own area, within the area of the European Union, Member States abolish anti-minority laws that prejudice collective rights, and if they do away with provisions in the form of language laws and other discriminative legal acts that punish EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The critical thing for Ukraine now is to take seriously the need to move on what we have been saying about the need for a fair, transparent and independent legal process.

<p class="contents">I hope that we will see a swift appeals process that will enable that to be the basis upon which decisions are made by the courts.

I will just echo one, which is that we know that it is in the interests of the people of Ukraine to move forward with an association agreement with us and to take forward the values which we hold dear and which the members of the Ukrainian Government claim to wish to see as well.

Despite the fact that the other opposition leader committed grave errors impacting the Ukrainian economy, the EU must be prepared to provide assistance and take steps to help modernise the legal system and strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine. There have also been doubts as to the transparency and impartiality of this trial. We in the European Parliament must not treat the situation in Ukraine lightly – and nor are we treating it lightly in fact. Just as it is important to make an effort to avoid the occurrence of similar situations in the future, it is also important to ensure a fair judicial process with a modernised and impartial judiciary, and not a process marred by political interference.

We respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and understand that disparities exist between the legal systems in various countries. At the same time, it is difficult to comprehend and accept the verdict against the former prime minister. One of our Lithuanian colleagues stated that if purchasing Russian natural gas at excessive prices was a punishable offence, then a number of former Lithuanian prime ministers should be imprisoned. Concerns as to the political motives behind the verdict are widespread in Europe. I therefore call on the Ukrainian authorities to consider all potential solutions which might provide a way out of a situation that is embarrassing for all involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with what the High Representative and some of the previous speakers said in their speeches and see a clear political motive behind the sentence. The European Union must now ask itself to what extent such action can promote relations between the EU and Ukraine. If Ukraine continues down the road on which it has embarked and turns its back on the values and principles of a common Europe, this will not help to bring the two parties closer together. The position of the EU on this is, and must be, clear. The events surrounding Yulia Tymoshenko will certainly influence the negotiations regarding an association agreement and a trade agreement, there is no doubt about that. However, we should not go so far as to declare the negotiations terminated before they have begun. That would be the wrong signal to send out. I agree with the approach advocated by Mr Saryusz-Wolski of continuing the negotiations to their conclusion. Ratification could then wait. One of the basic principles of the EU is respect for the rule of law. We must defend this without any ifs and buts and also demand it from our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must send a strong, well-coordinated message to the Ukrainian authorities concerning respect for the separation of state powers. The current climate in Kiev may have serious repercussions on relations between the EU and Ukraine, looking ahead to the signing of an association agreement. It is important that the government in Kiev commits to a process of transition to democracy and, by extension, to the European Union.</p>

The ever-growing number of investigations being carried out into prominent political leaders, members of Ukraine’s political opposition, casts serious doubts over the impartiality of these inquiries.</p>

While employees throughout Europe are being hit extremely hard by policies of austerity, which do not spare Hungary either, the Hungarian Government is making matters worse: it has launched an assault against employees’ rights. Preparations for the new Hungarian labour law regulations are proceeding behind the scenes in a non-transparent manner and without any official consultations with the social partners, which is contrary to European norms. By contrast, it comes as no surprise that the draft EU Working Time Directive is being written by the European social partners.

A group of young people from various parts of Europe met in Brussels as part of the protest movements, and Members of this House invited us to meet with them and discuss their ideas. What then happened was that, at the European Parliament’s request, Belgian anti-riot police and Parliament’s own security forces mounted a totally disproportionate action to prevent these young people from entering. Such strict security meant that only seven of them met the criteria enabling them to come in and say what they came to say. I do not understand this measure and must express my outrage, Madam President. Parliament is a seat of democracy and it should not be afraid of the people. After all, where was the threat in this case? Are those who think differently from the dominant way of thinking in Parliament a threat? This is not what we call a ‘threat’, it is what we call ‘the wealth of democracy’, and I hope that we will all share a real sense of outrage on 15 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This international institution has rejected moves to reform the judiciary. It criticises the method of selecting judges by commissions that are wholly under the control of the governing coalition. It criticises the transfer of the right to submit proposals for disciplinary action against judges to the minister, as well as the criticism of judicial decisions by representatives of Slovak executive and legislative power. The resolution puts the current Slovak Government to shame. Even though the Slovak Parliament yesterday expressed its lack of confidence in the government and we face early elections, the Commission should respond. The constitutional court’s suspension of the law on the office of public prosecutor, which was intended to bring the independent prosecutor completely under the control of the minister, also deserves a response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we have seen that, as part of centralising the targets set for each Member State, which were established by them within their national reform programmes in April this year, it is stated that the results for the reduction in the number of people exposed to the risk of poverty cannot be calculated at European Union level due to differences in the methodologies used by Member States.</p>

The report ignores one of the most problematic aspects, namely, the property restitution act passed by Belgrade in September. The act, which is otherwise of particular importance, includes a provision on restitution, which appears to strengthen the principle of collective culpability and collective liability as opposed to individual liability. However, as we know, the cornerstone of the European justice system is individual liability. Unfortunately, this fact has apparently passed unnoticed by the Commission. According to the provisions, all persons who were part of the occupying forces stationed in Serbia during World War II, as well as their successors, are excluded from the scope of the act irrespective of whether any form of individual liability can be proven in their case or not.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is, almost the entirety of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, who had been drafted against their will and under coercion, have been excluded. This passage of the act sheds a negative light on Serbia and will definitely hinder its acquisition of candidate status, but, at the same time, it also calls into question the Commission’s attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She regrets that she cannot be here because she is currently in a meeting of the Conference of Committee Chairs with the College of Commissioners – at least one of whom is here – and, of course, the issues covered by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs weigh heavily at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, to increase the callable capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), is another example of the ECON Committee working efficiently while still subjecting the matter to proper parliamentary scrutiny. The result is a far stronger text, which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the EU shareholding in the EBRD and reinforces the reasons for, and the direction of, our involvement in this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of background, the EBRD is the first international financial institution of the post-Cold-War period and was created to support the development of market economies in eastern Europe following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. Following the Arab Spring, the international shareholders of the EBRD decided to increase the callable capital so that the bank could extend its operations into countries such as Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, the matter was considered non-controversial and the European Council did not amend the proposal. However, the committee decided that it wished to highlight and address in the text a number of issues, which have been successfully negotiated with the Council and Commission. These included emphasis on the fact that the Union’s representation in the EBRD governing bodies should encourage it to demonstrate consistency with the Europe 2020 objectives – in order to enhance the overall coherence of the Union’s external action policy – and on the importance of the EBRD publicly providing transparent information about beneficiaries and the impact of its financial intermediary operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as a result of the committee’s amendments, the Governor of the ERBD for the Union should now report annually to Parliament on the promotion of the Union’s objectives with regard to the EU’s external action policy, the Europe 2020 strategy and the significant increase in transfer to renewable, energy-efficient technologies. The Governor of the EBRD for the Union will also be required to report annually on the effectiveness of the existing system and on measures to ensure the transparency of EBRD operations through financial intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect which required considerable negotiation in the trialogue was finding wording to best describe the characteristics and activities of tax havens. The ECON Committee was keen to request not only that the text should recognise the OECD definition, but also that some more specific characteristics of tax havens were recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the EBRD will be able to use this additional callable capital to support its activities as it starts its work in Egypt and other countries following the Arab Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EBRD Board of Governors decided on a capital increase in May 2010. The authorised capital stock of the bank will increase by 50% from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion. The purpose of the proposed legislation is to allow the EU to subscribe to additional callable shares in the EBRD, in proportion with the Union’s current share in the capital, which is around 3%.</p>
<p class="contents">The text examined today is the result of interinstitutional negotiations and the Commission fully supports it. We have now reached, I would say, a very balanced decision which will allow the EU to subscribe to the capital increase in line with the decisions taken by all our Member States. As such, this would be a very strong message about EU consistency and EU commitment both to the pre-accession countries and to the Eastern and Southern Neighbourhood which, as Mr Schmidt well described, is a key strategic priority for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The EBRD activities are widely appreciated to help countries to implement economic transition. The additional capital will provide the EBRD with the necessary operational and risk-bearing capacity to sustain a high level of activity over the coming years. This is essential to continue to promote local private sector development and accompany the transition and economic recovery of the EBRD countries of operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EBRD is not only playing a key role in supporting the financial sector and SMEs, but it also plays a role in energy efficiency and security, nuclear safety and environmental and municipal infrastructure. In the current post-crisis environment, the Bank will also better integrate into its priorities important qualitative dimensions of the transition and reform agenda, such as trade integration and regional cooperation, job creation and social sustainability, resource efficiency as well as innovation and greener projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the EBRD will face a new and very important challenge with the expansion of its geographical scope to the southern and eastern Mediterranean. The Commission has supported this and we see this as a very clear political priority where the EBRD can play an important role. The Commission will thus put forward a formal proposal for a decision of the Parliament and of the Council to approve an amendment to the Agreement establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which would allow for such an expansion to the southern and eastern Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, you have a different representative addressing you now.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concerns increasing the capital stock of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion, in order to safeguard the EBRD’s AAA rating and maintain current voting rights within the EBRD. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the call for the Commission and the Member States to submit an assessment of the European public investment banking system to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important to us is the demand that the Governor of the EBRD report annually to the competent committee of the European Parliament on the promotion of the Union’s objectives, with particular regard to the EU’s Millennium Development Goals and the Europe 2020 strategy – as Mr Schmidt has already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is to be welcomed that, following the committee’s report, there must always be public disclosure of evaluations of projects and beneficiaries of the EBRD and that there will be tighter controls in future. This will prevent secrecy by beneficiaries or the use of tax havens by projects in which the bank is involved. That is very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our coordinator told me that two trialogues took place this summer. The results have the full support of our group. The PPE Group will therefore also vote in favour in this instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The decision concerning the subscription by the European Union to additional shares in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) must be accompanied by clear signals from the European Parliament to the other European institutions and Member States about the activity of this bank. This is why, first of all, I think that the European public investment banking system needs to be streamlined. The duplication and overlap of activities carried out in the EBRD and EIB must be avoided. I would like to mention, on this point, the European Parliament Resolution of 25 March 2009, calling for the European public investment banking system to be restructured, including the assessment of the option of dissolving the EBRD and incorporating its relevant sections into the European Investment Bank. We are also expecting an assessment on this to be submitted by the end of the Fourth Capital Resources Review in 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that tighter controls are required concerning the possible movement of EBRD funds via tax havens and the use of the principle of banking secrecy for the benefit of tax evasion. Distortions and shortcomings in a taxation system are mechanisms which enable certain entities to shirk their responsibilities to society. In practical terms, they sustain the state of financial instability by undermining the regulations in force, promote inequality and poverty, and restrict economic growth. A bank financed by the European Union cannot allow itself to work with such institutions. Indeed, the European Parliament clearly advocates transparency and is calling for the details of the assessments made of the projects funded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to also be disclosed to the beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity, however, to draw attention to certain problems relating to projects funded by the EBRD.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the volume of loans provided by the Bank was increased during the crisis, and its area of operation was enlarged, doubts persist as to the sustainability of its project funding. Funding is often provided for projects with negative social and environmental impacts. Also, although the EBRD has increased its funding of energy efficiency projects in recent years, it continues to invest in a completely contrasting spectrum of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to constantly increasing the volume of funding we make available to the EBRD, we should therefore, as shareholders, think about how these resources are being used. I know we will not change much in today’s debate, but I would like to call on those in authority particularly to address the quality of the EBRD’s investment strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The increase in capital also forms part of the Bank’s medium term strategy. The shareholders of the EBRD comprise 61 countries, including 29 beneficiary countries. The European Commission and the European Investment Bank also have a separate holding. My own country will also take part in increasing the capital. In February this year, the government decided to subscribe a further 3 842 shares payable on demand, and 431 paid-up shares with a value of EUR 10 000. This means, in practice, maintaining my country’s percentage share in the voting rights of the EBRD. The bank’s other shareholders have taken a similar approach, and it is good that both the European Parliament and the Council are backing this policy through their decision. The EBRD will thus secure new possibilities for expanding its investment support activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that Mr Skinner would like to see a coherent cross-border framework for consumer protection insurance, and I thank him for balancing this with much Member State discretion and respecting subsidiarity. However, I will not vote for his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of insurance is rising in many countries and in many sectors. Insurers today face low returns on asset portfolios and increased solvency requirements, but with higher claim rates and more exposure to fraud, while in some sectors, costs are added by the gold-plating of claims packages. All these costs were added even before Commissioner Reding drove headlong into the women drivers debate. We do risk insurance becoming simply unaffordable, especially for those on lower incomes, and too often the Commission will bring forward legislation that adds costs but has little real benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to wait and see what the Commission’s proposals are in this area before making a judgment. Fundamentally, what is the benefit of offering additional consumer protection for insurance products if we leave behind a raft of consumers who cannot afford to buy insurance products in the first place? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly true where there are no adequate compensation procedures in place if consumers suffer losses as a result of the failure of financial institutions. Insurance guarantee schemes can be a valuable instrument for reducing the risks that insured persons are exposed to if an insurance company fails and becomes insolvent. Insurance guarantee schemes often vary, however, as regards the cover. For this reason, there are varying levels of protection for insured parties in the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also substantial differences in other aspects influencing the scope of protection provided, and also in the operating procedures and methods of funding. In my opinion, a unified level of consumer protection should be ensured, in order to maintain consumer confidence in the insurance industry, and in the single market for financial services. Consumers could then be sure that all the types of insurance product they purchase would be covered by insurance guarantee schemes, and that these schemes would ensure 100% compensation for them within a set period of time, on a unified basis throughout the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lack of harmonisation in this sector could distort cross-border competition and hamper the provision of uniform protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania is one of the 11 Member States which currently have at least one general insurance guarantee scheme. This means that well over half of the whole EU insurance market does not enjoy effective protection. I should emphasise the need for a European legal framework to provide complete, continuous protection to the holders or, if applicable, beneficiaries of the insurance policies. At the same time, it is crucial for the funding model for national insurance guarantee schemes to comply with the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly the whole issue of insurance has come very much to mind in recent times. I have seen in my own country a rather strange situation occurring whereby wages are going down and yet the cost of insurance is going through the roof. This is true for general insurance and particularly for health insurance. As a result, many consumers cannot afford to be insured, which is not a very satisfactory position. I have also seen, in areas where flooding occurred, that the cost of insurance went up six-fold and even then, when you read the small print, very many situations have not been covered.</p>
<p class="contents">So, certainly, an impact study would be very desirable in order to establish a level playing field right across Europe, to ensure that consumers are insured and that they are insured for what they think they are being insured for and for what they are paying for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the directive does not protect consumers from losses if an insurance company fails, and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection therefore recommends that the Commission harmonise an insurance guarantee scheme through the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A unified, legally-binding framework for the protection of insurance guarantee schemes based on minimum harmonisation looks like a good starting point. Certain problems may arise in countries without insurance guarantee schemes, particularly in relation to the cross-border activities of insurers. The EU does not have harmonised consumer protection standards, and providers operating in multiple national systems in accordance with the approach of the host country would therefore have to count on higher costs. The home country principle appears for now to be a more favourable alternative to an insurance guarantee scheme covering a larger geographical area of operation. The Commission, however, should use the remaining time to evaluate the open issues so that the desired objectives can be achieved when the Solvency II Directive enters into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This diversity, however, brings considerable uncertainty for consumers, particularly in cross-border cases where it is not clearly established which rules will be applied. An insurance guarantee scheme at European level must ensure more effective protection of all insured parties in the EU, and should therefore also include a specification of adequate compensation procedures for consumers suffering losses as a result of the failure of financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft directive on insurance guarantee schemes should improve the existing deposit protection scheme, and thus help to create more homogenous conditions on the internal market in insurance. It remains a clear priority, in my opinion, to ensure equal protection for consumers regardless of the home country of the insurer, and to raise consumer awareness of the risks associated with financial service provision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report marks an important step towards a European approach to overcome the fragmented landscape within a minimum harmonisation framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the timeline, the Commission plans to approve a proposal for a directive by the end of 2012. I trust that we all agree on a number of points made in the report, such as the home state principle and the importance of providing consumers with easy and appropriate information, for instance, through a single point of contact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a few important issues on which the White Paper tabled last year presented arguments for a preliminary position of the Commission that I must recall is not exactly that of the report presented today.</p>
<p class="contents">On coverage, our position in the White Paper was that the insurance guarantee scheme should cover both life and non-life insurance policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the level of funding, the White Paper stated that it needs to be set at an appropriate target level with a suitable transition period in an EU directive. Should funding be ex-ante or ex-post? In the White Paper, our position was that insurance guarantee schemes established at national level should be all financed, at least to a certain extent, by ex-ante contributions from insurance undertakings. The Commission, however, did not exclude that, in the case of a lack of resources, ex-ante funds could possibly be complemented by ex-post funding arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, this report from Mr Skinner comes at an important time when we are preparing for a European regime for insurance guarantee schemes. We believe that it will not be too difficult in the future to find a very good common ground acceptable for both the European Parliament and the Commission. We are encouraged by the commitment shown by you in Parliament, and your report reinforces this basis for our joint work ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumers are one of the most vulnerable groups in the financial crisis and need to be reassured that their money and savings are secured. In order to effectively improve citizens’ confidence, protect consumers’ and taxpayers’ rights, and enhance market stability, European institutions must take urgent actions and build a common cross-boarder framework for IGS, without undermining the protection already offered by some Member States. The IGS should fully take into account consumer interests by providing high degrees of effective, equal and adequate levels of consumer protection. The Commission should ensure that existing legislation really benefits consumers, especially with regard to the provision of information and facilitating cross-border contact and payments. The information available to consumers in the event of an insurer’s insolvency should be easily accessible, comprehensive and easy to follow, with clear indications as to which authority the consumer should approach when making claims or enquiries. Last but not least, an appropriate target level of funding should be set, with a suitable transition period in order to guarantee that the schemes compensate consumers effectively over a wide range of circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title21"></a><a name="creitem21"></a>

Before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the national parliaments were constantly complaining that 80% of the laws they passed were actually decided by Europe; that they were simply rubber-stamping it as a kind of agent of the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon has changed that. The national parliaments play a leading role and can exert an influence. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the EU more democratic because it has given greater power to the representatives of the people. This applies to the European Parliament just as much as to the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliaments then continued to complain nonetheless; this time, about the increased workload, the mountains of documents constantly landing on their desks with just a few weeks for them to respond. The important thing, however, is that the representatives of the people in Europe’s capitals now have a means of exerting influence over the European Union’s initiatives – and I get the impression that the national parliaments are increasingly realising this and making use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two years have now passed since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, when these procedures also took effect. I and a few of my fellow Members therefore felt that the time was right to ask how the Commission sees the situation now. Is it satisfied with the quality of the response from the national parliaments? How does the Commission deal with this? Does it have sufficient resources – including human resources – to deal with it? Moreover, in some Member States, the regions are important, such as the <span class="italic">Bundesländer</span> in the case of Germany. How is input from this political level dealt with? Does it have sufficient resonance? Is there also adequate cooperation with the Committee of the Regions?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the questions put jointly by Andrew Duff, Alexandra Thein, Michael Theurer and myself. I look forward to hearing your answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The subsidiarity control mechanism is up and running, and its implementation has so far been very smooth, thanks not only to thorough preparation by both the Commission and the national parliaments before the Treaty entered into force, but also to the excellent cooperation and constructive contacts between the Commission and the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience gained so far has clearly shown that national parliaments are well prepared and ready to assume their new role and powers under the new Treaty. By the end of September 2011, the Commission had sent to national parliaments 139 draft legislative proposals falling within the scope of the subsidiarity control mechanism, and had received a total of 61 reasoned opinions stating that the respective legislative drafts did not observe the principle of subsidiarity. However, in no case have the thresholds provided for in Protocol No 2, triggering the so-called yellow or orange cards, been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that relations with national parliaments should not be confined merely to questions of subsidiarity, and it supports a deepening of the political dialogue with national parliaments, of which the subsidiarity control mechanism is only one aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the political dialogue, the Commission currently receives and replies to more than 600 opinions per year from national parliaments, including their opinions on the content of Commission proposals. One of the questions put to the Commission was about how we are staffed. A unit in the Secretariat-General is dedicated to relations with national parliaments and, in addition, every DG has designated coordinators for relations with national parliaments, who contribute to smooth implementation of the subsidiarity control mechanism and political dialogue, as do the offices of the relevant Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the overall assessment, the question of the subsidiarity control mechanism and political dialogue is an item regularly discussed at the COSAC meetings, where the Commission meets with members of the national parliaments who work in the European committees. I agree with the honourable Member who pointed out that it is very important that national MPs be more involved in discussions on European legislation. We can see that debate on these issues is much more frequent and more detailed, and that the quality of the opinions coming from the national parliaments is much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to take the same approach on the Commission side because one of the matters raised at recent COSAC meetings concerned comments from national parliaments suggesting that, on some issues, we should be more precise. The national parliaments would like to see more thorough explanation of the subsidiarity clauses in our legislative proposals, and therefore it is a mutual learning process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next phase, we should ensure that sectoral proposals – for example, on the environment and transport – are discussed by the national parliaments not only in the European committees but in the relevant sectoral committees. I believe this would increase interest among national MPs in European legislation, and they would also gain greater ownership and be much more careful when it comes to transposition, which, as we all know, depends heavily on national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the mechanism is working very well. The political dialogue is important because it gives us at the Commission the chance to receive not only reasoned – i.e. negative – opinions, but also a great deal of encouragement and positive opinions from the national parliaments. I am sure that the dialogue will evolve and that the number and quality of both the national parliaments’ opinions and the Commission responses will gradually improve in the coming months and years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the areas falling within the exclusive competence of the EU, the subsidiarity principle is also held to cover, on the one hand, protection of the decision-making powers and activities of Member States, while, on the other hand, legitimising the involvement of the Union in cases where the aims of a particular activity cannot be satisfactorily achieved by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliament involvement resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and particularly Protocol No 2, forms the subject of the annual report submitted by the Commission. The report addresses the issue of whether the principles of subsidiarity are put into practice by institutions such as the European Commission, Parliament, the Council or the Committee of the Regions. It also addresses the subsidiarity mechanism of national parliaments, which was one of the anticipated innovations implemented through the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. In my opinion, Mr Šefčovič, it is right to focus attention on certain initiatives that have provoked questions in the area of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been defending the idea of the subsidiarity principle for many years now. Since 1 December 2009, Member States have had the opportunity to inform the President of the European Commission in a reasoned opinion that proposed legislation is not, in their opinion, compliant with the subsidiarity principle. I would therefore be interested, Mr Vice-President, to hear the Commission’s opinion as to what it has managed to do in this matter, and how it has handled the requests of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that a control mechanism is being devised for compliance with Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

In practical terms, the characteristics of each Member State need to be taken into account, as well as those of its sub-units, when applying it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must highlight the limited control exerted by the Court of Justice of the European Union over the application of this principle. This court can only go ahead and revoke an act issued illegally, without verifying compliance with subsidiarity.

This issue has really been turned on its head.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, instead of the Member States deciding what the EU can do better, the EU decides what the Member States can do better. Now they tell us that the Member States can object! If that is the case, what are the practical consequences of this? The fact is that the monitoring process offers few guarantees. The conditions imposed, particularly the federalist drive that is becoming ever stronger in this process, prevent decisions taken at EU level from being reversed, even when they disregard the subsidiarity principle. First and foremost, it is therefore important to turn the subsidiarity principle back around so that it is facing the right way; in other words, it should be the people who decide what can be done better on their behalf at EU level, rather than the Union stipulating what it believes can be done better by the Member States and imposing it on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, two years after the Lisbon Treaty came into force, there has not been a single occasion when there has been a sufficiently large number of members – two thirds – in the national parliaments to lodge an objection, thereby enabling the principle of subsidiarity to be blocked. Essentially, this was actually included in the Lisbon Treaty in the clear knowledge that it would not work. You are very well aware that a parliamentary procedure for adopting a decision in just one parliament takes two, sometimes three months, let alone 18 parliaments doing this. Indeed, the figures presented by the Commissioner here speak for themselves: 130 motions – 60 objections. Less than half an objection to one motion, when 18 objections are required. I think that, in the case of subsidiarity, the principle should be applied in reverse. The first step is to obtain approval from the parliaments, after which the next step is to adopt the act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a strength in the sense that Member States can legislate in certain areas themselves, and they cannot be blaming the European Union for everything and say the European Union should do this, that or the other thing. It is a weakness and particularly it is a weakness which we see in the response to the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain things that probably most people would agree need to be done at a much quicker pace, but because of subsidiarity, that cannot happen. Nevertheless, if it comes to Treaty change, it is going to be vital that we spell it out very clearly and work very closely with national parliaments to get the issues which we want resolved. Having said that, it is encouraging to hear what the Commissioner said regarding the responses from national parliaments in relation to the Lisbon Treaty and subsidiarity, and that is certainly my experience in my own country as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also, I have to thank the European Parliament for a very constructive approach towards this mechanism and also towards the cooperation between the Commission and the national parliaments. I am deeply convinced that the good work of the subsidiarity control mechanism and its efficient application is in the interests of all of us. This is not about blocking European integration but about making it more transparent to the citizens and also more democratic, because the issues are, in this manner, being brought closer to the hearts of citizens and to their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I also very much welcome the positive tone and constructive approach of the speakers and the roles of the national parliaments in this debate, because their role is also essential when it comes to the building of an inclusive Europe that resonates in the capitals of our Member States and is closely linked to the concerns of the citizens. The Commission is fostering an active political dialogue with the national parliaments. This has been very fruitful, as has been demonstrated by the numbers of opinions and reasoned opinions. We would, of course, very much encourage this tendency to continue in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question relating to the Committee of the Regions, of course we cooperate with the Committee of the Regions very closely. The Committee can play an active role in the mechanism and, most importantly, ensures that there is a voice for local and regional authorities at European level. More specifically, the Committee of the Regions’ subsidiarity monitoring network provides a very good access point for regional and local authorities, and can enable the Commission, in some situations, to reinforce the analysis of regional aspects in its impact assessments. It can also help the Commission to strengthen the analysis of subsidiarity and proportionality in the future. In conformity with the Protocol on Cooperation between the Commission and the Committee of the Regions, the Commission regularly provides the Committee of the Regions with comments on its opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the subsidiarity control mechanism and regional bodies, we have to respect the Treaty. The Treaty is very clear in this respect, because it states that it is for each national Parliament or each chamber of a national parliament to consult its appropriate regional parliaments with legislative powers. We have to respect the Treaty in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and last questions were on how the mechanism works in practice. I have to say that the national parliaments have been quite efficient and effective in their responses to the legislative proposals from the Commission. It does not look as if they have a particular problem with respecting the eight-week deadline, and we are absolutely punctual when it comes to the legislative deadlines. At the same time as the legislative proposal is sent to the European Parliament and to the Council, it is also sent to the national parliaments. We have seen that within eight weeks, the national parliaments are ready and able to send us their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do now in the Commission is to be more efficient in terms of responses. The Commission has installed a new IT system which is making it easier to record all the responses, and it is trying to improve the quality of its responses to the national parliaments and to work in more detail on the opinions we receive from the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, two years after the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the subsidiarity monitoring mechanism is working very well. I am sure that it will be a very important tool for involving the national parliaments more closely in the process of European cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, they are supposed to verify Brussels’ right to act. However, if I have correctly understood the figures quoted by Commissioner Šefčovič – specifically, 61 opinions on 139 legislative proposals in September – the mechanism is not working properly and the thresholds laid down in the Treaties to oppose a text cannot be used. The Commissioner seemed to be saying that all this was improving and that ongoing dialogue was taking place with the national parliaments to seek their opinion. Personally, I question the ability of parliaments that are completely sold on the idea of a European superstate to oppose anything, regardless of what the peoples whom they ‘represent’ want! We have seen this in France, when the parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority the text of the Lisbon Treaty, which was rejected by the French people. We are still seeing it with the stability funds and mechanisms, which give the European Union outrageous powers to run the peoples into debt in order to save the euro, when the only solution is to give Greece back its monetary sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, two years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, it seems appropriate to ask the Commission about its assessment of the application of the subsidiarity principle, in particular, according to the data it has on the participation of national and regional parliaments. It is vital that the Commission has the resources to work alongside national and regional parliaments and with the Committee of the Regions, with a view to the effective monitoring of the application of the subsidiarity principle. Some legislative proposals for monitoring the subsidiarity principle have already been tabled by the Commission, which reveal its support for dialogue with the national parliaments. However, it is also important that the regional parliaments be able to participate effectively in the European decision-making process on issues that concern them.
