<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the report on the European Year of Lifelong Learning is seemingly an unimportant document, and yet it has revealed significant gaps and black spots in the European system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concerns a year of information and promotion in response to the Luxembourg Summit and other summits, at which tremendous importance was given to training as a means of integrating Europeans into working life, irrespective of age. The report has shown, first of all, that when money is invested in education, that money is multiplied. The Member States keen to participate quadrupled their budgets. That is, money invested in education gives the best results as it is multiplied and does not lead to fraud, or anything like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Year of Lifelong Learning highlighted the Commission's difficulty in providing information and responses and being transparent. It was practically impossible to gather all the necessary documentation, partly, it seems, because the Member States do not provide it, and partly because there are no procedures for collecting it with the necessary ease and speed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore turned the report into a response and a series of recommendations on the criteria that we think lifelong learning should meet. We found ourselves with a muddle of criteria, partly introduced by the Council, as the document published by the Commission, the proposal for the Year of Lifelong Learning, was of far higher quality. It is clear that we need much more clarity over training. However, training for integration, language teaching and recreational training for the elderly is mixed up with training for work, resulting in such a muddle that it is impossible to make an assessment or gauge the quality and know what the criteria are for good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we are asking for the educational objectives to be clearly distinguished and regulated. Obviously, education for the integration of immigrants is not the same as training for new qualifications, training for a first job or retraining, or many other types. We have therefore requested clarity and better organisation of the system as a whole. We have also requested greater lifelong learning and retraining for teachers. It is clear that, if we consider lifelong learning to be simply for unqualified groups, account will not be taken of retraining university staff and teachers at training centres, who have to be the flagship of knowledge and disseminate information in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have asked that it be made quite clear where the money from the Structural Funds for training, which is not monitored, is going. From our point of view, this is a key issue. What we cannot have is Europe paying so little attention to education and the education funds being used for other purposes. One of the great problems of European history stems from the fact that once social classes have fought their way up the social scale and succeeded in integrating into the ruling classes, they have imitated the faults of the aristocracy, they have become conceited and lost sight of the value of training and the fight to retain the knowledge they have acquired.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we are living in an aristocratic Europe, which does not want to concern itself with education, which has become somewhat conceited about being European. We consider that it is enough to be a European citizen and we do not realise that if we want to have researchers, if we want to have a truly competitive Europe, we need to take care of our human resources. Europe needs to realise that, in spite of the subsidiarity principle, training people and helping them to manage themselves and their future is one of the fundamental objectives of its existence.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, a Europe that only takes care of its own interests, a Europe of subsidies, a Europe with teachers who only want to reduce their teaching hours, a Europe that contemplates and confuses trade union policy with educational policy is a worrying Europe. I would like to draw attention to this situation, and I believe that we must rethink our attitude towards education, as we are talking about people and our future.</p>

I also think, however, that we ought again to use this morning’s discussion to raise awareness once more and to make people aware of education again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all delighted with the new achievements of our age: travel, the Internet, mobile phones and simultaneous television broadcasts from the other side of the world, as we are now experiencing again with the Olympic Games in Australia. These are all achievements, but also signs of the time and of the society in which we live: the information age, the information society, the age of knowledge, technology and globalisation, to mention but a few designations. All are characterised by a very rapid pace of change and by an enormous number of transformations, indeed revolutions, which have been triggered, and continue to be triggered, by the new knowledge. The dissemination of information and knowledge is now incomparably faster and more extensive than it was even a few years ago. People must be prepared for this vertiginous and fascinating roller coaster of change.</p>
<p class="contents">From the earliest days of childhood, from schooldays in fact, the key words have been lifelong learning. That tenet is now only half the truth, however, and it cannot remain so, for the processes of change and transformation in society, in the world of work and in the environment are by no means over after school or after training, but continue and become still more marked. Human beings must therefore learn to meet these challenges themselves and to adjust to lifelong learning. Only in that way can we all, in future, also participate in the fine achievements of our age, that is to say, hold our own in the ever more rapidly changing competitiveness of life – both personal and professional – and both seize and help to create opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to help these insights come to the fore throughout Europe, 1996 was designated the European Year of Lifelong Learning. With relatively modest financial resources of ECU 8.4 million from the European Union, a much welcomed ECU 34 million was raised for the project with the help of partner countries from the European Economic Area: Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway. In many congresses, seminars and PR events, there was constructive discussion in all areas of society of the necessity and opportunities for rethinking education in the direction of lifelong learning. These are opportunities – especially for Europe and European integration – of which we can avail ourselves here and now: knowledge of other languages, other cultures, other ways of life, everything that is so important for us as Europe grows together.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Year of Lifelong Learning set us thinking in a way which must be continued and consolidated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that a small elite would continue to create, pass on or acquire new knowledge and ideas, but for the great majority, leaving school meant the end of formal education.</p>
<p class="contents">Things have changed radically. Learning has become broader and longer. New methods and sources for acquiring knowledge and training have appeared. Anyone who does not keep up with this progress, these new requirements, risks becoming marginalised, undervalued in his or her professional life, risks losing social status and suffering intellectual impoverishment. It is said, and rightly so, that we are becoming a society of information and knowledge. The great philosopher Nietzsche, however, warned us that it is impossible to found a civilisation on knowledge. This warning should give us food for thought. Although, today, there is no alternative to scientific progress and to the increase in knowledge and information, the truth of the matter is that lifelong learning cannot be reduced simply to the acquisition of useful skills. It must be part of a culture, of a set of values that provide meaning for mankind’s life in society. Lifelong learning and training has therefore become an indispensable factor that states, educational bodies and the public themselves can no longer underestimate.</p>
<p class="contents">Holding the European Year of Lifelong Learning and Training was an important step and a symbolic moment in raising the awareness of the European people with regard to this new state of affairs. The theorising that preceded and continued throughout the European Year of Lifelong Learning and the considerable interest it raised in schools and citizens’ groups made a major contribution to this. ‘Lifelong learning and training’ has definitively entered the vocabulary of politicians, educationalists and businesspeople. Even more importantly, these words have also become part of everyday language. Lifelong learning and training has also become an instrument in the fight against academic failure, students giving up on education and illiteracy. It is therefore a good cause. For these reasons, this initiative was valuable, timely and fruitful. Its objectives were achieved and what was lacking in funds was compensated for by the harnessing of goodwill and by the number of people who signed up to it. The line between people’s first educational experiences and later opportunities has now been crossed. Education…</p>

<p class="contents">This coincides with the ideas expressed a few months ago at the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, when all the Member States pledged to develop a series of measures at European Union level so that, during this decade, the European Union can become a leading society at international level and achieve the levels of competence that North America has today, particularly in technological areas.</p>
<p class="contents">To be precise, the key element in the process to achieve this level of competence lies in training, education and in a society with levels of excellence that lay the necessary foundations for progress to be made in the most technologically developed and advanced fields of scientific and technological innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, and she has also mentioned this today, shows the imbalances that still exist in the field of education between the level of the European Union and national level, that is, on the one hand we want action in education at European Union level, but on the other, the Member States do not want to give up their competences and establish true cooperation on an educational level. It is true that there are some programmes that we always use as references, such as Socrates or Leonardo, but in precisely these programmes, we must recognise the lack of sufficient resources to achieve the scope and effect that we would like.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I therefore recommend that you pay particular attention to points 16, 17, 18, 19, 23 and 24, which constitute a good guide for the achievement of these higher levels of education at European Union level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Philosophical and literary texts, as well as popular wisdom, tell us that ‘you are never too old to learn’. The ‘Lifelong Learning’ initiative was a perfectly proper one and the result of a wise decision, aimed at doing justice to the demands of the twenty-first century and at enabling people to adjust to these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">It is mainly the early phases of life which, right into our own time, have been, and remain, the time for education and training. The importance of lifelong learning cannot, however, be limited to the spheres of education and training policy alone. Its success also depends, in large measure, upon labour-market policy and upon the successful dissemination of science and technology. Lifelong learning begins where schooling, or basic education, leaves off, and this is where the first and, in my view, also the greatest weakness of this wonderful initiative is to be found. Lifelong learning can only work if there is a change to the way in which, and above all the pace at which, basic education under the original educational systems is adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">In a knowledge society, one of the main functions of schooling should be to offer students methods they need to gain access to large amounts of information, to understand this information and to transform it into knowledge. Syllabuses, or the means by which learning has so far been imparted, must be fundamentally altered. I do not of course want to interfere in the nation states, but this is, nonetheless, an idea which we ought to explore communally in this European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the direction taken should be an individual one, but with social components. We need to learn more about arguing critically, about increasing students’ self-confidence and about increasing their ability to express themselves in language. Skills of this kind will become ever more important alongside instrumental skills such as the ability to write, to acquire other languages and to do arithmetic.</p>
<p class="contents">One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed. Our society must break away from the outdated system of school, work and pension. Lifelong learning begins, then, with the reform of our schooling. The individual must learn for him or herself. That is not something it lies within our power to bring about, but we can do a lot to help bring it about, for the population of Europe is not, of course, just a human resource for the European labour market, but a wealth of marvellous individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give a personal example by way of conclusion. I know a joiner in a small suburb of Vienna where the prejudice is still somewhat commonly held that anyone who works with their hands must not be very well educated. This joiner is between 40 and 50 years of age, speaks four languages and is known as something of a philosopher. A Europe of people like that would be my ideal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In spite of the time wasted, the rapporteur regrets that the qualitative assessment of the implementation of the theme year programme is imperfect. The number of opportunities can surely be counted in a shorter space of time than this. In a seminar on the European paper industry held here in Strasbourg on Wednesday a representative of employees in the industry turned our intention to an important issue. When we purchase hardware, it is always an investment, but when we acquire software labelled ‘company staff training’, it is not considered to be an investment. The rapporteur has justifiably emphasised this.</p>
<p class="contents">Training has to be considered to be an investment and not a running cost. We must stress the importance of the fact that lifelong learning also involves an all-round educational element and not just a professional one. Far too often training is too biased in its scope, and that is especially true today of information society development. Electronic programs are complicated and get more so all the time. Those who master the language of software often do not understand the language of its content. Can I ask something that is being asked in Finland now? A man speaks six languages, but what has he got to say? A person might speak the language of computers in the information society, but perhaps he has nothing else to say. It is only noughts and ones anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">In this, we are clashing with the eEurope strategy, which the Commission prepared for the Lisbon summit. Much attention was paid to hardware in it, but little to that software which we call training software. The public must be trained, not only to use computers, but also to use them for their own benefit. People must know how to use computers for beneficial and essential purposes so they can improve their own way of working and take better control of their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, everyone must have the necessary reading and writing skills to use the various forms of electronic media to their advantage. This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning. When, under the eEurope programme, the aim is in place to bring a computer cable into every home, that will increase democracy. These days, democracy is created by everyone having equal access to a diverse array of information. For the information to be fully exploited we have to remember that learning is also a social event. Training cannot be left to depend on the eEurope programme alone: we also need social communities for it.</p>
<p class="contents">As no one knows everything, an individual must be able to decide for him/herself what is worth knowing. If the state makes that decision it is just a step away from propaganda and indoctrination. When we examine EU programmes, which are often mean the same kind of thing for everyone or contain demands for conformity on the part of everyone, we see we are turning the EU into a totalitarian federation. We need lifelong learning and all-round educational knowledge, so that we can counter the attempt by the European Union to create a European totalitarian state and be its politburo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just an hour ago I was still sitting with my French teacher, making a big effort to learn some more French. I must tell you, it is really fun learning a language. It is good when you know that you do not have to take an examination afterwards but are learning for yourself and in order to communicate with other people and treat them in the right way. I have to say that I am honestly enjoying learning French</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President asked the speaker whether he might not like to continue his speech in French.)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that is also what we need in the future: for learning to be fun. In life, the learning pyramid is, in fact, turning. When it comes to learning, we really used to think of young full-time students, whereas now we see that people in employment are having to learn more and more. I believe that we, ourselves, in the European Parliament can confirm that we are actually, day by day, doing more in the way of learning, evaluating and passing judgment than ever we had to do at school or university. With increasing age, you also become more aware of what it is you would like to learn. You become significantly more selective, and it is the very joy of learning that makes you enthusiastic and want to learn new things.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here, then, is a paradigm shift, not only in the economy, but also in broad strata of society, not only through e-learning and the new opportunities provided by technology, but also through a change in consciousness. I believe that this very change in consciousness shows that adults in all walks of life really do consider lifelong learning of this kind to be more and more important. I therefore consider it a very good thing that we in the European Parliament should have a good look at long-term strategic issues of this kind. Especially on a Friday like today, it is important, I believe, that we should also have the courage to think in terms of long-term strategy about how we might best provide support to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly for elderly people, the subject of health becomes increasingly important on into old age. We still have a lot to learn about, for example, how to eat properly and how to treat our bodies. I believe that precisely these fundamental virtues are very important for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need now at the level of the European Community? We need a general system of accreditation for private, public and in-house education, a European education passport like a European driving licence so that the building blocks of education can be used and compared throughout Europe. We need ways of comparing educational expenditure and revenue throughout Europe, as well as ways of comparing qualifications. We should be trying to introduce best practices worldwide as a spur to positive competition. We ought to be learning from the whole world which system and which form of education are best for our people and citizens in Europe.</p>

When I picked up the agenda and read the phrase ‘Year of Lifelong Learning’ it seemed to me that this was an oxymoron similar to the phrase ‘military intelligence’. A year seems a short time for the project.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: how valuable are these ‘Year of ...’ enterprises when applications for funding have to be submitted within three months and everything will have to be carried out in one year. I have been at the receiving end of such systems, both as a university teacher and when I was involved in an educational and social charity.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of people trying to do the job, these challenges, at very short notice and with very little explanation of how applications are to be made and what criteria are to be applied, can do at least as much harm as good.</p>
<p class="contents">One can always point to the fact afterwards that the money was spent and other money came in and that good things have been achieved; but could things have been done better? Both the Committee reports – the Committee report and the subsidiary Committee opinion – draw attention to the fact that the assessment methodology used by the Commission was not very exact and the criteria set were not particularly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not to say we should not do these things, but we should do them better and reflect very carefully on what can best be done at Community level and what at lower levels, not even at Member State level or in autonomous regions within the Member States, but right down at the level of schools, colleges and universities.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituency has just come through a serious crisis in its educational assessment, partly due to a lack of proper consultation with classroom teachers. Grandiose ideas issued from on high and not adequately and rigorously tested at the sharp end will always fail, sometimes with damaging consequences for individuals and for society. Subsidiarity matters, especially in a field like education and lifelong learning, and we forget that at our peril.</p>
<p class="contents">Networking can be useful in disseminating ideas for best practice, but we must not delude ourselves that a Year of Lifelong Learning will make a real difference. That can only come from the commitment of the people on the ground. Those are the people we must respect and encourage and support.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in favour of lifelong learning, but let us not be too self-congratulatory when the evidence is so thin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can hear that especially from this discussion. When it comes to taking action, however, the situation is often the reverse. I agree with the rapporteur who criticises the Commission’s efforts on behalf of lifelong learning during 1996, the year of the relevant campaign, together with the slipshod evaluation which followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lifelong learning is a phenomenon requiring a lot of resources. It demands new thinking on educational policy and calls for financial resources to be prioritised. Allow me to begin by commenting on the new thinking required. In our education systems, we specialise in the contrary, that is to say self-enclosed educational courses, limited by time and with heavy emphasis upon the final examination. Lifelong learning requires the opposite, namely continuity and courses of long duration. It is no longer enough to educate for the immediate needs of the workplace. Now, it is a matter of educating people for life. We therefore need new forms of organisation in education. We need new educational ideas and tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the greatest problem is that which many other speakers have raised, namely access to money. We need to allocate much greater resources to education than we have done up until now, both to the workplace and to the public education system, as well as to other areas. There must be money to pay for the costs of education and also to replace income in the form of wages, especially in the case of those who need to study full-time. It is especially important to be able to finance the fairly long study periods which may be required if people are to be able to move from traditional sectors to new areas of the labour market. Because access to money is always a problem, I think that quantitative objectives are required in connection with expenditure on adult education. Consideration might be given to earmarking a certain proportion of companies’ production costs for this purpose, a specific percentage of the State budget, a particular portion of normal working hours or, if appropriate, a certain number of the individual’s working hours. Alternatively, other similar quantitative measures might be made use of.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency, which will begin on 1 January 2001, has said that lifelong learning will be one of its priorities. I think we could call upon the Swedish Government to propose just such quantitative objectives for lifelong adult education. Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities. Perhaps we could issue a joint statement to the Swedish Presidency on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that a majority of this House will also learn and not go ahead and abolish these Friday sittings.</p>
<p class="contents">But now to the subject in hand. Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has submitted an excellent report which is also very critical of the fact that our heads of state and government are constantly making grandiose announcements. The Feira Summit was just such an occasion – a pure media event, to use the buzz word. Very little of substance happened, however. Little is being provided for in terms of the budget and few resources are available, because it is all about appearances. We need to put an end to this kind of spin.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very grateful for the sound report which Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines has submitted. One thing, of course, she has quite clearly emphasised is the importance of the subsidiarity principle. Nonetheless, resources must also be invested at European level. Above all, value must be attached to quality in this area, and quality means setting priorities. One of our priorities must be to extend precisely this idea of lifelong learning to people in the candidate States for, in Central and Eastern Europe, a totalitarian system has, for decades, robbed people of the opportunity to develop freely. It is a great failing of our strategy that we concentrate very heavily upon young people in these countries. It is obviously important to do that as well, but the bulk of people are elderly – elderly people who have to overcome decades of dictatorship but who are, today, able to make a fresh start. This too is something we need to support by making this area a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that, in my view, elderly people in particular, who nowadays still have twenty or thirty productive years in front of them after they retire, must be able to play an increased part in our society. As a part of this process, there must also be educational opportunities. I am sorry that, nowadays, the discussion is about increasingly closing the doors of universities to older people, charging fees and ensuring that older people can no longer take an active part in the life of universities.</p>

National coordinating bodies suffered from such matters as materials arriving late and there not being enough of them. Furthermore, things moved slowly when it came to using the Internet. That naturally made it hard to implement the theme year programme. Unfortunately, the situation appears to be the same with the Socrates programme 2 that has just started. Messages of concern are coming from national agencies that the agreements between them and the Commission are still not finalised and there is a lack of certainty about payment. This cannot help but be reflected also in the implementation of the adult education component, Grundvik, which forms part of Socrates. That is a pity. The administrative problems associated with Socrates have to be resolved swiftly for the Union’s input into lifelong learning to come within reach of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Training and education are being seen more and more clearly as European resources. They do not mean just vital items of expenditure. Hopefully the change in attitudes will also be reflected before long in the Union’s budget. But the Year of European Languages, organised for next year, will have to persevere in the same way, appropriations being as meagre as they were with the Year of Lifelong Learning. Parliament, however, did its best to establish a legal basis in time for the measures to be effected.</p>
<p class="contents">Although training comes under the principle of subsidiarity, its European dimension is strengthening all the time. European success in global competition is built on skilled and involved people. Lifelong learning is essential in the fight against unemployment and exclusion. It is justifiable that the report adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport should contain a request to the Commission to apply the notion of further education, not only at the level of advanced know-how and skills and universities, but also in traditional professions, particularly the craftsmen trades. Lifelong learning, as such, is often seen only as a necessary regeneration of the workforce. It should, however, be a fundamental right of every citizen, leading not just to improved professional skills, but also to human growth, happiness and understanding. The facilities modern technology offers for learning can be brought within everybody’s reach. That opportunity must be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be far better if we could avoid that sort of failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The saddest case of all is a school leaver with no qualifications to his credit descending into hopelessness. A situation which becomes sadder and sadder as the occupations available to those with no qualifications become scarcer and scarcer. The reason is often that the young teenager is discouraged from learning by the rigidities of an education system that sticks to established lines and tries to fit square pegs into round holes.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Commission to look favourably on a research programme into the use and development of aptitude tests to identify at an early stage – 12 or 13 years old at the latest – what a young person is going to be good at, no matter what that profession, occupation or job may be. Schools have to respond by providing courses at which young people will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Success encourages further ambition. It means satisfied, enthusiastic teenagers instead of discouraged troublemakers. It means school-leavers with light in their eyes, with excitement about the future, able to contribute to society. It means school-leavers with a passport to a better and more fulfilling life. Nothing is more vital to the future of Europe than the young people who are going to build that Europe. There is not one young person who cannot play his part. We have to enable this sadly wasted potential to be mobilised and to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like, on behalf of the Commission, to express our thanks to Mrs Evans who was given the task of drawing up the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and other Members of Parliament who contributed to the quality of this debate both in committee and in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to devote a few moments, ladies and gentlemen, to responding to a number of criticisms outlined in Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines’ report, and stressed by several of you, particularly Mr Herman Schmidt. Naturally I should like to do so by highlighting the positive aspects of this European Year of Lifelong Learning. It is an initiative which, as the report indicates, was very favourably received by Parliament and by the Council. Even though the charge can be levelled that we should have done better yet, it is an initiative which has had a mobilising effect, to judge by the number of people that have been interested and involved in this initiative, and has also had the effect of harnessing additional financial resources which were used in a more decentralised fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a European initiative which we can consider to have been successful on the whole, since it was implemented in this decentralised fashion, closer to the citizens, having involved the national, regional and local authorities in each Member State. Mr Posselt mentioned the spirit and the meaning of subsidiarity, and I noted his concern. I also noted, in the Commission report, in your report, that the initiative engaged the interests of many schools, universities, businesses and associations, not only in the world of education, but also organisations involved in the economy, in combating social exclusion or concerned with rural life.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think, however, ladies and gentlemen, that it is an initiative which has enabled the idea of lifelong education and training, the ambition and the need for it, to emerge from the specialist field of education and training and to gain wider currency among a wider public. I think it was Mrs Klass who stressed this point earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must continue to bear these positive aspects in mind. Now, as promised, I should like to devote some time to answering the set of criticisms expressed in the report. Firstly, I should like to outline the approach adopted by the Commission in determining the level of detail that the report would go into, bearing in mind that a budget of EUR 8 million was allocated for the operation. This is not inconsiderable, but it is not a vast sum either. The Commission wanted to issue a succinct report giving an idea of the content of the European Year of Lifelong Learning and summing up its achievements and impact in a clear manner. We included statistical data, including, of course, figures for the deployment of the budget, which I have just mentioned, but I must state that it is primarily a political impact report.</p>
<p class="contents">To a great extent, the Commission services based this report on an external assessment conducted by a company which, by virtue of its network covering all the participant countries, seemed to me to be able to make an objective analysis of the way this year was perceived by operators in our various countries. The qualitative assessment was based on wide sampling of the projects with additional interviews with national bodies and, subsequently, with the initiators or promoters of these projects at grass roots. The Commission services made the full text of this external assessment available to your rapporteur. Let me add that it is also, of course, possible to consult the archives regarding administration of project budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, and some of you discussed this just now, particularly Mrs Livari, points out a number of delays in the implementation of the European Year of Lifelong Learning, particularly with regard to the distribution of brochures. You must remember that the European Parliament and Council decision regarding this European Year of Lifelong Learning was one of the very first texts adopted under the codecision procedure, and that, in practice, it took some time to adjust to this new procedure. The decision was not formally adopted until the end of October 1995, i.e. only a few weeks before the start of the year itself. This had a perceptible effect on the Commission’s ability to take action. This initial delay, particularly regarding the signature of a contract with advertising service and product suppliers, continued to have effects throughout the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the first call for projects had to be initiated in an extremely informal manner, with the cooperation of national bodies. It was signed in order to implement a project which did not yet exist officially, and once again this provides an objective explanation for some of the gaps highlighted in your report and, unfortunately, the effects of these gaps. I think it was Mr McCormick who mentioned the problems that promoters at grass roots level had in implementing projects. These were clearly the results down the line of the initial delay, which I have just explained.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, like your rapporteur, I regret that some of the publicity materials were available only in three languages, but this was a difficult decision which had to be taken for purely technical reasons in view of the budget and the staffing resources available, as all the language versions of publications issued on behalf of the Commission had to be scrupulously checked.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress, however, that other materials, particularly posters, were available in all the official languages of the European Union and that we gave national bodies the opportunity to add other languages according to their own particular needs. We shall obviously be making a special effort for the European Year of Languages, which we are preparing at the moment, to respect the principle of linguistic pluralism as much as possible. I feel this is necessary and legitimate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines’s report pinpoints a certain lack of clarity with regard to the objectives of the European Year of Lifelong Learning, which she considers to be due to the lack of a definition of lifelong education and training. Just now I heard your fellow Member, Mrs Echerer, mentioning the many philosophical works which have, for centuries, pointed out the simple idea that one never stops learning. Quite apart from this research and these philosophical references, it is true that there were no clear definitions of what this requirement for lifelong education and training should be, while respecting disparities or the identities of our countries and even our regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciated the rapporteur’s attempts to clarify matters by putting forward a definition of various concepts of lifelong education and training. I should, nonetheless, like to defend the Commission’s failure to establish a definition from the outset, particularly if the objective was to limit lifelong education and training to training designed solely to meet the requirements of the labour market, for, even though it is true that the initiative originated in the Commission’s White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, it was nonetheless clearly apparent, right from the first exchanges of views with the European Parliament and the Council, that there was a consensus in favour of a broader approach including all aspects of education and training, practices and achievements. In this field, as I said earlier, systems vary appreciably from one country to another. We had to agree upon a collective idea which would be such as to initiate debate on the significance of lifelong education and training in terms which suited or respected the disparities between national and regional situations. The Commission therefore preferred to emphasise the continuum of training and the complementary nature of the various different aspects of training, including not only initial and higher education and initial and further training, but also other types of more informal training.</p>
<p class="contents">As the year progressed, the Commission became increasingly convinced that this approach was justified. We deliberately supported what might be called recreational training, as we were aware that some people who left the formal education system with the feeling of having failed – Mr Purvis stressed this point earlier and, incidentally, Mr Purvis, I have taken note of your suggestion for a research programme and I shall pass this on to my fellow Commissioners, Mr Busquin and Mrs Reding – people, young people, and not only young people, who leave the educational system with the feeling of having failed must be gradually won back to the idea that learning can be useful, pleasant and can instil self-confidence. It is clear, furthermore, that while lifelong training must become a reality, nonetheless even at the stage of basic education, in what Mr Seppänen called general education, it must be taken into account in order to ensure that every school pupil is motivated and has the necessary skills to learn in the various situations he will find himself in as an adult. In a nutshell, the child must learn how to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the end of the European Year of Lifelong Learning, in the direction which Mr Lage mentioned just now, the idea of lifelong education and training continues to gain ground. It is no mere chance, ladies and gentlemen, that since 1996, for instance, ministers in a number of European countries have been made specifically responsible for lifelong learning. This concept provided the basis for the discussions which led to the latest generation of Socrates, Leonardo de Vinci and Youth Programmes. It was taken up by the G8 ministers who last year in Cologne adopted a charter on the subject, inspired to a great extent by the debates which took place within the fifteen Member States in the course of this European Year of Lifelong Learning. Moreover, as you know, education from this angle has continued to be one of the themes of the Japanese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has continued its deliberations on lifelong training and, as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm requested earlier, our endeavours from now on will be in keeping with the follow up to the European Council in Lisbon. In a few weeks, my fellow Commissioner, Mrs Reding, is to issue a draft memorandum on lifelong education and training to the Commission. This document will be sent to you before the end of October.</p>
<p class="contents">You will appreciate that today, at this stage, it is difficult for me to go any further into the details of this memo, but the link with employment, which your rapporteur, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, called for, will of course be a key element of the memo, although the aspect of the rounded development of each individual, which remains one of the prime functions of education, will not be neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue the debate on lifelong education and training with you, with this House, in that context. When I speak of the Commission, I am, of course, not only referring to the Commissioner directly responsible for matters of education, Viviane Reding. I mean, rather, that we feel concerned, many of us very directly, by this challenge, particularly, let me tell you, as Commissioner for Regional Policy, when I am signing agreements and working with the Member States and the regions on the content and the quality of programming documents in each of the Member States. I am entirely prepared to make room for the question of lifelong education and training and, in general, educational matters, in Structural Fund programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, I think it was Mr Seppänen who brought up a subject which I consider to be an absolute priority, i.e. access to the information society, not just for young people or students, but also for the older elements of the general public, and sections of the population that are often forgotten, such as farmers or small- and medium-sized businesses. Let me repeat what I have already told this House: I shall not sign any programming document for any European region in relation to regional policy, for which I am responsible, unless it includes a very clear plan for access to the information society for this region and for each region, and I do not mean access programmes exclusively for people of primary, secondary or higher education age.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, on a lighter note, that the response I have just given you on behalf of the European Commission in my mother tongue will provide an additional resource for Mr Rübig in his enthusiastic learning of the French language throughout his life as a European Member of Parliament.</p>

This fundamental fact has fuelled debates at the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira. We further acknowledged that this right must be adapted to cater for the advent of the information society.</p>
<p class="contents">New information and communications technology do indeed have serious repercussions on teaching methodology. It is now acknowledged that education and training should be a lifelong process and so, throughout these summit meetings, the Commission and the Member States have been encouraged to define coherent strategies and practical measures in order to make lifelong education and training accessible to all. Some parties had, however, begun to consider this subject well before that, since, even in 1996, the Commission proposed to the Council and to Parliament that the year 1996 be declared the ‘European Year of Lifelong Learning’. The purpose of this year was to make European citizens aware of new concepts in academic and vocational education and to conduct joint discussions with all the operators involved in the role and the stakes of education and training at the dawn of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the high stakes involved, I can only, like our rapporteur, deplore the fact that the budget for the European Year of Lifelong Learning was limited to EUR 8.4 million for the fifteen Member States and their three partners in the EEA.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, we must deplore the flagrant lack of qualitative data in the Commission report. The Commission should therefore improve the quality of its reports in future. In future programmes, their work should concentrate on defining with greater precision the various concepts and aspects of vocational and lifelong training. They should also speedily implement action programmes and specific measures in the context of a lifelong education and training strategy. The implementation of such measures must be coordinated with the Socrates II and Leonardo programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to ensure that all citizens can benefit from this training in new technologies, as there is a great danger of seeing a ‘digital divide’ being established between the men and women who have the means to access this technology and those who do not. The entire debate on the place of universal public service in new telecommunications networks is also involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These developments entail increased harmonisation of programming on arms supplies, insofar as Member States consider this appropriate.</p>
<p>The arms sector certainly remains within the jurisdiction of the Member States, as illustrated by the specific case the honourable Member refers to, and the States may cite Article 296 of the Treaty on European Union. However, the significant progress achieved in terms of crisis management policy and in defining the objectives for collective capacities are such as to favour ever more in-depth exchanges regarding the identification of armaments needs and programming supplies.

<p>Preparations for the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (COP 6), which will be held in The Hague in November 2000 are progressing at a steady pace within the Council with a view to establishing the European Union's negotiating position on the many still unresolved aspects of implementation of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 1992 Framework Convention.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the Hague Conference and to the preparatory meeting of the Convention's subsidiary bodies (SBI/SBSTA 13), which will be held in Lyon on 4-15 September 2000, the subject of climate change will be placed on the agenda for the Environment Council meeting of 10 October 2000. Moreover, an extraordinary meeting of the Council is scheduled for 7 November 2000, at which ministers will discuss in more detail the EU strategy for the final negotiations at COP 6.</p>
<p>The European Union's determination to make COP 6 a success has been expressed, and its priorities for the Hague Conference have been set out on several occasions, most recently in the conclusions of the Environment Council of 22 June 2000. Its priorities concern in particular the adoption of a strong and comprehensive system for ensuring compliance with the obligations set out in the Kyoto Protocol, clear and effective rules for the three Kyoto mechanisms (emissions trading, joint implementation and the clean development mechanism), the treatment of sinks, progress on policies and measures which should constitute the principal instrument for achieving the quantitative emission limitation and reduction targets accepted at Kyoto, and the elaboration and implementation of modalities and procedures for cooperation with developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the context of the 1992 Convention.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 22 June 2000, the Council also called on the Commission to indicate how Community budgets, programmes and funds should be oriented in order to provide for measures to help the applicant countries comply with the Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p>The Hague Conference is a key objective for the French Presidency as far as environmental policy is concerned. The Lyon Conference, organised under the auspices of the United Nations, will be opened on 11 September by the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin. It constitutes a crucial stage in the process leading up to the Hague Conference in November, which will have to determine the mechanisms needed to ensure the viability of the Kyoto Protocol.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0654"></a>

This also comprises combating the abuse of the Internet and paedophile networks.</p>
<p>To serve this purpose several initiatives have been put on the presidency’s agenda to bring the issue forward in the light of numerous decisions taken by the Council in the past years – the latest was the adoption by the Council on 29 May 2000 of a Decision to combat child pornography on the Internet<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. As regards the French Presidency’s initiatives, in November 2000 a seminar will be held on police investigations and new information technologies aimed at discussing certain operational and legal problems. Furthermore the Presidency intends to launch several initiatives based on the Elements of the Union’s strategy against high-tech crime<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span> and the recommendations made in the seminar.</p>
<p>The Presidency’s policy on fighting cybercrime has already been confirmed by the Informal Council Justice and Home affairs in Marseilles from 28 and 29 July 2000, where the ministers agreed, upon invitation from the Presidency, to act together in the area of the fight against crimes related to new technologies. Member States will thus inform each other of their capacity for action; furthermore they will seek to perfect a draft convention on Cyber Crime currently negotiated within the Council of Europe and, if this draft contains deficiencies, they will prepare a protocol to the Mutual Legal Assistance Convention. They concluded that actions of the European Union should be directed towards measures ensuring the rapidity of intervention, harmonisation of the rules for information-keeping, dissuasive penalties against the authors of offences, including those who attack networks and the implementation of operational units.</p>
<p>The French Presidency welcomes the Irish Minister of Justice’s initiative as an important contribution to the common goal to safeguard the legal use of the Internet.

<p>The Council supports efforts intended to ensure that all shipping vessels, in compliance with international law, observe the regulations adopted by the Regional Fisheries Organisations. In this context, the Council is aware of the important part that regulating the international trade in fish species can play in combating illegal or unregulated fishing.</p>
<p>I shall outline a number of measures which the Community has undertaken to this effect internationally.</p>
<p>The Community has ratified the ‘Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas’, adopted by the FAO Conference on 24 November 1993. This Agreement has not yet, however, come into force.</p>
<p>The Community is an active member of ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) and the GFCM (General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean), and both of these regional fisheries organisations have jurisdiction regarding fish stocks in the Mediterranean. Both these organisations have adopted resolutions targeting the vessels of non-contracting parties. ICCAT has even adopted some measures to prevent the import of bluefin tuna and bluefin tuna products from specific countries which have not complied with ICCAT conservation and management regulations for that species. These measures are applied by the Community.</p>
<p>The Community is taking an active part in preparing for the Technical Consultation on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing which will be held in Rome on 2-6 October 2000 and which will deal with possible actions including supporting measures for the international fish trade in order to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities.</p>
<p>In addition to all its efforts within international fora, the Council has taken steps to prevent the unloading in Community ports of fish caught by third country vessels in violation of the conservation and management regulations adopted by the Regional Fisheries Organisations to which the Community belongs, i.e. ICCAT and the GFCM.</p>

<p>On 31 January 2000, the European Community’s Statistical Office published a report on the various aspects of social exclusion in the EU Member States. The report points out that one-parent families and the unemployed in the EU have not benefited from its prosperity and that these two categories figure prominently among the low-income segment of the population and are ‘socially excluded’ from every point of view. Bearing in mind that social exclusion is a multidimensional phenomenon that is difficult to overcome and that, in its answer to my Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0009_EN.html">H-0009/00</a><a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the previous Presidency-in-Office of the Council stated that the problem of social exclusion could be tackled by measures capable of promoting economic development and competitiveness – measures which, although necessary, are liable to create ‘exclusion’ – what are the views of the French Presidency on possible methods of combating social exclusion such as separating employment and social welfare entitlement, introducing a tax policy, notably to combat financial speculation, and establishing a policy for income redistribution?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member, who has quoted the Council's response to one of his previous questions, recalls, the Council is very attentive to poverty-related issues in the European Union and would affirm that, since the principal cause of poverty is exclusion from the labour market, its efforts have been principally concerned with employment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as the honourable Member is aware, the extraordinary European Council which took place in Lisbon on 23 and 34 March defined a new strategic objective for the Union intended to consolidate employment, economic reform and social cohesion<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It led to the development of a three-pronged strategy consisting, on the one hand, of facilitating the transition to a competitive knowledge-based economy and an information society for all, and, on the other hand, of consolidating and modernising the European Social Model by investing in human resources, promoting social inclusion and, lastly, by maintaining the conditions for healthy economic change and favourable growth prospects.</p>
<p>I would furthermore remind the honourable Member that the Commission has produced two major documents on the subject. Firstly, on 19 June 2000, the Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion<a href="#defann_10_3" name="refann_10_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, on 30 June 2000, the Commission addressed a Communication<a href="#defann_10_4" name="refann_10_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on a Social Policy Agenda to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p>The mandate conferred upon the French Presidency by the Lisbon European Council was the adoption of the European Social Agenda at the end of this year, and the Presidency has made it a top priority.</p>
<p>Hence, an informal meeting of Ministers for Employment and Social Policy has been under way in Paris since 8 July last, on the European Social Agenda and the fight against social exclusion, and this is evidence of the importance attached by the French Presidency to the fight against social exclusion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Presidency intends to implement the open method of coordination between Member States opted for at the Lisbon European Council, in order to give decisive impetus to the elimination of poverty and social exclusion. In this context, the French Presidency is endeavouring, within the framework of the High Level Group on Social Protection, to direct the work intended to allow the Nice European Council to adopt objectives to reduce poverty and social exclusion. This work takes into consideration the multidimensional nature of social exclusion and recognises the importance of other factors such as housing, education, health, leisure and culture as well as employment policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The already intolerable conditions prevailing in Turkish prisons are deteriorating and becoming still more inhuman as a result of the ‘white cells’ policy pursued by the Turkish Government and the new law governing prisons currently under construction. In addition to extensive isolation of prisoners, especially Kurds and other political prisoners, the new law crudely tramples underfoot any possibility there may have been of independent counsel, since it provides inter alia for physical searches of lawyers and the seizure of documents deemed by the authorities not to be relevant to the defence. In addition, a lengthy and time-consuming procedure is needed in order to deal with medical emergencies.</p>

<p>The living conditions of prisoners is clearly a human rights concern. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains provisions intended expressly to protect prisoners against abuse and ill-treatment. In addition, fundamental standards and principles have been established both at international level and by the Council of Europe on the treatment of prisoners.</p>
<p>The current Turkish prison system of 10-60 bed dormitories has led to prisoners having to be removed, sometimes bleeding, on several occasions in recent years.</p>
<p>These problems have prompted the Turkish Government to undertake a reform of the prison system, to bring in prison cells housing a maximum of three prisoners at a time.</p>
<p>From our point of view, the new Turkish prison system and its application should be more compliant with the international rules on the treatment of prisoners. The Council will monitor living conditions in Turkish prisons very carefully and will not hesitate to raise this and any other human rights issues with Turkey should these reforms not bring an improvement in the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0682"></a>

<p>The Commission established by the Paris Convention of 22 September 1992 for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, known as the OSPAR Convention, held its annual session in Copenhagen from 26 to 30 June 2000. The proceedings of that session do not fall within the remit of the Community. Moreover, France had not taken over the EU Presidency at that time.</p>
<p>Consequently, France does not have any particular information to give, as holder of the Presidency, in response to the question raised by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>However, speaking on its own behalf, it wishes to point out that 12 of the Member States of the OSPAR Commission supported a text concerning authorisations for the discharge and release of radioactive substances, which is not binding on France. This is because the Copenhagen meeting, which was held at senior official level, did not have the power to adopt new obligations that differ from those stemming from the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances adopted at the Sintra Ministerial Conference in 1998, the objective of which is to progressively reduce discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive substances with the aim of achieving, by 2020, levels for concentrations of artificial radioactive substances resulting from such discharges that are close to zero.</p>
<p>At Copenhagen, in an organisation where consensus is the traditional approach, a new text could only have been adopted with majority support.</p>
<p>The French delegation, like the UK delegation, considered the commitments the signatories were being asked to give regarding the reprocessing of radioactive waste to be unjustified and refused to support the decision. In accordance with the terms of the OSPAR Convention, the text applies to neither France nor to the UK.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0684"></a>

<p>The Council is aware of the crucial importance of the issue of water in the Middle East. Its efforts are directed towards the establishment of fair, lasting, general peace in the Middle East while endeavouring to encourage cooperation on water issues. This action is based on the substantial amount of work which has already been completed within the framework of the Barcelona Process, particularly the Plan of Action adopted by the second Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Local Water Management in Turin in 1999.</p>
<p>The 1994 Peace Treaty between Israel and Jordan was the first agreement providing for the division of water resources between Israel and one of its Arab neighbours. The water issue holds an important place in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations which are in progress on the Permanent Status. Moreover, any general regulation for the region will also have to include water management.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that, given the number of States bordering on the Jordan and its tributaries which have an interest in the river's water, regional cooperation will be the best long-term solution. On the basis of the projects supported by the European Community and its Member States in the region, the Council is attempting to promote arrangements along this line within the Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Council set up an ‘informal working group on water’ in Brussels, under the auspices of the EU Special Envoy for the Peace Process in the Middle East, Mr Moratinos, and co-chaired by the Commission. The 15 Member States are part of this working group. The group is currently chaired by Mr Walter Mattizzi, who also chairs the EMWIS Steering Committee within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.</p>
<p>The subject of water was chosen because of its importance for negotiations on the Permanent Status of the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>Ten meetings have taken place since 24 July 1998.</p>
<p>The initial results obtained by this working group include studies, such as the Franco-British report on the legal dimension of the water issue in the perspective of the Permanent Status and a British report on the possibilities for cooperation in the event of drought in the Jordan Basin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0690"></a>

Earlier this year Israel’s Mission to the EC reiterated this position publicly, stating that the borders of the State of Israel are nowhere defined in the EC-Israel agreements, and that ‘Israel defines its territoriality according to national law and issues certificates of origin accordingly’. Shortly thereafter, the Council decided to put into effect a new Association Agreement with Israel. As drafted, does this Agreement in fact allow Israel to conduct its treaty-based relations with the Community in a manner that violates key provisions of international law, as Israel claims?

<p>With regard to the territorial scope of the Association Agreement, Article 83 only applies to the 'territory of the State of Israel'. The term 'Israel' includes the territorial waters surrounding Israel and, subject to certain conditions, certain maritime shipping boats as well.

<p>The European Community considers that the Agreement only applies to the territory of the State of Israel within the framework of its borders recognised internationally in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>The European Community and its Member States continue to base their relations with Israel and the Palestinians on the principles of international law, including the 1949 fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War which bans settlements, among other things.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has implied, the Israeli authorities interpret the definition of the State of Israel differently and maintain that the issue of settlements must be regulated within the context of the Middle East peace process.

<p>As the honourable Member will recall, following the positive outcome of the elections held in Croatia early this year, which marked the end of a period of nationalism and isolation of this country, the Council immediately decided to request the Commission to produce a study on the possibility of opening negotiations with Croatia with a view to drawing up an association and stabilisation agreement between Croatia and the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission completed its feasibility study, which, in effect, recommended opening negotiations with Croatia, in May. On 13 June, the General Affairs Council requested the Commission to present a recommendation for a proposal for negotiating directives in July. This proposal for negotiating directives was adopted by the Commission in mid-July and submitted to the Council shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The responsible Council bodies are about to examine the Commission's recommendation with a view to the Council adopting it in the short term so that negotiations can commence as soon as possible. The French Presidency has given the dossier considerable priority in its programme and would like to see negotiations commence before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The opening of negotiations with a view to signing an association and stabilisation agreement with another western Balkan country - the honourable Member will be aware that negotiations are already under way with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - will send a strong political signal to other countries in this region such as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The European Union looks forward to the time when this country will also be able to participate fully in the association and stabilisation process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0693"></a>

<p>The Council recalls United Nations Security Council Resolution 353 (1974) which requires all States to respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. In particular, this resolution provides for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p>Apart from the above criteria, the Council expects all candidate countries to establish good relations with their neighbouring countries. In the case of Cyprus, the regulation process was launched under the auspices of the United Nations. The Council supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and expects all the parties to contribute to the success of these discussions so that a fair, long-lasting solution is found to the Cyprus question on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including the security-related issues and the presence of foreign troops on Cypriot territory.</p>
<p>The criteria for accession to the EU (Copenhagen criteria) are the same for all the candidate countries, including Turkey. The Council points out that a prior condition for the opening of accession negotiations is respect for the political criteria. The Feira European Council made its concerns on this point known. Turkey's pre-accession strategy includes increased political dialogue focusing on the political accession criteria, regarding, in particular, the issue of human rights and the concerns referred to in Paragraphs 4 and 4a of the Helsinki Conclusions. An accession partnership will be established for Turkey on the basis of the conclusions of the previous European Councils; it will define the priority areas of the preparations for accession with regard to the political and economic criteria and the obligations which a Member State must fulfil, and will be accompanied by a national programme for incorporating the acquis communautaire.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0701"></a>

<p>On 25 July 2000, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a new law on higher education which will permit the creation of private universities recognised by the Macedonian State. That law will establish a legal framework creating the conditions which will make it possible, in particular, to resolve the problem of access to high-quality higher education for the large Albanian community by permitting the establishment of private universities. This new policy, largely brought about by the Prime Minister, Mr Georgevski, and the President of the Democratic Party of Albanians in Macedonia, Mr Xhaferi, and by the OSCE Special Envoy, Mr Van der Stoel, will also make it possible to reintegrate into a normal course of education around 7000 Albanian students in Macedonia who have been studying at the unofficial University of Tetovo and who would otherwise have no prospects for the future and would become an easy prey for populists and supporters of a violent solution to the question of community relations in Macedonia.</p>

<p>As the honourable Member must surely be aware, the European Union is actively engaged in promoting the idea of multiethnic societies throughout the western Balkan region.

<p>In this respect, the new law on higher education recently adopted by the Parliament of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia represents a genuine step in the right direction. We welcome the determination and willingness shown by the political sector of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to cooperate on these sensitive issues. This is the sole and exclusive way forward.</p>
<p>The Council has not as yet been informed of Member States' decisions regarding contributions to the creation of a new university. We do, however, know that Mr Van der Stool of the OSCE has just arrived in the country in order to study a development plan for a private university together with the authorities responsible.

<p>The Council fully shares the honourable Member's concerns regarding the parliamentary elections that are to be held in Sri Lanka on 10 October 2000. As far back as January 2000, the heads of EU diplomatic missions in Colombo recommended that election observers be sent to the country in order to support the democratic process there. That recommendation was welcomed by the competent Council bodies.</p>
<p>The Commission sent a mission which, from 9 to 17 August, studied the conditions for organising an EU observer mission. Its report concludes that an observer mission could be organised and would be useful for reducing fraud which could invalidate the electoral process and increase tension between political parties.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan commissioner for elections gave the mission his verbal agreement, the conditions being those laid down in the terms of reference for EU observer missions (long-term mission, financial independence, freedom of movement).</p>
<p>The Council will study the results of the appraisal mission carefully and take a final decision as soon as possible. The working group responsible (COASI) is scheduled to examine this matter at its first meeting on 7 September. I can assure you that the safety of the observers, especially in the north of the country and in the conflict zone, will be a key factor in determining the European Union's position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0707"></a>

<p>The Court confirmed in the Abrahamsson case that there are certain circumstances in which positive action to promote women in sectors in which they are under-represented is compatible with Community legislation. The Court ruled that Article 2(1) and (4) of Directive 76/207 does not preclude national rules granting preference to candidates from the under-represented sex, provided that they possess equivalent or substantially equivalent merits and provided that candidatures are subjected to an objective assessment which takes account of the specific personal situations of all the candidates. This judgment is consistent with the Court’s judgments in cases C-450/93 Kalanke, C-409/95 Marschall and C-158/97 Badeck.</p>
<p>Article 2(4) of Directive 76/207 has now been superseded in that Article 141(4) of the Treaty gives Member States the facility “for maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers”. The Commission has submitted a proposal for a directive amending Directive 76/207. Under its proposal, the Commission is obliged to publish periodic assessments of measures adopted by Member States under Article 141(4). The assessments of national positive action will be useful to the Member States as examples of good practice. As I said, the Treaty grants the Member States the powers to adopt positive measures.

<p>During the implementation of the second CSF in Greece many shortcomings have been detected in vocational training (e.g. ineffective programmes, fraud in training centres), leading to an increase in unemployment of 11.7% in 1999.</p>
<p>Will the Commission call on the Greek authorities to take steps to assess the effectiveness of these centres, which are included under the third CSF, such as introducing compulsory assessment of training programmes both by the bodies responsible and the participants themselves and making the payment of funds to these centres conditional on a satisfactory number of trainees (say 70%) finding employment within a reasonable period of time once the programme has been completed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission analysed the employment situation in Greece while it was drafting the Joint Report on Employment 2000. Its analysis identified a complicated situation which needs to be dealt with in various ways. The labour market continues to demonstrate structural shortcomings, although the macro-economic situation in Greece has improved considerably and all the convergence criteria for accession to Economic and Monetary Union were met at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is right in maintaining that, apart from structural shortcomings which need to be dealt with, it is most important that efforts to improve the quality of education and training continue.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons why improving the quality and efficiency of actions in Greece funded jointly by the European Social Fund was a top priority for the Commission during previous programming periods for the Structural Funds and it will continue to be a sector which requires special attention during the new programming period for 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Commission, in agreement with the Greek Government, is therefore making provision under the new Community Support Framework (CSF) for a series of measures to ensure that:</p>
<p>a uniform system is adopted for assessing Social Fund activities,</p>
<p>certification activities - which commenced during the previous programming period with the creation of the EKEPIS (National Certification Centre for Vocational Training) - continue and are extended to include certification structures, instructors and training programmes,</p>
<p>a system of indicators is created for monitoring results from the point of view of physical achievement, financial return and impact. The results in the areas of job creation and the development of other training and education activities must be analysed so that they can be used when programming activities and deciding to continue (or stop) financial assistance,</p>
<p>general competitions for the provision of services are organised more quickly and become the rule,</p>
<p>controls are strengthened.</p>
<p>As regards conditionality, i.e. making funding for training centres conditional on trainees’ finding employment within a relatively short period of time of completing the course, this could in fact be applied in certain circumstances, as I have already mentioned. However, even if finding work is often the ultimate purpose in the case of various measures to develop human resources, there are occasions when preliminary training, training, advice, careers guidance and similar activities are an end in themselves and it is useful if certain persons can have access to them (e.g. persons with special needs, persons subject to social exclusion etc.).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0705"></a>

<p>The Commission has proposed cuts in the Preliminary Draft Budget 2001 to the budget line B3-4105 – for preparatory measures combating and preventing social exclusion. The cuts constitute more than EUR 5 million, or 1/3 of the budget line.</p>
<p>The Commission is proposing to cut this line in the same year that it is required to implement a new Community initiative under the same budget line.</p>
<p>This development seems to undermine the commitments made at the Lisbon Council earlier this year that action would be taken to tackle social exclusion. It also appears to be against the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty, which has given the EU, for the first time, the ability to tackle social exclusion.</p>
<p>Does the Commission feel that the resources which it has proposed in the Preliminary Draft Budget (and subsequently retained in the Draft Budget) for tackling social exclusion are sufficient to meet the EU’s recent commitments in this field?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>- The Commission believes that the proposed budget for Community action to contribute to combating social exclusion is adequate to cover the European Union’s commitments, and in particular the commitments undertaken at the recent Lisbon European Council.</p>
<p>- First, we should be aware of the fact that the Community contribution to combating social exclusion goes beyond the limits of budget line B3-4105, to which the honourable Member refers. In particular, the European Social Fund makes a large contribution.</p>
<p>- Secondly, the amount proposed by the Commission under this particular budget line for combating social exclusion (B3-4105) is sufficient to carry out the Community action programme which has recently been put forward (‘programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion’ <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0368">COM (2000) 368</a> final, 16 June 2000).</p>
<p>- The Commission’s proposal for 2001 is EUR 11 million, the same as for the 2000 Budget (also EUR 11 m). In addition, in the financial statement attached to the proposal for the above programme, the Commission emphasised that this amount was only the initial amount for the first year; the proposed amounts increase progressively to an annual EUR 15.5 m in 2003. In view of when the decision was approved and what has to be done before it is put into operation, the Commission anticipates lower costs for 2001 and a gradual increase in the programme’s activities in the following years.</p>
<p>- The obvious change in funding for social exclusion, to which the honourable Member’s question refers, is in fact due to the expiry of another budget line for cooperation with charitable non-governmental organisations (NGOs), namely budget line B3-4101, the amount for which came to EUR 5 m in 2000. Pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 October 1998 on legal bases and implementation of the budget, this line could only continue for three years for preparatory actions. Since 2000 is the third year of preparatory actions in this sector, the line could not be maintained in 2001. To guarantee continued cooperation with European Community NGOs, the Commission suggested that this cooperation should be supported within the framework of the two proposed Community programmes, for combating discrimination (put forward in 1999) and social exclusion (put forward in 2000). As a result, in the presentation of the 2001 Budget, the budget line for dialogue with civil society was merged with the budget line for social exclusion and the amounts from the previous years were also amalgamated, giving the impression that there had been a cut for 2001.</p>
<p>- It should be noted that our proposals for combating discrimination and social exclusion include funding for EU-level non-governmental organisations which operate in these fields, with particular emphasis on core funding for European NGOs up to a total of EUR 5.8 m for 2001. This confirms the Commission’s wish to support dialogue with civil society. I hope, therefore, that the Council and Parliament will work to ensure that these programmes are approved as soon as possible so that these proposals may be put into practice. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0706"></a>

<p>The directive on working time should have been implemented by 23 November 1996. The competent Danish authorities notified the Commission of their national implementing measures as regards both legislative acts and collective bargaining agreements in February 1997. The issue to which the honourable Member refers concerns the implementation of directives via collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>It is important in this connection to remember the case law of the European Court. The Court has made it clear that, where the directive is implemented via collective bargaining agreements, the Member State concerned must be able to guarantee the results required under the directive in question.</p>
<p>More importantly, all workers who come within the scope of the directive must enjoy the full protection which is granted under the various provisions of the directive.</p>
<p>The Commission sent an official letter on the subject of the implementation of the working time directive in Denmark to the Danish authorities at the end of 1999. We are still in contact with the authorities with a view to clarifying the extent to which they have implemented certain provisions of the directive in a way which ensures that all workers are able to exercise their rights in full. I personally met the Danish minister Mr Hygum in the spring and discussed this matter with him, following which the Commission wrote to the minister again on 20 July asking for more information.</p>

<p>The 1996 Cork Declaration on rural development called for more encouragement to be given to using financial engineering in order to reduce financial constraints on small and medium-sized enterprises, promote productive investment, diversify rural economies and assure a greater participation by the banking sector and other fiscal intermediaries.</p>
<p>In accordance with this declaration, the new Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) foresees under its Article 33, last indent, a specific measure designed to promote financial engineering.</p>
<p>It is, however, too early to make an assessment of the above-mentioned measure: all rural development programming documents for the period 2000-2006 submitted to the Commission by the Member States in application of this regulation have not yet been approved and we are only at the beginning of the 2000-2006 programming period. This assessment will be done later on by the mid-term and ex-post evaluations which should be performed in consultation with the Commission under the responsibility of the national authorities in charge of the rural development programming.</p>
<p>In the light of the already approved rural development programming documents, the only conclusion the Commission can draw at this time is that this specific measure concerning "financial engineering" has not been used by all Member States, some of them preferring to implement more traditional aid schemes such as investment aid to farmers or support to the processing and marketing of agricultural products.</p>
<p>Given the innovative aspect of "financial engineering", the rural development programmes financed by the new Community Initiative for Rural Development (LEADER +), which will be approved in the coming months are, however, likely to make more use of this measure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0644"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the damage caused by the forest fires which have ravaged parts of Greece. However, it is not yet in possession of sufficiently detailed information to be able to evaluate the extent of the disaster in the different regions of Greece, including Samos.</p>
<p>Within the Community support framework (CSF) for Community structural assistance to Greece, the EU Structural Funds are contributing the very substantial sum of EUR 26 027 million for the period 2000 to 2006. This includes the EAGGF contribution of EUR 2 260.3 million.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of forestry production potential in Greece could be supported by the EAGGF on the basis of the regulation on rural development (Regulation 1257/1999).</p>
<p>However, the EAGGF financial appropriations, as recorded by the Greek authorities within the Community Support Framework, are not sufficient to constitute a large enough contribution to the major work necessary to remedy the damage caused by this disaster. The Greek authorities could present official proposals to amend the development programme in order to make available the necessary appropriations.</p>
<p>With regard to the purchasing of fire-fighting material to fight forest fires in Greece, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund have already made substantial contributions, during the period 1994-1999 (CSF 2). This is also a case in which it is the responsibility of the national authorities to stipulate in the current programme for the period 2000-2006 the monies necessary to strengthen this action.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission would like to draw the honourable Member's attention to the fact that there is a specific regulation (2158/92) promoting fire prevention actions.</p>
<p>In general and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the responsibility of the Member State to ensure that all possible public awareness-raising measures and upkeep, brushwood clearance, forest surveillance and specialist training measures are developed in order to reduce the risk of fire to the very minimum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0658"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of this article and the study it is based on. The methodology of the study may be correct, however, certain key information to understand its outcome correctly has not been explained. The Commission has sent a letter to the editor of the Financial Times which pointed out three major issues for wrong interpretation.</p>
<p>1. The econometric model used is not able to distinguish between different instruments of income support. Thus, it fails to capture the positive impact of shifting from price support to direct income payments.</p>
<p>2. The study remains obscure as regards the timeframe of the analysis. It appears very likely that the study used 1995 (or even earlier) data, which hardly can take account of the 1992 CAP reforms.</p>
<p>3. The study uses as a reference a scenario without any farm support. This is of little relevance in a real-world analysis. The American Government, for instance, has recently adopted an additional farm subsidy package of USD 15 billion, while the Community is continuing to reform its agricultural policy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission agrees that there is a need to analyse carefully the impact of the common agricultural policy (CAP) distortion effects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0672"></a>

<p>The European Parliament has been considering the issue of measures to safeguard beekeeping in Europe since 1985.</p>
<p>However, our efforts and the report on the Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘Discussion paper on the situation of beekeeping in Europe’ (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=94&amp;nu_doc=0256">COM(94)0256</a> – C4-0108/94) adopted unanimously by Parliament in January 1995 have thus far led only to the adoption of the regulation on measures to improve the production and marketing of honey (Regulation (EC) 1221/97 of 25 June 1997)<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Since beekeeping is declining ever more disastrously in many regions, could Commissioner Fischler state whether he is prepared to put forward proposals for direct aid measures, as urged by me in the January 1995 report and as unanimously approved by Parliament in the form of amendments set out in my report of June 1997 on the proposal for a regulation, namely a pollination premium, compensatory payments for loss of income and the incorporation of beekeeping in the regulation on measures to improve the efficiency of agricultural structures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After three years of national programmes under this regulation, the Commission has just started to prepare the report. Both national administrations and beekeepers' organisations have been asked to submit written information on the experience gained with the new aid scheme, including identification of needs for future actions.</p>
<p>Without prejudging the results of the analyses to be carried out in the framework of this report, the data at present available to the Commission do not confirm the opinion of the honourable Member that "the development of beekeeping in many regions becomes more and more catastrophic".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Equality of treatment for men and women is indeed an important area covered by negotiations under chapter 13, Social policy and Employment. The Commission confirms that the acquis in relation to equal opportunities and women’s rights is discussed in the context of accession negotiations with the candidate countries. Poland accepts the acquis and has not requested any transitional periods in this area. Consequently, Poland is expected to be able to meet its declared objective to implement the acquis by 31 December 2002.</p>
<p>As a relevant matter of principle in the negotiations, the Community underlines the importance of the social dimension of the Community, as reinforced under the Amsterdam Treaty, and emphasises that from the date of accession, timely and complete transposition and implementation of the social policy and employment acquis will be required. The acquis includes also the Joint Action (of 24 February 1997) concerning action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p>Particular attention is given to enforcement of women’s rights, such as effective access to information on existing legal rights and the number of discrimination cases going to Court. Concerning the relevant Community programmes, they remain open for Polish participation upon request.</p>
<p>One objective of the STOP programme is to increasingly involve the candidate countries. Although it is not yet formally open for Poland, several Polish entities, public services as well as non governmental organisations (NGOs), have participated in projects under the STOP Programme. As regards the DAPHNE Initiative, entities from Poland have also participated in several projects.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the view of the honourable Member regarding the importance of the role played by the social economy in employment and economic policy. This role will continue to be recognised by the various Community policies.</p>
<p>For its part, the newly restructured 'Enterprise' Directorate-General (DG) will have one unit, which will be responsible, in particular, for entrepreneurial issues affecting cooperatives and mutual societies. This unit will be the interlocutor for social economy enterprises and will act as the interface with the other departments of the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission's activities in promoting and supporting the social economy are part of a wider approach and also involve other departments, including the different lines of action pursued by the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs in support of employment and the social economy - for example, through activities linked to the pilot action ‘The Third System and Employment’ (1997-99) created upon Parliament's initiative.</p>
<p>In order to make dialogue with the different operators of the business world more effective and transparent, the ‘Enterprise’ DG's general intention is to complete reorganisation of its departments by restructuring its many working parties and consultative committees with different mandates into a single working party. This would imply abolishing the Consultative Committee for cooperatives, mutual societies, associations and foundations (CMAF) in its current form.</p>
<p>This being the case, the Commission is in the process of ascertaining the most appropriate flexible and open formulas for improving technical exchanges with social economy operators, drawing upon the CMAF's experience. The aim of the envisaged changes is to improve the quality of the relations traditionally maintained with the entrepreneurs of the social economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0608"></a>

<p>In addition to the principles of protection enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, there are two European directives ensuring the protection of personal data, i.e. firstly Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and secondly, Directive 97/66/EC of 15 December 1997 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector.</p>
<p>Article 5 of Directive 97/66/EC stipulates that Member States are to ensure, via national regulations, the confidentiality of communications by means of a public telecommunications network and publicly available telecommunications services and that, in particular, they shall prohibit any kind of interception or surveillance of communications. Article 14.1 of the same directive authorises Member States to adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope of the data protection principles provided for in the directive when such restriction constitutes a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defence, public security or the prosecution of criminal offences. </p>
<p>In implementation of the Treaty, the Commission must monitor the actual implementation of the directives within the Member States, and, in particular, the proportionality of the legislative measures adopted on the basis of the above-mentioned Article 14.1.

<p>The Commission recently made formal contact with the Swedish Government on the subject of the higher tax imposed on wine than on beer in Sweden. On that occasion, the Swedish Government replied that it intended, in Autumn 2000, to present proposals with a view to reducing the taxation on wine. For the moment therefore, the Commission is awaiting concrete action from the Swedish Government.</p>
<p>The honourable Member also mentions the very low tax on wine – zero tax or very low tax – in Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Portugal and France, in comparison with the tax on beer. In this respect, the Commission wishes to draw attention to the fact that Community legislation, in Directive 92/84/EEC on the harmonisation of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic drinks, provides for the possibility of a differentiation of excise duties in favour of wine, laying down a minimum level of EUR 0 per hectolitre of finished product in the case of wine and an above zero level for beer. Community legislation has thereby allowed beer to be more heavily taxed than wine. The Court of Justice, in its judgement of 17 June 1999 on case C-166/98, ‘Société critouridienne de distribution’, considered that such a situation cannot be viewed as being incompatible with the Treaty. There is therefore no need for action on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two situations, that of Sweden and that of the other above-mentioned Member States are not comparable. In fact, the difference in taxation which may exist in the latter States between wine and beer does not seem likely to produce discrimination on an intra-Community level since those countries produce as much wine as beer. On the other hand, since Sweden only produces beer, there is likely to be discrimination against wine originating from other Member States.</p>
<p>On the basis of Article 8 of the above-mentioned directive, at the beginning of 2001, the Commission will present a report on the excise duties applicable to alcoholic drinks taking particular account of the competition between the different categories of alcoholic drinks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0623"></a>

<p>On 14 June 2000, accession negotiations in the field of agriculture were opened with Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. On this occasion, the Community presented its Common Positions with regard to agriculture, which among many other issues clarify the Community’s position with regard to transitional periods and direct payments in the field of agriculture.</p>
<p>The Community’s general position as regards transitional periods, which also applies in the field of agriculture, is that transitional measures must be exceptional, limited in time and scope and accompanied by a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the acquis. Transitional periods must not involve amendments to the rules or policies of the Community, disrupt their proper functioning or lead to significant distortions of competition. In the field of agriculture, the candidate countries request a significant number of transitional measures, the scope, nature and objectives of which are very varied. Each of these requests will need to be appraised in detail in order to ensure that it is necessary, appropriate and does not put into question the acceptance of the acquis by the new Member States. In many cases, the Community therefore requests further detailed information from the candidate countries in order to allow for a full assessment of the request.</p>
<p>All the above mentioned six candidate countries request that direct payments be granted fully to their farmers immediately after accession.

<p>Two external evaluations were launched on the first phase of the SOCRATES programme (1995-1999): an intermediate evaluation carried out in 1997-1998, and a final evaluation launched in 1999 and which is being completed. It is foreseen that the Commission report on the implementation of the first phase of the SOCRATES programme, based on these external evaluations, will be submitted to the Parliament and to the Council before the end of this year. The report will provide more thorough answers to the questions asked by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>However, some elements are already available from the intermediate evaluation and the statistics gathered by the Commission and the National Agencies in the participating countries: Approximately 15,000 schools have participated in European Education Projects funded under Comenius Action 1; more than 5,000 teachers have attended a Comenius Action 3.2 in-service training course during the period 1995-1999; the European Education Projects funded under Comenius Action 1 show a positive impact on schools, pupils and teachers, with results such as the acquisition of new skills and knowledge (in particular skills related to the use of information and communication technology and social skills), the improvement of co-operation at school level and between the school and the local community, a stronger inter-disciplinary approach to teaching and learning, and a clearer European dimension. These results do contribute to the quality of school education.</p>
<p>As regards the publications, the Commission has published two reports on the implementation and results of the Socrates programme: an interim report on the first two years of the programme’s implementation and the formal interim evaluation report. Both of these reports are available in all 11 languages.</p>
<p>As regards the interaction between Comenius activities and national school systems, the final evaluation will focus primarily on the impact of the programme, relative to its overall objectives.</p>
<p>The Decision establishing the second phase of the Socrates programme (2000-2006) provides for closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in the field of evaluation. Evaluation and monitoring activities are due to be reinforced during the whole implementation of the programme. Each of the Member States will also provide two assessment reports, in particular with a view to obtain a more complete picture of the programme’s contribution to enhancing educational quality in each of the countries concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0631"></a>

<p>Directive 98/44/EC<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions which allows elements isolated from the human body to be patented, has already been the subject of several actions before the Court of Justice.

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the debates that may arise from Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions.</p>
<p>The section concerning the patentability of elements isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process is probably the most sensitive of all.</p>
<p>The preamble to the directive clearly states the principle according to which the right to patents must be exercised with respect for the fundamental principles guaranteeing human dignity and integrity. The ethical considerations have been present throughout the adoption process of this text and have been the basis of the options put forward by the Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>Thus, pursuant to the directive, the human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, including germ cells, as well as the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the gene sequence or partial gene sequence, cannot constitute patentable inventions. It follows that neither the human genome in its natural state nor the fundamental raw data relating to the human genome constitute patentable inventions.</p>
<p>The directive’s provisions on this issue, however, which are the fruit of many years of negotiations in the Council and in Parliament, lay down that these elements, including the gene sequence or partial gene sequence, if isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, can constitute a patentable invention.</p>
<p>Any patent for an invention based on a gene - or comprising a gene – however, must comply with the usual patentability requirements, according to which the invention must be novel, involve an inventive step and be capable of industrial application. These basic principles, on which all patent rights are based, have proven to be flexible enough to adapt to technological progress. In particular, the concepts defining what constitutes an inventive step, or the level of disclosure required to demonstrate an industrial application, evolve with technology. For example, whereas considerable effort and skill were required to isolate or produce the first genes, these activities are now almost routine.</p>
<p>The directive does not replace the traditional requirements to disclose inventions but aims to provide important supplementary guidance regarding the manner in which the latter must be implemented in this particular technological field.</p>
<p>As for the matter of industrial applicability of inventions comprising or based on genes, the directive reiterates that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences, including those relating to genes, cannot be patented if they do not have a specific industrial application.</p>
<p>At the request of the Commission, in September 1996, the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology published a specific opinion on the ethical implications of the patentability of inventions concerning elements of human origin.</p>
<p>The Group recognises that patent rights are one of the incentives for medical research, and compensate the effort put into research. The Group notes, however, that biotechnological inventions, where they concern elements of human origin, involve fundamental human rights and respect for human dignity.</p>
<p>This is why the Group has emphasised that the examination of patentability criteria must take account of ethical principles as well as the normal technical requirements of novelty, inventiveness and industrial application. In particular, the free, informed consent of the person from whom the samples are taken is essential (point 2.4 of the opinion). An invention drawn from the use of elements of human origin without respecting the principle of consent, would therefore not comply with ethical requirements.</p>
<p>The human body and its elements cannot constitute patentable inventions, not only because they do not comply with the normal technical criteria for patentability, but also by virtue of the principle of non-commercialisation of the human body. This principle also excludes the payment of persons from whom a sample has been taken.</p>
<p>With regard to inventions arising from knowledge of a gene or partial gene sequence, the first ethical question is that of sharing knowledge in human genetics, knowledge which, under the terms of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome, adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation (UNO) in 1998 is, symbolically, a part of the heritage of all mankind.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology has considered that the issue of a patent is only acceptable if the identification of the function attached to the gene or gene sequence clears the way for new possibilities such as the manufacture of a new medicinal product, and if the application giving rise to a patent is sufficiently specific and adequately identified (point 2.5 of the opinion). Such an invention, concerning an element isolated from the human body, is in fact the result of the technical procedures that identified, purified and classified that element and multiplied it outside the human body, techniques that only human beings are able to implement and that nature is incapable of accomplishing alone.</p>
<p>The directive, admittedly, does not in itself provide all the answers and indeed, this was not its objective or ambition. The directive, if we attach the well-established principles of patent rights to it, constitutes a legal framework that is sufficiently clear and balanced for patent protection in this rapidly-developing technological field. This is why the Commission does not at this stage plan to begin further discussions regarding this directive. Naturally, it will continue to follow developments in this field very closely, in particular those relating to the transposition and implementation of the directive into national legislation, and will update the Council and the Parliament regularly on the situation’s progress.</p>

<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the issue of social dumping in the maritime transport sector. It is for this reason that on 29 April 1998 the Commission adopted a Communication on a common policy on manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between Member States with two “manning proposals” attached: a proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Council Regulation on maritime cabotage<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1 and a proposal for a Council Directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed directive is to ensure that third-country nationals when employed on board ferries operating a regular service between Member States will benefit from labour conditions comparable to those enjoyed by Community nationals. The Commission considers that by imposing Community standards for seafarers the directive will prevent social dumping in this sector and the distortion of competition brought about by the employment of third-country seafarers at non-Community wages. It will prevent further replacement of seafarers by cheap third country nationals and will maintain the job opportunities for Community seafarers by preserving one of the last remaining significant sectors of employment of Community seafarers.</p>
<p>The two “manning proposals” were discussed in the framework of the Council and of the Parliament, which delivered an opinion on a first reading on the two “manning proposals” on 12 March 1999. This opinion was confirmed on 16 September 1999 and consequently, on 13 July 2000, the Commission adopted an amended proposal for a Directive of the Parliament and the Council on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States.</p>
<p>In any event, it goes without saying that competition in the maritime sector cannot ignore the Community’s social acquis, which must be fully respected. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The objective of the aid granted by Member States to the coal industry has, for several years, been to minimise the social and regional consequences of the restructuring and reduction of activity which is inevitable in that sector. Any transitional system of aid to the coal industry, which would be likely to enter into force on the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, should also take account of environmental guidelines, and, in particular, the commitments made at Kyoto with a view to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Such a system should also deal with the problems on a Community level as a whole, particularly with a view to preventing distortions in competition which might be contrary to the common interest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission should, in the months to come, adopt a Green Paper on safety in the supply of energy, which will assess, along with other sources of energy, the role to be played by coal in an enlarged Europe.

<p>The Commission has fifteen Representations in the capital cities of the member states and eight that are regionally based. They are quite distinct from Commission Delegations which represent the Commission vis-à-vis third countries and international organisations and which help to manage Community aid programmes.</p>
<p>The eight Commission Representations outside the fifteen capital cities were established in order to provide information adapted to the requirements of the areas they served, especially those far away from the Representation in the capital. They were designed to respond to a perceived local need.</p>
<p>When these Representations were established their key priority, like that in the Representations based in the capitals, was the provision of information. Other than European Documentation Centres, situated within Universities, there were at that time very few sources of information about the Community apart from the Representations themselves and the Offices of the Parliament with whom they co-operate closely. In the last ten years, a different approach has been adopted designed to make information available at as local a level as possible. This is carried out through partnerships developed with the Member States who have a primary responsibility in the matter of information.</p>
<p>One of the main means of diffusing information at this level are Euro-Info points, designed to provide public information. Within the Basque autonomous territory a Euro-Info point is situated at Vitoria. In addition, there are other information networks such as the "Carrefours," specially designed to meet the needs of rural areas and deal with agricultural matters in particular. One of these is situated at Maeztu in Alava. This reflects the current priority of concentrating on the establishment of truly local outlets for providing Community information, where possible by using existing networks such as public libraries.</p>
<p>Following the recent restructuring of the Commission's services, the Commission is reflecting on the role of the Representations in the Member States with a view to clarifying their priorities. The Commission will keep the Parliament informed of the new role it intends to give to the Representations in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0646"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the phenomenon known as ‘air rage’ and of the studies carried out both in the United States and in some Member States, particularly the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Commission acknowledges, however, the need for vigilance and fully backs the initiatives to improve the training of crews and to spread good practice appropriate for preventing and containing incidents of this kind.</p>

<p>In the same way, the proposal for a directive on safety requirements and attestation of professional competence for cabin crews<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> provides that cabin crews must have completed training on the handling of aggressive passengers (see Annex I to the proposal).</p>

<p>Community legislation contributes largely to a sustainable development of the marine environment. This concerns the fight against eutrophication by nutrients input to the marine environment from agricultural sources and from waste water sources (as set out in relevant Directives<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the obligation under the forthcoming Water Framework Directive to achieve 'good status' for all waters including the coastal waters within a set deadline, as well as the phasing-out of certain hazardous substances.</p>
<p>Community legislation is, where appropriate, complemented by agreements under International Law. As an example, reference can be made to the decisions taken by the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the North-East Atlantic on the protection of biodiversity and on the ban on the dumping at sea of disused offshore platforms.</p>
<p>As regards the traditional fish resources on the Irish shelf, most of these are currently exploited to the extent that show signs of over-exploitation or are fully utilised.</p>
<p>Recent information from scientists also shows that the deep sea fish resources are in a serious state as well. The Commission is very concerned on the state of deep sea stocks and for its part is considering the setting up of Total allowable catches (TACs) next year. Many of the stocks concerned extend beyond Community waters, and action by Community alone would not be sufficient to conserve those stocks. The Commission has therefore again requested a discussion, on the management of these resources, at the next meeting of the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission.</p>
<p>Marine resources represent an important economic factor in the Community. Around 70 000 enterprises, most of them small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), operate along Europe’s coasts, generating an annual turnover of EUR 20 billion. Marine industries and services contribute to almost 5% of the Community’s wealth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission promotes development and innovation in this important industry, in particular by supporting and assisting the specialist panel on marine resources and the research and development (R&amp;D) Co-ordination group of the Maritime Industries Forum in their participation in the relevant key actions of the 5<span class="sup">th</span> R&amp;D Framework Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Intellectual property systems provide incentives to encourage investment and innovation. When it comes to the use of biodiversity in the process of creating new inventions, it should be noted that not only commercial aspects play a role but ethical and environmental concerns may also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Articles 27.2 and 27.3 of the TRIPs (Trade related aspects of intellectual property rights) Agreement provide flexibility for exclusions from patentability in case where countries consider it necessary, e.g. to exclude plants and animals from patentability. It is up to individual Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to implement the provisions as they see fit and they should find a balance between ensuring legal protection and ethical, moral, environmental and other societal domestic values. In doing so, WTO members must respect the minimum requirements of the TRIPs Agreement.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights do not, either at international (TRIPs) or at domestic level, aim to regulate the production, distribution and access to genetic resources. Neither do they regulate the terms and conditions for bioprospecting. This is a matter for regulation by domestic legislation or by appropriate international legislation such as the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic resources (IU), currently re-negotiated within the FAO or other instruments under the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>In this context, intellectual property rights are instruments, but not the only ones, used by providers of genetic material to obtain a commercial return. Patents can be used as an instrument between the parties to these agreements to secure remuneration to the provider country for the use of genetic resources on a long term basis.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is important to support co-operation on mutually agreed terms between providers of genetic material and the research-based industry. This may enable both parties, through monetary compensation and other means (knowledge sharing, technology transfer, education programmes etc.) to ensure a sustainable exploitation of a country's resources. Several companies are already engaged in such co-operation and have committed themselves, on a long-term basis, to provide training, know-how and common sharing of benefits to developing countries, in return for access to resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Community is prepared to strengthen co-operation with developing countries in this area as foreseen, for example, in the Cotonou-Agreement with ACP countries. In this context the Community is prepared to support upon request “the preparation of laws and regulations for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, the prevention of the abuse of such rights by rightholders and the infringement of such rights by competitors, the establishment and reinforcement of domestic and regional offices”.</p>
<p>Against this background, and because of the existing potential use of the TRIPs Agreement, the Commission considers that there is no need, currently, to amend the text of the Agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0661"></a>

<p>By proposing the simple solution of a modest tax on all exchange transactions, Professor Tobin raised a fundamental problem and sparked off the crucial debate on the domination of the economy by finance and its intrinsic instability. However, what seemed a simple solution to a real problem comes up against two types of obstacles: on the one hand, the economic distortions caused by such a tax and, on the other, the problems relating to its application.</p>
<p>Given that it is impossible to distinguish between purely speculative operations and operations relating to a real transaction, the Tobin tax would have to be applied to all of these operations. Now, in order to be effective and discourage speculative movements, such a tax would have to be set at a high level. In this case, it would also hit the underlying genuine transactions, and thereby create an obstacle to commercial development. If the tax were not to restrict transactions considered as beneficial, it would have to be set at a low level. However, it would only represent a negligible cost for speculative transactions, since they produce very high profits. It would not therefore reduce speculative transactions. Furthermore, experience has not shown that the financial markets would become more efficient as a result of introducing taxes on transactions. The experience of the Interest Equalisation Tax, which is a type of Tobin tax applied previously in the United States, has led to the creation of the Euromarket, that is to say a parallel market.</p>
<p>This raises questions about the difficulties involved in the application of a tax on financial transactions. It would have to be established on an international level to be effective and prevent the possibility of evasion. Given the difficulties encountered by the Member States in reaching an agreement merely on the minimal aspects of fiscal coordination within the Community, reaching an agreement on an international basis would appear to be a particularly ambitious objective.</p>
<p>Finally, there are doubts as to the compatibility of such a tax with the freedoms laid down in the EC Treaty, in particular regarding the prohibition of restrictions on movements of capital.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0678"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that the demand for a tax on financial transactions is a sensitive subject for some MEPs, committees and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Europe. The Commission is also sensitive to the substantive issues raised, such as that mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>However, the Commission wonders to what extent a tax on financial transactions would ‘restore a desirable balance between the respective roles of man and the world of finance’.</p>
<p>If that means that such a tax would bring in public funds intended to fund large investment projects, its function would effectively be to contribute to the development of certain less-developed regions. Moreover, it would have to be ensured that the measure were not counteracted by a parallel reduction in the existing measures in aid for development.</p>
<p>However, if the restoration of balance consisted of discouraging speculative financial movements, the result of introducing such a tax does not appear to be guaranteed. In fact, economists agree that the effect of a Tobin tax on the amounts traded would be marginal and that it would therefore not contribute in any significant way to the desired restoration of balance through a reduction in the world of finance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0666"></a>

<p>Environment has high priority in the accession negotiations. In its general position for the Accession Conference opening of the negotiations, the Community has explicitly underlined the need to ensure a high level of environmental protection and in fact, the negotiating positions of the Community lay down a clear strategy to achieve this objective. This includes in particular giving priority to the transposition and implementation of industry-related legislation, including legislation on waste management and legislation against transboundary pollution. In addition, the Community has called in its negotiating positions for all new investments in the candidate countries to comply with the environmental acquis already during the pre-accession period. Furthermore, the Commission has financed projects in order to assist the Czech Republic to transpose and implement Community waste legislation, which will support the sustainable waste management in the Czech Republic. A variety of assistance has been given to the Czech Republic to analyse the gaps between the existing legislation and Community waste legislation and a twinning project under PHARE 2000 has been agreed which will assist the Czech Republic to set up a Waste Management Centre and to draft a national waste management strategy.</p>
<p>Agenda 2000 lays down the criteria for membership of the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The criteria include adopting and implementing the Community’s legal acts. Recognising that this would be a major task in environment, but aware of the need to avoid an “environmental gap” between the member states and the candidate countries, Agenda 2000 calls for realistic strategies for compliance with Community legislation, and concrete funding plans for implementation. Therefore, under Agenda 2000, pre-accession aid and new instruments to assist candidate countries in the costs of accession have been foreseen. Among these, the "Instrument structurel de pré-adhésion" (ISPA instrument) allows, among others, to provide financial assistance for environmental infrastructure investment. Furthermore, Phare allows funding of municipal infrastructure and industry related investments in clean-up and reduction of hazardous waste and emissions. However, as the Commission also stressed in Agenda 2000, the funding gap cannot be covered solely by the pre-accession aid. Important domestic and foreign financial resources, in particular from the private sector, will have to be mobilised in support of strategies for compliance with Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0667"></a>

<p>The law pertaining to copyright in computer programs has already been harmonized by virtue of Council Directive 91/250 on the legal protection of computer programs which has been in force since 1993. Computer programs are protected by copyright to the extent that they constitute original works. Under the Directive, protection is accorded if the program is original in the sense that it is the author’s own intellectual creation. The Directive provides for a decompilation exception in order to allow for achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program.</p>
<p>Patents for software-related inventions have been available for many years. However, the current legal provisions on the issue are different in the Community, the United States and Japan. Furthermore, the case law which interprets these provisions is not uniform.

<p>The main objective of the "eLearning: Designing Tomorrow's Education" initiative<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> is to mobilise the educational and cultural communities, as well as the economic and social players in Europe, in order to speed up innovation and change in the education and training systems. eLearning has been developed in response to the Lisbon European Council ’s request for the Community to move quickly towards a knowledge-based society and to the recognition of the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to raise educational and training standards in an innovative way. eLearning has identified four priority action lines : infrastructures and equipment; training; content and services, and the networking of relevant projects and initiatives at the European level.</p>
<p>eLearning, as eEurope, is a joint action plan of the Commission and of Member States. On the community side, its implementation will take place via existing programmes and instruments including in particular education and training programmes, structural funds, and the 5<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme – Information Society Technologies Programme (IST) addressing research and technological development on technologies for education and training, through new approaches to lifelong learning, and innovative ways of integrating multimedia pedagogic material.</p>
<p>Other Commission actions supporting the European content industry, such as the new financing possibilities of the European Investment Bank, will also support the promotion of the eLearning initiative. Finally, the Commission supports standardisation initiatives carried out within the European standardisation organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) to foster the further implementation of learning technologies and educational software in the context of eEurope and may consider to financially support further implementation of the agreed work programme.</p>
<p>Following the presentation of eLearning to the Education Council on 8 June, 2000 and its endorsement by the Feira European Council on 20 June, 2000, the preparation of the interservice cooperation framework required for its implementation has been launched. The eLearning work programme, a working document of the Commission covering the full range of actions and related sources and amount of funding in each of the four priority action lines, is scheduled for approval in October 2000, in time for its presentation to the Education Council in November. Preparatory actions will start in 2000. The eLearning initiative should be fully operational as from 2001.</p>
<p>Other than the total budget allocated to the eLearning initiative within the existing programmes, it can be said that line B3-1000 will deal with innovative actions, with an emphasis on the development of new educational services and on the generalisation of access to new technologies. These will also include, for example, the development of new partnerships between the private and the public sectors, and the establishment of European networks which promote innovation and cooperation at all levels of education, including lifelong learning and informal education. In the preliminary draft budget for 2001, this line has been allocated EUR 2 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Within the framework of the trade war on hormones, the United States have been imposing, since 29 July 1999, customs duties of 100% on certain Community products. Canada has also been imposing commercial sanctions since 1 August 1999 for the same reason.</p>
<p>All the Member States have been victims of these sanctions, apart from the United Kingdom, who the United States has decided to exempt unilaterally from the application of their measures (which, on the other hand, is not the case for the ‘banana’ sanctions). The most recent information indicates that the trade in all the products in question has been affected very considerably. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that a reduction in commercial movements does not necessarily sufficiently reflect the real impact of the American sanctions on Community businesses, whose long-term commercial relations are severely affected. In the particular case of pork, to which the honourable Member refers, their imports to the USA have been substantially affected, as well as those of tomatoes and fruit juices.</p>
<p>This situation is likely to change very soon, since the United States is on the point of amending the list of sanctions in accordance with the new ‘Carrousel’ legislation, which is intended to increase the punitive nature of commercial sanctions well beyond the level laid down in the WTO rules, and to this effect the Community has immediately invoked a procedure for the settlement of disputes within the WTO.</p>
<p>The Commission remains determined to resolve, once and for all, the dispute which gave rise to these sanctions as soon as possible. In the Spring, the Commission adopted a proposal, based on the available scientific data, to amend the Community legislation on the use of hormones. Once adopted by Parliament and the Council, this proposal will bring our commercial regulations completely into line with the WTO rules.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, the Commission is also exploring the possibility of commercial compensation with the United States.</p>
<p>The Commission is not, however, in a position to take other measures to assist European businesses which are victims of the American authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0694"></a>

<p>The Member States have confirmed that the ECSC Treaty will expire in July 2002. One of the consequences of its disappearance will be the dismantling of the consultative committee currently responsible for holding the structured social dialogue.</p>
<p>It follows that, as of 2002, the coal and steel sectors will be governed by the EC Treaty, in line with the other sectors of the economy and industry.</p>
<p>The transfer of the two sectors involved to the common legislative system means that it will now be the Economic and Social Committee’s (ESC) responsibility to carry out the consultative function and to provide the framework for dialogue and social consultation. On this point, it should be noted that in its resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) of 13 April 2000, Parliament asked that the functioning of the ESC should be adapted to strengthen its role as a framework for social dialogue and liaison with civil society.</p>
<p>However, the Commission fully acknowledges that the expertise gained by the ECSC over almost fifty years is unique and must be preserved. The ESC should take account of the high quality of the opinions delivered by the consultative committee and the body’s consensus culture.</p>
<p>In line with these considerations, the Commission has begun discussions with consultative committee representatives from the ECSC and the ESC in order to look at various suggestions on the most suitable way of ensuring that the coal and steel sectors are adequately represented in this forum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0699"></a>

<p>As the Commission pointed out in its reply to the honourable Member’s Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2000-0999_EN.html">E-0999/00</a>, the freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States is governed by Council Regulation 3577/92 of 7 December 1992<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises, following discussions with the Scottish authorities, that many of the maritime routes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland would not be operated, or operated to the same extent, if the shipping company in question were considering its own commercial interest. The Commission also fully appreciates the importance of these ferry services for the economy and social cohesion of the region. It was with this kind of situation in mind that Regulation 3577/92 provides, in Article 4, that a Member State may conclude public service contracts, or impose public service obligations, in a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners, on shipping companies participating in regular services to, from and between islands. In imposing such public service obligations, Member States are limited to requirements concerning ports to be served, regularity, continuity, frequency, capacity to provide the service, rates to be charged and manning of the vessel.</p>
<p>The imposition of public service obligations is a restriction on the freedom to provide services. The Commission is therefore under an obligation to ensure that this possibility is interpreted in a restrictive manner and permitted only in cases of proven necessity. In principle, this interpretation would not be affected by the fact that the maritime routes under consideration form part of an intermodal chain. After detailed examination and bearing in mind the very particular nature of the west coast of Scotland, with its very long estuaries and isolated peninsular communities, the Commission is presently examining whether it may be possible to regard some mainland to mainland services, such as Gourock/Dunoon and Tarbert/Portavadie for example, as being in the same situation as regular services with (or between) islands, due to the overland alternative either not being a realistic option or being prohibitively long.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 25 July 2000, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia adopted a new law on higher education which will permit the creation of private universities recognised by the Macedonian State.

This new policy, largely brought about by the Prime Minister, Mr Georgevski, and the President of the Democratic Party of Albanians in Macedonia, Mr Xhaferi, and by the OSCE Special Envoy, Mr Van der Stoel, will also make it possible to reintegrate into a normal course of education around 7000 Albanian students in Macedonia who have been studying at the unofficial University of Tetovo and who would otherwise have no prospects for the future and would become an easy prey for populists and supporters of a violent solution to the question of community relations in Macedonia.</p>

<p>I refer to the difficulties experienced by the Liaison Committee of Development NGOs to the European Union in securing its normal annual contract with the European Commission. The audit carried out by the Common Services for External Relations (SCR) revealed that the Liaison Committee is a well-managed organisation, but it also made a lot of recommendations of a political nature. The result is the late and only partial approval of the Liaison Committee’s annual budget, with 20% of the budget still frozen pending an agreement on some of the recommendations set out in the audit. Is it normal to apply such a procedure to a current budget and not simply to future years? Is it the intention of the Commission to destabilise this European framework of 900 NGOs, with serious consequences for good relations with civil society, including the creation of an image of bad EC management? The EC is preparing a communication entitled ‘The Commission and Non-Governmental Organisations: building a stronger partnership’. Does this action not in the meantime threaten to destroy a partnership with development NGOs which has worked well for more than 20 years?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has supported the work of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Liaison Committee for over two decades; it was indeed instrumental in its creation. This unique partnership has developed and matured over the course of time and has provided a special contribution to the development and empowerment through local NGOs of poor communities in developing countries, as well as raising awareness of development issues within Europe. The Commission wants to encourage and develop this excellent working relationship.</p>
<p>Having said this, it is entirely normal, and in complete conformity with sound financial management practice espoused both by the budgetary authority, the Court of Auditors and the Commission’s own internal audit practices, that audits are undertaken of organisations, such as the NGO Liaison Committee (CLONG), which receive grant funding from the Community budget. The audit of CLONG was decided following the review of expenditures covering the grant for the financial year 1999.</p>
<p>The ‘risk assessment’ audit undertaken in early 2000 has in general terms given a positive opinion on the initiatives taken by CLONG to improve its financial management, but has raised nevertheless a range of issues that must be resolved before further finance can be authorised. A full audit by auditors contracted by the Commission will be undertaken in the next few weeks in order to provide an assurance as to the eligibility of expenditure claimed, and clarify what sort of expenses can be justified in the case of future requests submitted by the CLONG.</p>
<p>In early July 2000 an initial contract of EUR 1,434,800 was approved. An additional contract for this year will be considered once the Commission and the CLONG have reached conclusions on how to deal with the recommendations made in the initial risk assessment audit. It is hoped to have more information on this exercise by the end of September. The full amount requested by the CLONG could not be approved pending this examination. The procedure applied to CLONG has been exceptional in its flexibility. Normally, any further grants should be made only when the audit procedure and the follow-up of the results have been completed. Indeed, the Commission would be very happy to find a modus operandi which would ensure that in the future any requests submitted by the CLONG are complete and enable contracts to be approved within normal time periods. But this would mean that information required by the Commission was provided in a timely fashion.<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span></p>
<p>Finally, as regards the comment about ‘destabilising this European framework’ and ‘creating a bad image of EC management’: the Commission has no desire to jeopardise the relationship with the CLONG. The relationship has to advance and evolve. One particularly important issue for example is the present dependence of the CLONG on Commission funding. Twenty six years after its creation, the CLONG still receives 85% funding from the Commission. This situation is as unhealthy for the CLONG as it is for the Commission. Solutions have to be found that will diversify the CLONG’s funding base. This view is shared by the CLONG, and the NGO sector must show courage to overcome this difficulty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
