<p class="contents">Against this background, the European Union plays a crucial role in funding areas of social investment that are difficult for Member States to support at a time when their finances are under extreme pressure as a result of the financial crisis that is having such tremendous effect on us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, instruments such as the European Social Fund, European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and Progress Programme – to mention but a few – provide support for millions of European citizens, promoting self-entrepreneurship and job mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EFG) is a relatively new fund, which was established principally to provide support to workers made redundant as a result of changes in world trade patterns by cofinancing active labour market policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the rapid escalation of the economic and financial crisis in 2008, the European Commission proposed a temporary derogation to the EGF, which was due to finish at the end of this year, in order to extend its scope and be able to offer support to workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic crisis as well as increasing the EGF cofinancing rate from 50% to 65% for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal experience as standing rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the EGF has allowed me to see that adopting this amendment has allowed a more extensive use of the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in the 28 months of life of the EGF before this derogation was introduced, only – just think – 15 applications for funding were presented involving ‘only’ 18 000 redundant workers. However, since the derogation was approved this number has quadrupled.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have also indicated that without the temporary derogation it would be impossible to support 45 000 workers made redundant by companies as a result of the economic and financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with the increase in the cofinancing rate to 65%, the cost of funding to Member States has enabled them to provide immediate support for their workers and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission’s economic forecasts show that no substantial recovery in labour market conditions in Europe is expected before 2013. These assessments, together with the strain being put on Member State budgets by fiscal consolidation efforts, must therefore lead us to conclude that it is necessary to extend the current expiry date before the end of this month, which will be active from 1 January 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the debate on this proposal in the Council on 2 December resulted in several delegations – Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, United Kingdom, Latvia, Czech Republic and Slovakia – opposing this proposal by the Commission, blocking the extension of this derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to sum up, Madam President, by saying that this action on the part of the Council is nothing short of irresponsible. Public opinion sees the fund as an important instrument of solidarity providing financial support to our citizens and redundant workers. We cannot allow the Council to block a further extension, and therefore I hope that all of my fellow members will decide to symbolically support the report that will help the 3 500 workers made redundant by Renault at today’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a new creation, but it was set up before the impact of the financial crisis on the labour markets of Europe became clear. It became operational by 2007 but, at the end of 2008 (as was mentioned by the rapporteur), we changed the original substance of the fund, as a response to the redundancies among workers due to trade liberalisation and the impact of the globalisation of trade, and also to cover workers made redundant as a result of the financial crisis – and rightly so. This was part of a real anti-crisis response on behalf of the European institutions, increasing the cofinancing rate on our side and extending the application of the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a key component of our anti-crisis response and also a political message of European solidarity. So far we have received 53 applications under the extended Globalisation Fund application, targeting more than 50 000 workers. But the crisis derogation was, by its nature, a temporary one and – as rightly explained by the rapporteur, Ms Matera – it will expire at the end of the month. As the crisis is not over, the Commission wanted to extend the mandate to extend these derogations until the end of the present financial perspective – that is, until the end of 2013 – and, with the great responsibility here in this room, Parliament adopted this proposal of extended derogation in September without any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, on the other hand, has failed to extend the derogation, despite – I have to say, although it is not my role to praise the Polish Presidency – the efforts of the Polish Presidency. In practical terms this means the end of the derogation by the end of the year, although that is not the end of the crisis. All the data indicates that the unemployment rate in Europe over the next two years will be not less than 10%. By blocking this proposal, a minority of Member States – with the clear majority in favour of extending the crisis derogation – are putting an end to it. This means that the cofinancing rate will come down to 50% and the scope of the Globalisation Fund will be limited to redundancies caused by trade globalisation. We already have in the pipeline ten new applications for the crisis derogation, affecting many thousands of people in Europe. I am afraid that they may not be able to benefit from the scheme if it is not presented fully by the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that I disagree with some of the arguments used on this occasion by the Member States creating a blocking minority in the Council. The major one was that the problems of unemployment are better targeted at local level. There is a clear misunderstanding here, as the European Globalisation Fund is run by shared management, and the response must be designed locally by the Member States and not in Brussels. So this is a misunderstanding and not a real argument for ending the crisis derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other arguments, which I think are not quite in touch with reality, for example that if we support redundant workers, this will relieve the Member States of a sense of responsibility. But it is cofinancing, and if we see clearly in the statistics that the rich states are better utilising the Globalisation Fund, that means a real problem of cofinancing and sharing responsibility – also financial responsibility – on the part of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say – because this is a clear support of the Globalisation Fund – that so far more than 40% of the workers made redundant due to the crisis but covered by the Globalisation Fund have been able to find another job, so this is working. This is simply working to enhance the labour markets of Europe. But, in practical terms, we have no more crisis derogation in 2012, and I think this is a wrong political message to send to the labour markets: but what can we do? We can only encourage applications under the original trade globalisation criteria, and this is what the Commission can do under the present circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one further, short comment, as this is a joint debate on the specific Renault case. We are taking into consideration the issue, raised by several honourable Members of the European Parliament, of the ex-Renault workers who left the company to join the early retirement scheme and were subsequently negatively affected by the reform of the French pension system. Of course we take their fate into account and are in touch with Renault in order to address the issue. The Renault company has committed itself to taking the necessary measures to ensure that those concerned will not be disregarded and to keep the Commission informed of their actions, but legally the issue has nothing to do with the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Fund. This is a human issue but is not legally an issue of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Fund, as the workers leaving for the early retirement scheme were not targeted for Globalisation Fund support.</p>
<p class="contents">France still has four months to prepare and submit a complete report on the implementation of its measures to handle the fate of the workers. The Commission, for our part, reserves the right to carry out an audit to check that the Globalisation Fund application – and this is in the scope of our responsibility – was properly spent. So here is the role of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">From the legal point of view, the question is whether the requirements for the Globalisation Fund are fulfilled by the Renault application. Ms Matera is saying yes, I know, but this is the legal case. The Commission shares the review with the Council. Renault has made more than 500 workers (this is one of the criteria) redundant as a direct consequence of the global financial crisis. Our contribution (within the nature of the Globalisation Fund) is to be used to co-finance active labour market policy measures. So the only reasonable conclusion today is that the Globalisation Fund should be mobilised and should contribute in full the amount requested by France. Thank you for listening to both the specific points on derogation and the specific Renault case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also share your view, Commissioner, on the disastrous impact it will have on the EU’s image if this measure is stopped despite its proven effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to return briefly to the Renault case – and I also speak on my behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, who is unable to be here today for personal reasons – in order to say that I also share your assessment of this issue. This case has had its ups and downs, no doubt due to the fact that two aspects have been mixed up: the question of which measures are eligible under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and the strictly French issue of voluntary early retirement. As you said, there has been a kind of overlapping between the initial agreement and pension reform in France, which extended the period during which workers have to contribute, leaving a number of workers – the number of these varies, as does the time frame – concerned about their future.</p>
<p class="contents">We share that concern, and it so happens that both Mr Riquet and I are deputies for the constituencies where the affected Renault factories are located. I can assure you that we have spared no effort in trying to encourage Renault to see reason. Just yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the head of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health, who read Renault’s commitments to me. I believe they are serious about those commitments, but I can guarantee that, at local level, we will make every effort to make sure that the workers affected by this pensions problem – which you said is not directly part of this issue – can see a proper solution to their situation. On the basis of these observations I would call on all my colleagues to grant this assistance to Renault.</p>

The issue of pensions has in fact arisen in other French companies and has been resolved, notably at Michelin, for example, which does not come across as an allegedly left-leaning company. What is shocking – and I want to make this clear here and now – is that Renault, 17% of the capital of which is held by the government, has expressed some reservations. However, yesterday I wanted to make sure that these commitments had been made.</p>
<p class="contents">These commitments – which were read out to me over the telephone, but which I did not get in writing – aim to ensure that people who do not receive an income because of an increase in the necessary contribution periods as a result of pension reform in France can have their contribution shortfalls compensated for, in particular through offers of temporary work. However, on humane grounds, this solution does not seem to me to be very satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I said that, at local level – because I am in contact with the prefect of the region, and I am fully prepared to work with Ms Grelier to resolve this issue – I believe that, despite our political differences, we both have the same concern that workers who lose their jobs, who entered into an agreement contractually concluded when the situation was different, do not have their rights eroded because of subsequent changes to the legislation.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards the review aimed at extending the ‘crisis’ criterion, the fact that some Member States decided to block it in Council is surprising, striking, indicative of a lack of solidarity, and worrying, when we consider that the review of the post-2013 fund is on the table.

I cannot say I am shocked, because this is not the first time we have heard such a message from the Council. Are they saying to us that the crisis is over, when the crisis is raging? Refusing to accept that and deal adequately with it is just plain unreasonable. It is also dangerous – but that is another story. Or are they really saying to us that they are giving up on social solidarity and that workers and countries are on their own?</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand that some Member States do not support the Globalisation Fund; they believe it is not a suitable instrument. However, four different compromises were presented and none were successful, so I believe some Member States have simply set their face against this fund, which offers European added value to redundant workers who have lost their jobs because of the financial crisis. They want to cut the fund, to minimise it. Yet the number of applications under the crisis derogation continues to rise and, significantly, more and more countries are accessing the fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the fund is up and running, the brakes are being applied. We can improve the functioning of the fund – and hopefully we in Parliament will help to do that over the next few months – but the Council ignored the Commission and the strong views of Parliament, which adopted the Commission’s proposal without amendment. We have been sidelined, and what is incredible is that some of the countries in the blocking minority successfully accessed the EGF for their own citizens who were made redundant due to the crisis, but are now saying to other European citizens that they do not think they should access the fund under the same conditions as their citizens, and that they are going to make it more difficult for them to do this. As I said, I am not shocked, but I am genuinely saddened at the absence of solidarity – it is not a good omen.</p>

I am going to address the future of the fund after 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all eagerly been looking forward to the Commission’s proposals aimed at improving the fund. There is plenty still to do if we are to really turn that Rapid Intervention Fund into what we envisioned, and we must also do something about the fact that it is being used mostly by richer, rather than poorer, Member States. However, the issue which has been totally overlooked is that of farming. I therefore read the proposal with total bewilderment.</p>
<p class="contents">What surprises me the most is that you actually want to divide this into two totally different instruments. A small social instrument for workers who have been made redundant and a larger instrument of EUR 2.5 billion for farmers. I believe you ought to make a choice: they should either be considered the same or different. If they are considered the same, farmers could then fall under the EGF, under the same rules. That, to my mind, would be a great solution. Or they could be treated equally, by making companies hit by crisis and globalisation subject to the same rules that you have now proposed for farmers. Should they come under threat because of EU policy or a free trade agreement, they will be able to restructure their company before it goes bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">The Flemish textile industry and the Spanish ceramics industry greatly benefited from that, after free trade with Asia forced their products off the market. However, in that case, you will be talking about a totally different instrument, one that will be an industrial instrument, which means you could throw in a few billion more.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Commission wants to achieve something completely different with agriculture. So, take that decision and come up with an instrument that suits <span class="italic">them</span>, and one on which we can have an agriculture-related debate. Send Directorate-General Agriculture back to the drawing board, to its own drawing board, so they can thrash the debate out there, and do not allow the problems of one group, farmers, to be prioritised at the expense of the other group, workers who have been made redundant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those least able to make use of the EGF.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the requirement of 35% national finance for projects supporting the unemployed submitted for EGF funding was already making it difficult for some Member States to apply, especially those in receipt of a so-called bailout package. However, obliging that provision of this funding be limited to a few cases where multinationals relocate leaves the majority of cases submitted and still not considered out in the cold. This situation alone demonstrates the European Union’s lack of solidarity. If, however, we add to all this other clauses from the EGF Regulation that lead to great disparities in aid because they are based on a calculation founded on wages paid in the Member State turning to its funding to support its unemployed workers, we can conclude that the EGF is useful, above all, for the countries that are more developed and have better economic and social conditions, like Germany, the Netherlands and others, which continue to block the extension of the EGF derogation. That is why we are protesting against this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Renault issue, I should also like to express my solidarity with the around 5 000 workers who have been victims of redundancy, but we regret the confused situation that France has created surrounding this EGF application process, and the company’s lack of dialogue with the representatives of its workers. Nonetheless, we maintain our position of solidarity with the workers and our support for mobilising the EGF, despite the criticisms that we also continue to make of the EGF Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is striking that the EGF’s total contribution to all the applications approved since that time – 2007 – is only EUR 370 million. In view of the crisis that has been devastating us since 2008, with the resultant increase in unemployment, we have to improve implementation of the EGF. This situation is explained, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, by the complexity of the EGF and by the fact that Europe’s contribution is only 65%, constituting an obstacle to the Member States in the greatest financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to retaining the derogation already mentioned here in plenary, I also propose approving an increase in European cofinancing for the EGF to 95% for Member States in receipt of a bailout package, similar to that recently approved by Parliament in relation to funding from cohesion policy and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report under discussion, concerning the more than 4 400 redundant French workers, I say only that the EGF cannot, at any time, be used as a political weapon, influenced by electoral timetables, since that – as is obvious – always primarily harms the interests of workers. I therefore hope this report will be adopted here today, during this sitting.</p>

With regard to the European Regional Development Fund, to cohesion policy funding and to the European Social Fund, there were many people who were against a 10% increase in cohesion policy funding, whose opinions have developed and changed. As regards the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), there were many people who did not agree with the increase in relation to cofinancing who have also changed their minds.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal is not for all Member States, but for the Member States in receipt of a bailout package. I do not know if this proposal in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was generalised or was only for those Member States. Therefore, what I am advocating, and I was clear – and I hope this House will be able to back this one of these days, because it is almost a question of logic – that what has happened with cohesion policy, what has happened with the EAFRD, should, logically, even <span class="italic">a fortiori</span>, also be approved for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund does not compete with the European Social Fund but rather complements it, so I believe it makes perfect sense for the contribution to go from 65% to 95% for countries in receipt of a bailout package.</p>

It is good to see you in this last week of business in Strasbourg for this year. As Mr Fernandes has rightly said, 2007 was the year the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established, since which – it is unfortunate that my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is no longer listening – EUR 307 million has been distributed – out of a fund of EUR 2.5 billion. Money alone is not the solution when it comes to tackling economic crises and the consequences of globalisation. Structural reforms in the labour market, economic reforms, taxation reforms and social reforms are the elements that can be used to take control of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not be fooled into thinking that money is the horn of plenty that can be used to solve all problems in the long term. If we see the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as a way to reward the conduct of companies like Nokia, which has moved from Bochum in Germany to Romania and, ultimately, out of the European Union, receiving monetary support on two occasions, that is the wrong approach, and we will certainly not allow that to happen. Mr Fernandes is quite right and I share his views on the prospect of the European Parliament becoming the field where national election campaigns are fought.</p>
<p class="contents">I note what has happened in France. I also believe, however, that this is a matter for France and does not need to be discussed here. That is why my group will reject the oral amendment if tabled. There are still more than 40 Members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in this House. This means that we can also reject this oral amendment. I would much prefer it if we were to sit down together and work out how we can integrate the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund intelligently into European budgetary policy within the parameters of the Multiannual Financial Framework, ensuring more growth and more jobs, rather than perpetuating unemployment with the money we have.</p>

This instrument has a positive role but, first of all, the procedures are too long to provide effective protection for workers who need support quickly so that they are not left to their own devices. Secondly, the brief history of this EGF has already been plagued by very controversial cases of payments from public authorities which served only to repair the damage caused by companies savagely outsourcing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union would do better than to beat its head against a brick wall. It needs, first of all, to think about how it authorises free trade which is both lawless and unscrupulous. When will social and environmental criteria be integrated in our commercial agreements to combat dumping? The famous EGF must be a tool supporting the immediate transition to high quality ‘green’ jobs, hence local jobs that cannot be outsourced.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Renault, the EGF does not authorise the cofinancing of passive measures. What is the current situation in the case of Renault? Neither the Renault Group, nor the French Government, nor the European Commission has been able to convince us that the training measures offered to workers at the time were active measures. What does that mean? It means real training programmes aimed at making people employable. That is the first thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that the case, in particular, of all the workers threatened with insecurity because they joined the early retirement scheme is not a specifically French issue – as has been said – but a question of European solidarity. All workers must be treated in the same way: some have nothing to gain from measures, while others do.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear my colleague, Mr Gauzès, for whom I have very high regard, tell us today, in this Chamber, that Renault has committed itself to take concrete measures. I am a little sad to hear this only today. I think he should have woken up long ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Renault is a clear textbook case, an example of what not to do. We are quite divided in my group and so I am going to speak on behalf of the French delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">Renault is an economically sound company. Every year, it makes billions in profits; three billion in 2009 alone. Renault is making what we call stock market redundancies. Each year, for several years now, thousands of workers have been laid off simply for the benefit of shareholders, including the French Government. It is not about the electoral calendar. This has happened again and again at Renault for several years now. As for me, my votes have not changed in this regard. I fail to see what benefit this has for the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the ongoing debate on the fund will enable a thorough review of how it works to be carried out to avoid supporting the worst practices of major companies with regard to their workers, who are treated, in this case, like simple adjustment variables. We know that, in France, social support plans leave much to be desired, to say the least, and that the objective of social integration is not on the table, especially as regards Renault. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One debate relates to the issue of the extension of the derogation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for companies affected by the crisis. Of course, I too regret that a blocking minority in the Council – which we also had for the European food aid programme for the most deprived – is able to oppose the continuation of this fund. At the same time, we are having this debate on Renault.</p>
<p class="contents">These two debates are linked. We cannot, on the one hand, want the fund to be extended and, on the other hand, call into question the EUR 24.5 million that would be allocated to Renault. I understand that there are difficulties, that 180 workers are affected, in particular, by problems of application associated with pension reform. However, we must not mix everything up. Above all, we must not allow the European Parliament to become hostage to national matters. Nor can we allow the European Parliament to be held hostage for electoral purposes. We are in a Parliament where the political divide – thank God – can, very often, be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we need, together, to vote for this mobilisation to enable not only companies but also workers to procure the best conditions for their redeployment. Faced with this serious crisis in Europe, we need to be responsible, we need to be courageous and we must defend the general interest, and only the general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is something of a paradox that some Member States – whose representative and member of the Council is not present to hear this debate and our arguments – refuse to extend the derogation within the framework of the crisis mechanism at a time when the OECD notes that the European Union and, in particular, the euro area is in recession, and has corrected the growth forecasts for next year to 0.2%. Where is the end of the crisis? I put the question to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that there is a blocking minority in the Council which thinks that, since we are in a crisis, it is no longer necessary to apply the fundamental rule of the European Union, which is that of solidarity. I call on the Council to hear Parliament’s message. We demand solidarity within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like just one second to talk about Renault. There are some in this Chamber who say that this is all about electoral manoeuvring. I call on the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to ensure that its right hand knows what its left hand is doing. I ask that, tomorrow, when it looks at how pension reform has been implemented in France, it takes into account the damage caused by Mr Bertrand and his pension reform and that it tells France that the disastrous effects of this pension reform must be corrected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will make it significantly harder for laid-off workers to access the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. It adds insult to the injury of the already-existing inadequacies of that fund. Workers in Ireland have suffered from mismanagement and bureaucratic delay even as regards how the fund has been administered, with the result that a significant amount of the money allocated for Dell workers is due to be returned.</p>
<p class="contents">Any assistance for workers faced with the tragedy of unemployment is to be welcomed. However, the fund has simply proved to be a tiny sticking plaster on the massive gaping wound of unemployment created by capitalism across Europe. Instead of making it harder for workers to access the fund, it should be made easier, and workers should be put at the very heart of the administration of the fund. More fundamentally, if the EU and national governments are serious about tackling unemployment, they should introduce measures, including nationalisation, to stop multinational corporations from relocating and engaging in a race to the bottom in terms of workers’ wages and conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because, unlike other groups, Renault refused to take account of the situation of former, older, workers laid off in 2009 and soon left with nothing following the entry into force of the reform of the pension system. Because, with profits of more than EUR 3 billion in 2010, the Renault Group exploits the full potentialities of globalisation. Because I think that, at a time when everyone is being urged to tighten their belts, signing a blank cheque for EUR 24.5 million with no <span class="italic">quid pro quo</span> is outrageous. Because, finally, Commissioner, the training and support measures presented by the applicants as active back-to-work measures, the only ones eligible for funding under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) are, in fact, disconnected from any resumption-of-activity logic.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about salving our consciences by creating the illusion that we are supporting European industry. In the end, what counts is that we support the interests of the workers in the industry and the associated jobs.

I think it does, if you like, build on other concerns which I have about how Europe is currently operating, the mindset of the Council and the impact of that on the wider European solidarity that others have spoken about.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in crisis, and it seems very wise that we should extend this mechanism and also improve the way it functions so that the money flows to assist those who are forced out of work to gain employment. But I see a trend emerging here in the Council; we have also had a block on the Aid for the Needy Programme, which will have its life cut short.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned, Commissioner – as you will be – about how this will impact on the negotiations for the budget after 2013. I do not envy you in your task or us in ours in trying to have a sustainable budget. But could I address a part of that future? I see in the common agricultural policy reforms that there is a proposal that this fund will be extended to farmers. I rather see this as a blanket, a comfort blanket, which will not exist if we are in the current mindset and will do little to address some of the very damaging aspects of trade negotiations on agriculture, which are also damaging for food security.

While EU leaders rush around the continent trying to prevent financial catastrophe on a global scale, these ministers seem to think the crisis is not impacting on jobs – when unemployment levels reach record highs across the eurozone, being over 14% in Ireland. Unbelievably, the signal the ministers are sending is that these unprecedented rates are not caused by the economic crisis. Ironically, this unfortunate decision was made on the same day the Commission announced an extension of a derogation granting Member States a licence to spend fortunes more bailing out the banks. To add insult to injury, the special arrangement for banks will start the day after the end of this meagre but important EGF provision to support people on the dole because of a crisis triggered by market speculators and reckless bankers.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence, I must now call on the Commission to prepare and put in place, as soon as possible, a new European crisis fund or a real economy fund in order to assist the many workers made redundant by the toxic fallout of our hyper-financialised economy, which has swept the EU into the woes we see today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important sign of the European Parliament’s solidarity, union and cohesion, because I am convinced – as I am sure you must also be absolutely convinced – that Parliament cannot and must not be a dumping-ground for all the inaccuracies, choices and reforms that take place inside Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I trust in my fellow Members’ sense of responsibility I do not and cannot believe that some would abstain or vote against the Renault case just because they want and have to follow the election manifesto of their own Member State. I do not believe it, and I am sure that they will show their sense of responsibility, enabling us to inject new life and credibility into this fund, which would be seriously undermined should the honourable Members not vote together in favour of the payment of these funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have three short remarks: the first on the crisis derogation. Fortunately the misunderstanding was clarified. Yes, the Commission wanted an extension until the end of 2013, but this was voted down by a blocking minority, including some states which benefited from the scheme. There were good reasons for extending the scheme due to the developments in the labour market, with a sudden recent acceleration of applications – two thirds of all the applications came in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">I can agree with Ms Ţicǎu that countries in Eastern Europe undergoing the so-called transformation from the old system to the new system know how painful this might be without globalisation, as our countries can neither be termed developed or under-developed parts of the world; this was rather a mis-developed part of the world, with a lot of industrial stock on the ground but completely useless in terms of a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns Renault. Thank you, Mr Gauzès, for explaining the action from the local point of view. I can only say that I know a special unit has been set up by Renault to deal with the issue. Our prerogative is to monitor and contact, but I can assure all of you that, from the legal point of view, this case fulfilled all the criteria of the European Globalisation Fund application. What matters is the future: as the Globalisation Fund is on the table in the proposal for 2014-2020, this means that we fully understand the added value of the fund in terms of making the reactions of the Member States more durable and of improved quality in terms of active labour market policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear from the mid-term review is that exactly 42% of the workers covered by the scheme under this crisis derogation were able very quickly to find places on the job market. So this is working and is probably very conducive to the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree fully with those who ask for a much quicker response by the Globalisation Fund. This is as slow as the Solidarity Fund, which is also part of the proposal. What was very controversial – and here the remarks of Mr Daerden and Ms Cornelissen are relevant – is whether to extend it to farming. This was done in a very clear context, and the context, as I can reveal, was going into the Mercosur trade liberalisation talks with insecurity in the rural areas around the impact of trade liberalisation on the farming community. For my colleagues, and especially the one responsible for this major deal on trade liberalisation, this was a kind of insurance cover for entering into the trade liberalisation agreements with countries with more competitive pricing for agricultural products. This was the context of the decision to risk the extension of the Globalisation Fund to farming. But this is not at the cost of industrial workers, because we have our estimates in the pipeline, and I think the numbers proposed could be adequate as insurance for both areas: industry and farming.</p>
<p class="contents">But I can agree with Mr Alvaro and the others that this is <span class="italic">keine Wunderwaffe</span>: this is one of the tools in the toolbox for dealing with a crisis: valuable, therefore extended and should be defended, because this is also a tangible and visible sign in several corners of the European Union that the European institutions are useful, credible and could help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This European fund for the affected workers is essential in helping to cushion the blow of the global economic and financial crisis to at least some extent. It is also an important sign that the EU is there for people in Europe, helping them to find new employment. There is no way to justify the opening up of this fund to the agricultural sector, which is already the most funded sector in the EU, receiving up to 83% support. Industrial workers need support now more than ever. Two thirds of all requests for support from the EGF were submitted in 2010 and 2011, leading one to conclude that this is a growing trend and that employees recognise that there is something there to help them. The figures show that the fund is needed by industrial workers. I would argue that the resources of the EGF should be restricted exclusively to workers in the industrial sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

The promotion of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources is of crucial importance to economic growth and job creation in Europe. The European Union has been developing strategies and ambitious legislation on this issue. However, all policies require instruments that are robust and that make the connection with the regional and local levels. This programme and the agency for implementing it have been contributing considerably to the implementation of legislation relating to renewable energy and energy efficiency, specifically by supporting innovative projects. In particular, activities like the Covenant of Mayors and the Pact of Islands should be continued and stepped up. It is particularly at times of crisis that programmes like this are crucial for competitiveness and economic recovery. In this context, I should like to ask the Commission the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what does the Commission intend to do to guarantee the IEE programme a leading role in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how does the Commission intend to improve the successor to this programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is the institutional framework for the successor to this IEE programme within the Horizon 2020 programme and what level of funding will be assigned to it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme and the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation are outstanding examples of this in the field of combating climate change, so the Commission will understand the concern of Members of this House when we learn of plans to discontinue a programme which encourages citizens to use energy more wisely and to help the Union to meet its Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has talked about continuing work in this area, about mainstreaming it, about strengthening it in future funding programmes. Commissioner Oettinger was suggesting yesterday that Intelligent Energy Europe might go into the Horizon 2020, but we want to know whether there will be a dedicated programme still. We want to know whether this will have the visibility that the IEE programme has had. We want to know whether it will activate civil society and foster commitment in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">As Ms Carvalho said, the European Local Energy Assistance Facility has leveraged huge amounts of money from a very small investment to help businesses become energy efficient, to retrofit social housing, to improve public transport, to design smart energy buildings and to connect renewable energy production into electricity grids. If that programme were to disappear it would be a real loss to a huge variety of decentralised activities to promote renewable energy and energy saving.</p>
<p class="contents">I think at heart the question that Members are asking is this: has the Commission lost its way when it comes to renewable energy? Why is it planning to pump money into gas distribution networks for the benefit of companies that are already making billions in profits, rather than pumping money into the vision that it still professes of a renewable energy Europe, one where we can meet our commitment of cutting carbon by 80% by 2050? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not with you personally, but with the people in the Directorates-General for Research and Innovation and for Energy, who are in the process of doing away with one of the most sensible programmes we ever had within the European budget, namely the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme. Studies in relation to offshore wind energy in the North Sea, training workshops for government civil servants on the implementation of the EU’s Buildings Directive, training courses for architects and engineers on how to build near-zero energy buildings, networks between progressive mayors in Europe – the list goes on and on. Why is all this to be destroyed? Why?</p>
<p class="contents">If Ms Geoghegan-Quinn and Mr Oettinger fail to come up with a concrete project, then we, as parliamentarians, will be forced to resurrect the old Competition and Innovation Programme (CIP) and to restore the Horizon 2020 programme to what it should be: a separate research programme and a well-organised innovation programme. Those colleagues here present will be aware of the importance we attach to this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect a swift and specific response in writing both from Ms Geoghegan-Quinn and from Mr Oettinger. The abolition of the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme is poison in a time in which we must garner support for Europe among its citizens. We are turning our backs on those people in Europe who are in favour of European policy. This is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, in order for the results of the research to be capable of contributing to our energy policy objectives regarding efficiency and renewable energy, they need to be accompanied by two types of measures that are also very important: first, measures supporting actions aimed at promoting market penetration of the resulting energy technologies and secondly, measures to eliminate non-technological barriers, which could be confused with market failures, by boosting capacitation, training and awareness-raising activities and mobilising both local investment and the parties involved, as in the case of the Pact of Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme has met these objectives with remarkable success, as has been demonstrated by the various evaluations that have been carried out and the programme has, moreover, been distinguished by its support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, I wish to make my group’s support clear, here and now, for the continuity of the programme’s objectives and our commitment to providing it with clear and solid funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a huge step forward in terms of reducing the causes of climate change, limiting and minimising pollution and achieving more efficient and rational energy use. However, when talking about truly intelligent energy, we should today discuss other principles, such as non-fossil-fuel-based energy in Europe. The options might include wind, solar and hydro energy. The search for new forms of energy should be the goal at which all programmes consolidating intelligent energy in Europe should be directed.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States’ investment in new and leading-edge technologies in the field of energy efficiency and in renewable energy sources should be promoted and funded. New and bold steps should in principle be taken today in order to ensure intelligent energy use. Let us plan for a future of new forms of energy, such as hydrogen power and new generations of nuclear technology. We are the generation on whose action it depends whether we will safeguard the earth for future generations or will condemn it to a slow but inevitable death in 100 or 200 years’ time. Let us choose those actions and let us follow those principles which do not provide the slightest incentive to destroy what we did not create in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, all the questions asked and comments made expressed deep concern over the future of a programme which made a great contribution to energy efficiency and renewable energy across Europe. Therefore I can assure you that the commitment remains and should be reinforced – also in financial terms – in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As many arguments concerning the use and contribution and value added of the Intelligent Energy Europe II programme had already been presented, I do not need to repeat them. But what I have to say is that this not just a subjective feeling. It is also reinforced and fully confirmed by the external evaluation of the programme. I can state with satisfaction that this is both relevant and useful, as it replies to the evolving needs, problems and periods relating to sustainable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme was, as you know, supporting more than 500 projects, 50% of which went to small and medium-size enterprises, and this was a clear preoccupation of Mr Paksas.</p>
<p class="contents">Two success stories should be in the textbooks highlighting the utility of that kind of common European programme: Solar Keymark and the ELENA facility. These are two clear success stories.</p>
<p class="contents">But the major questions were not about the past and present but about the future. My answer is that we have to handle several targets: energy efficiency and renewable energy sources is one of them – a very serious one. However, at the same time we have to respond to the question of energy security and solidarity. This is the question that was so tangible in 2009, when there were cuts in the gas supply via Ukraine – tangible in the kitchens of some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So we also have to respond to these concerns. This is why we have to share out money in order to reinforce energy efficiency: renewable, yes, but also transborder networks that are really contributing to energy security and solidarity on the continent, which is so dependent on deliveries from third countries which from time to time clearly display their monopoly power.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the future, as I was informed – you well know that this is not quite my dossier, but I was studying it before coming to the House – my preoccupation is to achieve better coherence between research, innovation and market update. This is why the Commission placed the programme-related activities as a dedicated energy component of a new framework programme. This is the philosophy of mainstreaming actions, and we have been asked by many sources to mainstream our actions in this respect. This is called Horizon 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree – and this is really what I have started as somebody responsible for the budget – that the clearly small amount of money (and I agree, this was a small amount of money: EUR 743 million) via leverage was giving a clear impact. Therefore, this is about clear impact with little money.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that energy efficiency and energy-renewable sources activities should be reinforced with more resources within the non-growing budget. Implementation and details are coming in 2012. I know, already in advance, that it should be reinforced, and this is one of the very few chapters or parts of the 2014-2020 budget proposal to grow. The others are either nominally frozen or generally defended as a real constant.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the real proposal for the future: to defend the budget as a real constant and really nominally frozen major spending blocks – cohesion and agricultural policy. This is the essence of a programme called Horizon 2020 adopted on 30 November with details to be known at a later stage. Perhaps we should go into a detailed discussion on the basis of these implementing details.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, also the place for the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation. Here again, the external evaluation clearly indicates that this is a useful body. Therefore, the role of this agency in all these related activities should be reinforced. We have an external evaluation (so this is not just our feeling) of both the Intelligent Energy Europe II programme and the Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation, so both would be better placed, in financial terms, in the 2014-2020 programme. Here is my budgetary story. So I can say that this is not just a slogan but a clear indication that in real (also in financial) terms, we fully share the assessment of Parliament as to the value added of these programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want to achieve energy independence, we must be resolute in choosing to set up all our projects on renewable energy and energy efficiency by 2050. There are no objectives which are more important than those two.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we should, therefore, ensure that we are able to make major investments, and the Commission must bear that responsibility; it then follows that we need programmes like the Intelligent Energy Europe programme. Why is that? So that we can ensure that really major initiatives can be taken at a local level and, indeed, at a lower cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner keeps referring to ‘the low hanging fruit of energy efficiency’, because we need those budgets for that. Those budgets must be clearly defined and allocated specifically to this programme. That is what we would actually like to hear from you today: that those budgets are in place and that they have been ringfenced for those objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the poet, who was also an effective ruler, would no doubt qualify these statements by calling for saving and efficiency. For, in a Europe poor in energy resources, it is essential that we can distinguish between necessary consumption that drives the economy and superfluous consumption. We need to control the latter and, to that end, it is imperative to encourage drastic change in the habits of many European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When we analyse the economic crisis, we call for austerity and also for stimuli for growth. Well, fine, few better spheres in which to turn those beautiful words into reality than the energy sphere, where a combination of saving and the necessary investment for large projects is required, including construction of an integrated infrastructure network, the report on which I had the honour of presenting to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must make more tangible efforts than those made to date because it would put a bit of backbone into Europe. Only a sound, well-thought out, efficient and economical European energy policy will enable Europe to walk upright and in the right direction.

European policy needs to represent an innovation direction that is capable of ensuring a long-term, sustainable energy supply for the European Union. The Russian gas crisis, the Fukushima nuclear catastrophe and the depletion of fossil fuels are forcing us to find an answer to the question of energy for the future as soon as possible. The ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme formulated by the Commission definitely represents such a direction. Its main objective is to ensure clean, secure and sustainable energy for future generations. It supports energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not only able to help small and medium-sized enterprises with this programme, we can encourage innovative solutions, create jobs and support the issue of education and research as well. In spite of all this, unfortunately, the programme did not receive a specific position in the upcoming support system. This is why I would like to ask the Commission to do everything in its power to allow this programme to continue operating. I believe that even in spite of the concerns caused by Fukushima, we can still list atomic energy as a form of intelligent energy. It has been proved that atomic energy is capable of producing unlimited, clean and safe energy that does not involve the production of carbon dioxide. The fusion reactor built as a result of the ITER project can become just such an energy source in the future. Therefore, nuclear energy should be given a stable position in the ‘Intelligent Energy’ programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving access to this programme must be balanced in Member States which are not involved in such projects at the moment, which ought to be actively promoted and encouraged.</p>

So there can be no doubt about the fulfilment of the EU energy strategies, through which the competitiveness of the European Union will soar and soon put emerging countries behind it, and, perhaps later, the rest of the world as well. Naturally all this will be implemented in a completely sustainable way. The poor Chinese will be trembling at the knees when they look towards the unbelievable development in the European Union. Or wait a minute, if I take a better look, they are actually doubled over in laughter, and this is what makes their knees tremble. They do not understand how it is possible to bail water out of a sinking boat with a teaspoon, not even bothering to mend the hole first. Ladies and gentlemen, let us speak seriously for once.</p>
<p class="contents">As an initial step we need to mend the broken backbone of the energy industry immediately, as I have said in my earlier speeches on several occasions. Once our ailing energy industry, especially electricity production, has got back on its feet, we can talk about the details, such as the ‘Intelligent Energy – Europe’ programme. However, it is not worth spending a lot on this either. Unfortunately only 2% of citizens are able to buy so-called green energy at its real price, so perhaps we should think about the other 98% sometimes. Unfortunately, it seems I was talking about atomic power plant construction all in vain; China has already made plans for them 20 years in advance. In other words, if this is how we are going to continue, sooner or later Europe will become an open-air museum where we use candles for lighting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the current economic crisis, this objective is extremely ambitious and difficult to achieve. Therefore we should appreciate that we have an effective tool which can help us in this regard, namely Intelligent Energy for Europe. During the decade it has been in operation, we have seen very clearly that the principles adopted within the framework of this programme, as well as its mechanisms of action, contribute to greater energy efficiency, promote renewable energy sources and, above all, enhance the exchange of experience between scientists and experts in the field. It is well worth our while to ensure that this experience is not wasted. It is important that the new version of the programme is open to new technological and fuel opportunities which have appeared recently and which make it possible for some Member States, in particular those where changes are urgently needed, to bring about a real reduction in CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. An example of a new source of energy of this kind that will improve Europe’s energy independence and which is worthy of attention is the shale gas deposits recently discovered in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the current version of the programme lies in the fact that each project that is funded and implemented can be verified and evaluated in terms of its quantifiable results.

From my experience, I am amazed at the number of businesses, towns and villages who have come to me over the last number of months with projects designed to ensure that they can make energy savings and be more efficient through new schemes. So for that reason it is very important that this scheme would continue, either in its present form or integrated into the multiannual financial framework.</p>

If something works, then it just works and you do not need to approach it from a different angle or start calling it by a different name. In that case, we can just keep it exactly as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intelligent Energy Europe programme did work, as you said, because it had a real impact on citizens and SMEs. Indeed, as previous speakers have already said, getting x much closer to having a true European Union is going to take x amount of time, and that applies when it comes to this issue, as well. Your fellow Commissioner, Oettinger, said that yesterday, too. He said that the programme had definitely already been planned and that he would let us know during the week under which line. However, it seems to me that we have actually been caused a small amount of unnecessary inconvenience. From now on, I would like to know these things in advance and I would like to know precisely what this and that means.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you perhaps tell us exactly under which facility this programme is going to be set up, the exact size of the budget that is going to be allocated to it and precisely what its objectives are going to be? Will it be expanded and how do you intend to measure its effectiveness in future? Above all, are we going to see it re-emerge, for example, under the next Multiannual Financial Framework or the next Horizon programme? Can we not just keep these kinds of programmes as they are?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would just like to add that a great deal of attention has also been devoted to research in the Horizon 2020 programme, as well; that is a good thing. This is the very kind of programme – the kind which is very practical and which benefits SMEs – of which we currently have far too few, so that is an area we need to pay more attention to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another example is the case of the island of Flores, 100% of whose electricity is already hydroelectric at certain times of year.

The programme has available for the 2007-2013 period funding of EUR 730 million and provides 75% of the funding for the winning projects from among the annual project applications.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme has funded so far more than 500 European projects lasting 2-3 years, with 8-9 countries participating in each project. This means more than 3 000 beneficiaries from 31 countries. As regards increasing energy efficiency alone, more than 250 projects have been carried out in sectors such as transport, industry, energy services, energy efficiency in buildings and equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I rate particularly positively the EU for Energy initiative funded by the Intelligent Energy Europe programme, whose aim is to increase Europe’s competitiveness. This year 476 projects have entered for the competition, submitted by 328 schools from every European Union Member State, as well as from Norway and Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">We support, Commissioner, the continuation of the Intelligent Energy Europe programme in the future financial framework as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This usefulness and cost-effectiveness can be seen in a programme with a not-so-big budget of EUR 743 million that still has a huge leverage effect and impact on energy efficiency and renewable energy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the involvement of small and medium-size companies, only part of the 3 000 partners – that is 1 500 partners – can be classified as small and medium-sized companies. The position of Parliament was not only visible as regards the awards; Parliament was able to increase the budget for this programme for 2011 by EUR 10 million and for 2012 by EUR 7.5 million. This is a commitment which is expressed in budgetary lines as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will not disappear. The commitment cannot disappear because this is so conducive to the goals of the 2020 Strategy, and energy efficiency is among the seven priority areas of the Strategy for the Future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to respond to the need for mainstreaming programmes. Mainstreaming is clearly indicated in all the evaluations of various programmes of the European Union. Given the constraints of not being able to spend more money, we need in future to look at better spending. This is about the mainstreaming of programmes, not the disappearance of a programme that is performing so well.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the future of this programme? It will be placed under a consistent framework which links research development and market update within the growing envelope for Horizon 2020 – growing from EUR 50 billion to EUR 80 billion. The energy component is classified as secure, clean and efficient energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot give up on the issue of energy security on the continent, on which we will be so dependent in the coming years. Energy security is an important aspect of Horizon 2020. It is clearly the place for an energy component which is classified as clean and efficient energy; it is the place for intelligent energy and for a dedicated element of this energy component. So it is going to be a very visible commitment, in monetary terms as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course this is not the only place to find money for intelligent, renewable and efficient energy. As you probably know, this is high in the hierarchy of the goals of the structural funds, which attract a much larger amount of money in so-called interim regions, namely the regions with a per capita GDP of less than 90% of the European Union average. There is a very limited range of goals, and energy efficiency is the number one area of the structural funds to which funding is to be committed in this type of region of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are looking at the position of intelligent energy in the multiannual framework. This could be more than EUR 1 billion instead of EUR 700 million, for example; I cannot give exact figures today, but I know that this is a growing envelope. Therefore, visibility and financial commitment is to be guaranteed in the multiannual framework for 2014-2020. The role of the European Parliament is very clear in shaping the future by shaping the rules of the game in this component of the multiannual framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, the European authorities must take account of the differences between national economies and Europe’s regions because it is important that developing energy programmes (including diversification of supply sources) and boosting the production of energy from renewable sources also take into account the requirements of the local environment. Last but not least, the European authorities must bear in mind that, unlike other areas where the cost of investment or procurement which needs to be made is lower, the development of energy programmes requires considerable effort.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, it is of paramount importance to outline an institutional vision for cofinancing which will meet the interests of the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as build a European economy which is not only more efficient and competitive, but also more inclusive. It is just as important for the development of the European Union that the EU executive responds by its actions to the problem of funding the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme. Similarly, the completion of the programme must provide an opportunity for making the most of the results achieved and creating a successor to it, capable of overcoming the problems that the IEE faced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim is to train a group of experts locally who will disseminate information among the general public. The consultancy offered in this framework is targeted at deprived social groups in particular, covering almost 160 000 households.

However, the entities involved need to be involved and active in all the policies. This is why the contribution of the Intelligent Energy Europe programme through the Executive Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) in the realm of energy efficiency is crucial. We need to underline that the Intelligent Energy Europe programme plays a strategically important a role in EU economic recovery and the revival of fundamental issues such as energy security, the environment and health. However, I believe that it is crucial to simplify the rules for access to finance in order to allow greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises and to open up research projects to young researchers. We must not forget our achievements thus far, but we must also face the new challenges created by a global market in which our closest competitors are China and the US. I especially hope that on the next Info Day on 24 January 2012 preference will be given to the participation of researchers in those parts of Europe that are at the bottom of the list when it comes to the awarding of grants, in order to promote the importance of equal opportunities for researchers and coordinators in the various regions of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the results of the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) programme, which about more than just specific successful projects and sharing their results. It is about developing a broader awareness of the importance of the rational conduct of European civilisation. Through support for research and innovation with investments in projects for sustainable energy, despite some partial failures or problems, the actual question of sustainable energy has come onto the agenda. Without energy aware decision-making by public authorities, and without public pressure on such decision-making, it would be quite impossible to achieve the goals we are now discussing in relation to the energy efficiency directive. The Multiannual Financial Framework contains no mention of continuing the IEE programme. Horizon 2020, the framework programme for research and innovation as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020, must therefore take on the role of the IEE, and above all secure sufficient funding for this programme. Without further support and facilitation of decision-making processes respecting energy efficiency, it will not be possible to ensure the internalisation of external costs in the area of transport, or to create a new impulse over intelligent networks. Without economical and innovative thinking, it will not be possible to begin implementing large-scale integrated projects in the field of energy, and without these the European energy sector will not become sustainable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title5"></a><a name="creitem5"></a>

<p class="contents">We have worked hard within a tight schedule to agree the report presented by the Commission this year so that there is a stronger link between the reply from Parliament and the Commission’s proposal. I am extremely grateful to my fellow Members, especially the shadow rapporteurs in the committee, for their commitment in ensuring that this was possible today. The reason for this sometimes somewhat more pressing haste was the fact that we have obviously included a point in paragraph 21 that is contentious on formal grounds. For this reason, I intend requesting that we should postpone the vote, but only the vote, until February, so that we can clarify this point for all our fellow Members in the interests of a tidy report.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the 40<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the Commission’s Annual Report on EU Competition Policy and it is evident that European competition policy, the work of the European Commission in the area of competition law and state aid control is a unique success for the single market and its consumers. That is why I believe that the European Parliament should show more appreciation for this work by the European Commission from time to time, focusing more on the link between the control of dominant market structures, on the one hand, and direct gains for consumers on the other. We managed this very well at the event in Poznań hosted by the Polish Presidency a few weeks ago to mark the anniversary of competition policy and consumer protection, where it was plainly evident that consumer protection and competition policy are two sides of the same coin. Thus, we have three major focuses in the area of competition policy in the European Commission this year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, in this report, which was approved by a very broad majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the European Parliament is seeking even tighter controls on the state aid afforded to banks in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Mr Almunia, we appreciate your efforts, but believe that some banks were rescued from bankruptcy at that time that experienced difficulties not just because of the Lehman Brothers collapse, which is why we would expressly request that you look very closely at this issue and examine critically the criteria used by the Member States in awarding state aid in the banking sector. Of course, this is still a little early and new problems are arising all the time. Nonetheless, we wanted to make a clear appeal to you in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second focus is on the energy sector, where consumer protection plays a major role. We want to see the oligarchy-like structures found in the energy sector come more under the control of the European Commission because consumers often get the impression that they have very few rights in relation to the energy providers and the structure of energy supply in Europe is still not as competitive as we would like.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the report deals with legal issues in relation to the guiding principles and Council Regulation No 1/2003, which provide the basis for the European Commission’s decisions on fines. Our particular wish here is that this proposal in relation to what you call mono-product businesses, in other words small and medium-sized enterprises, should be implemented soon.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the excellent cooperation with the European Commission on the restructuring of these reports, which should make them somewhat easier to read and to explain to others. We hope that we can succeed in focusing on the value of competition policy for consumer protection and for Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, many thanks, Mr Schwab for your good work in producing this report on our Annual Report on EU Competition Policy 2010. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs of other committees of this House, such as the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, who have also contributed to the report, for the work carried out by them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Report on Competition Policy 2010, the Commission provides an account of its actions, as every year. As Mr Schwab says, there are already 40 reports on the development of a policy that is central to the realisation of the internal market and to the creation of conditions for economic growth, innovation and, generally, for the progress of our economies, thinking always – and I agree with what Mr Schwab has said – of citizens as consumers of goods or users of services, these being the ultimate beneficiaries of competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are developing competition policy in times of crisis and I agree with Mr Schwab’s opinion, and we discussed this recently in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, when I presented the Commission’s Work Programme for 2012 in this area: competition policy must take into account the fact that we are in crisis, but must not be weakened by the fact that we are in crisis, whether in the fight against cartels, where, of course, we have to continue to be extremely rigorous, or in the policy and in actions against abuses of dominant market position. In difficult times, it has a much more negative effect on companies and on all citizens if those in a position of power in the market abuse their power in order to obtain particular advantages to the detriment of other competitors and to the detriment of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to be vigilant as regards the possible competition risks of mergers and acquisitions, which are beginning to pick up because there is a lot of liquidity in companies and funds both within and beyond EU boundaries and there are purchase prices for assets and purchase prices for companies which have reduced as a consequence of the crisis and that give rise to opportunities. Accordingly, we continue to be active in every aspect of the fight against cartels, the abuse of dominant position and merger and acquisition control policy, above all because we are in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as Mr Schwab has said, the control of state aid, of public aid, is fundamental. On the one hand, in times of crisis, public aid increases and at this point I will refer specifically to aid to the financial system although aid to non-financial sectors has also increased during the years of crisis, and we have had a specific timeframe for the control of state aid in times of crisis, which has prevented protectionist temptations from materialising and has prevented the creation of barriers in the internal market as a consequence of public aid being used defensively to protect the companies of one country against the rest of the countries of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment in time, that public aid framework is subject to limits in the majority of Member States and since the Member States are subject to very strict fiscal consolidation programmes, they have to prioritise the use of their public funds much better and much more carefully. Accordingly, in regulating state aid we must not encourage Member States to spend more but rather we must be strict in controlling public aid so that they spend more wisely and fine-tune their priorities. Resources are scarcer in public coffers and the need to encourage those activities that have a future, those activities that must pull our economies along and move towards an inclusive model of sustainable growth that is compatible with our environmental objectives is key.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is aid to the financial system. As Mr Schwab has said, right from the start of the crisis in 2007 but above all since Lehman went into liquidation in September 2008 we, the Member States and the European institutions, have faced a dilemma. Either we authorised exceptional aid for the financial system or the financial system collapsed, and the collapse of the financial system would have frozen our economic activities for we cannot maintain economic activity without a reasonable functioning of the financial system. However, that public aid, basically in the form of bank guarantees and other forms of security but also the injection of public capital into a series of financial entities, or liquidity support or measures for dealing with impaired assets, has reached a level that is beyond considerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, through me as Competition Commissioner, has sent this Parliament a document, a study not only of the scale of such aid but also of its impact through to the end of 2010, a study which can, I hope, be updated in the coming months to take account of what has happened in 2011. Such aid to the financial system has, in general terms, resulted in about 9-10 points of GDP being offered in the form of guarantees or other forms of security by Member States in support of the financial system.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that so far those guarantees and other forms of security have only been called upon in one case; in the rest of the cases it is a risk but a risk that has not materialised and that in the meantime permits Member States to receive income in exchange for providing that protection, that guarantee. About 3% of European GDP has been channelled to financial entities by way of public capital. That public capital has begun to be returned but there are still very significant financial entities in several EU countries in the capital of which the State has had to take a holding and in those cases there is clearly an assumption of risk. One per cent of GDP is aimed at public resources for dealing with impaired assets.</p>
<p class="contents">I had hoped to bring this special system, which is an exceptional system for times of crisis, to an end at the end of this year. Unfortunately, this is impossible with the new tensions that have been noted in the market since the summer, since August. We need to continue with this exceptional framework, this exceptional system of public aid for the financial system in times of crisis. I hope that in a few months, before the end of 2012, I will be able to come to this House to tell you that that system is no longer necessary but in the meantime it will be necessary, with the adaptations that we have included.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing that I can say over and over again, which I have already said in this plenary session and on several occasions in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, is that the rigour that we apply to the control of such aid and the requirements imposed in exchange for such aid, in terms of restructuring of the entities that benefit, in terms of adequate burden-sharing between all the parties who benefit from such aid and the establishment of terms and conditions so that additional distortions are not created in our internal market as a consequence of such aid, those three principles still hold good and in fact hold good now more than ever to the extent that the need for that special treatment in times of crisis lasts longer than three years.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I wanted to say. I express my thanks once again for the work carried out by Mr Schwab, by his colleagues on other committees and by the members of this Parliament in the form of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with Mr Schwab that from the next edition onwards, as discussed with him and his colleagues, the report will be more of a summary insofar as it relates to information that is available from other sources. We will not repeat information in the report that is available in real time on websites or that has been made available previously. In the report we will provide a better focus on questions that deserve special analysis and discussion because, as the honourable Members know, although many of the decisions in competition policy fall exclusively within the competence of the Commission, my intention from the outset has been and will remain until the end to keep Parliament involved on a permanent basis and in ongoing dialogue with the Commission so that EU competition policy meets all of its objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Competition policy within the single market is a key area in which Europe can deliver for its citizens. It has brought many benefits for consumers: reducing costs, making the single market more efficient and removing unjustified obstacles to the free movement of goods, services and capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Although competition policy has made great progress in many areas, failures still remain with regard to price transparency, the food supply change and energy prices. Mr Almunia, I agree with you and with Mr Schwab’s comments about controlling state aid. I know we are living in exceptional times but we look forward to you making progress on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing price transparency should be our key goal for 2012. It is essential for consumers so that they can assess the market and analyse pricing structures. This will help lower prices for all our constituents; something which is more necessary than ever at this difficult time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The procedures for identifying failure to meet obligations, initiated by the Commission against Member States for not implementing the First Railway Package properly, must be continued.

<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation – 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy. Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks. I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks. Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead. Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control. It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been much cooperation and good work done between us, the shadows and the competition taskforce which was set up, to which we all belong.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a new year, Commissioner, for Parliament and Commission relations, which have been very positive and fruitful. We have made positive progress in key areas. We have looked at sector-specific issues, such as state aid, and sectors of general economic interest, for example. These are proving fruitful engagements with the Commission, but much more must still be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report – as the rapporteur has just indicated – we have targeted certain specific aspects of interest. I will outline two. First, fining policy, where we have called for greater transparency in the procedures in determining fines adopted for cartels. I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur on the need to balance the protection of the consumer with a fair, clear procedure proportionate to the effects. On state aid and the financial sector – much mentioned just now – Member States, either at municipal or federal level, have been forced to stabilise the financial situations in their countries. The Commission is right not to pull the carpet from under the feet of this stability. However, we do need to establish the correct controls to ensure that the level playing field is not ignored. We have to determine what the real need is instead of what is just for advantage and could be proved to be advantageous.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the S&amp;D Group supports this report and supports the rapporteur’s work. He has done much to bring together many of the aspects that we have agreed – and perhaps even disagreed – on in the past. I think these issues are right to be discussed here and I wish him the very best in success on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done an excellent job.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Liberals attach great importance to competition policies, not only as a means of protecting consumer interests – as was rightly pointed out – but also to foster innovative, dynamic and competitive European markets. We need to realise that we are not just competing with each other, but that Europe should also be a strong economic actor in the global markets. We need strong competition policies and controls, in particular in times of economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Almunia is absolutely right when he says that in these times state aid rules should not be relaxed, but they should actually be much tighter and much stricter than normal, because we have to keep in mind that state aid distorts competition. It is also a question of taxpayers’ money in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding state aid for banks, there is a very good proposal in paragraph 14 of the report for a European system – European solutions – for failing banks. If we had had a European solution then maybe the whole problem of banks that were too big to fail would have had a completely different dimension, because banks are only too big to fail in relation to the authority that bails them out. In contrast, I am not very happy about an earlier report by this House that calls for relaxing the state aid rules for services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">On the competition dialogue, I am very pleased with the proposals. Our proposals in no way undermine or impinge upon the powers of the European Commission. Quite on the contrary; they reflect the reality of the development of a political union in which economic policies and economic coordination become ever more important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the fact that the European Commission now seems to be moving in the direction of a sector inquiry into online and search advertising. This was long overdue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, some banks have become too large and too important, thereby gaining intolerable market power. They are able to squeeze out smaller competitors and to absorb the activities hitherto carried out by others. I have in mind the activities of stock exchanges, in which they want to assert themselves as marketplaces in place of the established exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">Not content with abusing their market power, the largest of these banks seek to gain political power, the most shocking example of which is, in my opinion, the welcome accorded to the head of Deutsche Bank at the Summit of Heads of State or Government held on 21 July, with all the regard to due to Heads of State.</p>
<p class="contents">How is this possible? Because, on the one hand, these large banks enjoy the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer – as Ms in ’t Veld has pointed out – but also, on the other hand, because the European Central Bank (ECB) grants them a guarantee of lender of last resort; in other words it guarantees them unlimited liquidity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is striking to note that this same bank, the ECB, which finds it intolerable to give a guarantee of lender of last resort to the Member States, has absolutely no problem giving this very same guarantee to private institutions. This is simply the result of an ideological choice, which consists in saying that, by their very nature, governments and states are not trustworthy, whereas banks – large or small – are. This ideological mould clearly has to be broken. </p>

This is where we will see if we can find, in this House, a majority to reduce the banking industry to a size, and to introduce practices, more compatible with the general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to know that the European Commission increasingly uses economic analyses when shaping competition policy, and I hope that it will continue to follow this course in the future; ultimately competition is about economics.</p>
<p class="contents">A balanced approach to competition policy combines elements of both public and private enforcement. Public enforcement is essential to fully achieve the goals of the single market and to ensure the enforcement of EU competition law by the Commission and by the national competition authorities. Private enforcement is compensatory in nature, in the sense that it promotes a personal interest in the private actor initiating it. However, private actions also help to pursue the public interest of deterrence.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned at a meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in October that, when it comes to collective redress, Mr Lehne behaves like a shadow Commissioner for competition policy. The ECR Group cannot support his approach of a horizontal instrument. We would like to see a system of access to national collective redress systems for those in other Member States, based on a non-binding framework and specific sectoral measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2010 competition policy report I appreciate very much the emphasis on the need to discontinue as soon as possible the temporary state aid rules adopted in the context of the financial and economic crisis. Furthermore, I strongly support the suggestion to the Commission that it should take into account the impact, in terms of distortion of competition, of ECB liquidity support provided to banks during the rescue stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me thank Mr Schwab, the rapporteur, for his good cooperation. I hope that we can continue to work together in the same constructive spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report deals with some areas that are still problematic, such as telecommunications and banking. The latter especially so, given the major changes that have taken place over the last few months. However, there is one sector that has not been mentioned on which I tabled a question to the Commission, which replied to me this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to insurance, especially car and motorcycle insurance. The Commission claims that there are no problems because of the number of players on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my view, it is not just quantity that creates competition, but also and above all quality. It would appear that quality is something that is missing in Italy, if, as is the case, there has been a general, widespread and substantial rise in policy costs, which is clearly to the detriment of all citizens and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Banking is another sector that merits special attention, and in fact over the last few months several European countries have had to intervene to save a large number of banks from failing. I do not wish to see the banking giants again taking advantage to implement policies – often agreed amongst themselves – which do not take the slightest notice of the real needs of ordinary customers and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in basic banking services there seem to be agreements that lack transparency, which keep prices high across the board. This approach makes it impossible to have a real and effective alternative, and fails to comply with the basic and essential rules of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must continue to deal with the core problems. Mr Ferber and Mr Lamberts have referred to these already. There has been a failure in the banking sector. The fact that we allowed so many institutions to be created within the framework of the internal market that have now become systemic risks is something that taxpayers are now being asked to take on the chin. You need to take action here and abandon the ideologically blinkered approach that allows you to justify your inaction.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the question of antitrust law. Here, too, it is high time that we analysed the key figures used to evaluate market dominance on a pan-European basis and considered whether we do not need closer measurement here. It is evident in a large number of areas that this one-third principle also leads to concentrations that tend to disadvantage individual consumers, rather than bringing them benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">This report was produced at a time when we were still unaware of the decisions of the last EU summit. It will be very interesting to see what the consequences will be in the City of London of the British Government’s announced withdrawal and what conclusions the Commission will draw from this.

However, it is just as important, or perhaps even more important, to think and talk about how we will promote economic growth than it is to think about how to save money. The key issue and the opportunity for us to promote economic growth in Europe is to directly increase internal competition within the European Union. There are two areas I want to discuss in particular: the service sector and the energy sector. The service sector in the European Union accounts for 70% of all economic activity, but we know that unfortunately many businesses are actually still denied the opportunity to operate cross-border. This sector has to be opened up. The same applies to the energy sector. We know very well that in many European Union Member States no competition actually exists in the energy market. For example, in Latvia’s gas sector, there still exists a 100% monopoly; moreover, a monopoly that is a subsidiary of a third country. Thus, in order to promote economic growth in the European Union, serious attention should be devoted to increasing competition in both the service sector and the energy sector. All European citizens will benefit. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The various reports reflect the evolution of competition policy and its essential role in the sustainability of the European project. Competition policy has established a demanding framework for extraordinary responses to the crisis, responses which, in many cases, take the form of recapitalisation, guarantees and liquidity support. The responses must be proportional; they must establish a fair division of responsibility and not distort the markets to the detriment of competitors which in the end belong to customers, consumers, taxpayers and all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">One key aspect of this report relates to the exercise of collective actions so that the victims of competition breaches can obtain compensation for damages. We have reached an important consensus in committee with the invaluable contribution of Mr Schwab. Sadly, however, the chosen method of incorporating it as an annex to this report was considered unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, therefore, has been severely hacked about. What I propose is that voting be postponed so that we can incorporate the set of compromises reached on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs and this can be supported by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has announced the launch of an initiative during the next year on this subject and this initiative brooks no delay. Parliament can ensure its consistency with other initiatives that may be adopted and the Commission must present it ambitiously, taking into account the specifics of competition law and contemplating all necessary measures to ensure its effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are an important watchdog in a Europe that, in the wake of the economic crisis, has seen far too many state interventions in order to deal with acute situations. We know that the banking and automotive sectors have had a difficult time, but temporary measures must be exactly that – temporary – so that aid does not distort competition. In this regard, the Commission certainly has a delicate task weighing up the various interests in bleak times.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to develop more ways of strengthening consumers’ rights, and one such way is precisely by means of these group claims. Joining together in a group claim makes consumers’ position stronger and they can assert their rights more easily than if they were standing alone. Europe needs a modern legal system in order to safeguard the rights of ordinary consumers, but not an American system. I think that Mr Eppink ought to have a rethink. It is disappointing that the EU can never get down to action, and this unfortunately applies to the European Parliament, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to ensure that the EU single market becomes a competitive and dynamic place to do business again.</p>
<p class="contents">One area where we must move cautiously is in the development of an increasingly complex regulatory environment, especially for global financial services, where reducing risk needs to be balanced with damaging our global competitiveness. We should only regulate where there has been a proven need and with proportionate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">An example would be the G20 agreement to better regulate the world’s derivative markets. However, when we mandate the use of post-trade activities, such as central clearing, we need to ensure that we are not now mandating a new EU monopoly of service. With increased competition comes natural fragmentation of the market, which is then often followed by a wave of consolidation. We are seeing this trend in the plethora of training venues which emerged post-MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and are now witnessing market consolidation amongst exchanges and Multilateral Trading Facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation needs to be able to withstand these market trends and, where it cannot adequately do so, DG Competition will need to protect Europe’s competitive landscape. We need to ensure effective competition policy at all times so we can encourage new entrants and innovation. This is the only way we will grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the Union’s extensive and numerous measures to support honest and fair competition in trade, our citizens are still indicating certain reservations to us about the fair behaviour of entities on the European market. In the area of food prices in particular, opacity of price setting is a very sensitive and closely monitored issue. A more precise analysis of costs, prices and margins in all areas of the food supply chain would certainly contribute to the objectification of price rises and to an increase in consumer confidence. Similarly, the sustained increases in energy prices result in, and are marked by, substantial consumer mistrust and the belief that energy suppliers are abusing their dominant position. Greater transparency in the setting of energy prices and improved supervision of regulatory authorities could help to restore consumer confidence in this area as well. The lack of real competition in the mobile operator roaming market is also a problem which is reflected in prices and worries most of our citizens daily.</p>

As a result of the worldwide financial crisis, however, the environment has become a little tougher. Thus, aid to the banks in EU Member States may be questionable in terms of market economics, but it is nonetheless something that cannot be avoided. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we insisted that these measures must be linked to strict regulations beyond 2011. Distortions of competition are to be avoided, all aid that leads to greater market clout for a few large banks is to be questioned. We are calling for sanctions, such as monetary fines, for example, whenever anticompetitive practices are uncovered. Violations of antitrust law should receive stiff penalties, transparent framework conditions should provide for greater competitiveness in implementing the single market for energy, as well as in the still underdeveloped area of cross-border transactions. The same should apply to rating agencies, which tend to abuse their dominant position. The EU must be ready to play an active role in international networks, taking on positions of leadership.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the assessments published by these agencies are not simple opinions. They affect the well-being of all European citizens by pushing up interest rates and increasing price volatility. However, we lack strict regulations on transparency and on making the agencies accountable for the errors they have made.

This is why I welcome its recent proposal on this matter, while emphasising that the option of setting up a public European credit rating agency needs to be considered. The aim of making such an institution independent from the private sector would be to increase competition and eliminate conflicts of interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are three points I wish to raise for discussion. With regard to the temporary state aid regime, we must acknowledge that this regime has been useful and that it was basically a good idea to extend it. We cannot, of course, continue extending it indefinitely and, if we are going to need to make these extensions, we must add strict conditions, especially with regard to the banking system. I am referring here to the distribution of dividends and the size of the balance sheet, because a balance needs to be struck between the banking system’s stability and an adequate level of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the energy package, I urge the Commission to be extremely vigilant at a time when most Member States are late in implementing the Third Energy Package. With regard to the amount of the antitrust fines, I agree on staggering the payments, as there is no need for us to make European businesses bankrupt. However, this must not be an excuse either for those who deliberately engaged in anticompetitive practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to draw attention to something that is rather odd: we are examining a report for the year 2010, almost 12 months after its completion. I believe that in future Parliament should do its utmost to speed up work, particularly since competition policy is a fundamental tool for improving the quality of goods and services, as well as increasing consumer well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of goods, services and capital stimulates the development of the single market, at the same time as strengthening consumer protection. A sustainable pricing policy is crucial for boosting competition and increasing the value of product choice. A particularly conspicuous example is the lack of competition in the roaming market. Despite the introduction of the new framework legislation in this area, there is still an obvious need for yet greater price transparency. Further action is therefore necessary in order to achieve the aim of eliminating differences between the cost of roaming and domestic tariffs. Something else that should attract our attention is poor price transparency and the complexity of the supply chain in the food sector. Providing consumers with more choice and avoiding unfair discrimination will certainly help to improve the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key here is the role of the common market, whose proper functioning and development is in fact determined by competition policy. The policy of strengthening competitiveness may become an effective tool in the fight against the crisis, but it must be properly targeted in order for this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We all remember the spectacular disaster of the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the European Union the most competitive economy in the world. Attempts to make the EU the most competitive global economy have failed because the previous paradigm of economic integration has changed. All attempts to control the economy at European level, including the Lisbon Strategy itself, have met with disaster. Competition policy should therefore be used to uncover Europe’s hidden economic potential, instead of being a tool for complex economic engineering. We must not forget this, especially at a time of crisis, when competitiveness policy has a special role to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The call for an investigation into the situation in the retail sector because of alleged abuse of market power by dominant retail chains is particularly welcome. But it is not just because it would have a negative effect on small retailers and producers, it also has a negative effect on consumers. If we have too few controlling this chain, we will have less choice as consumers, and that is really bad for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I gather that the high-level forum for the better functioning of the food supply chain is making some slow progress.

I would like to draw attention to the following problems. Firstly, concentration, mergers and fusions can improve cost-effectiveness and strengthen the market position of the newly formed business unit, but we must remember that market domination and monopolisation leads to restricted competition and a worse position for consumers. Secondly, in recent times we have allocated huge amounts to rescue banks. Ultimately, these sums were paid by the taxpayer. At the same time, the programme for the free distribution of food to the most deprived in the European Union has been blocked for over two years, its cost being only EUR 500 million per year. Finally, the energy market must be monitored very closely both at EU level and nationally, since the present increase in energy costs is a very pressing problem for consumers. A similar situation can be seen in the food market. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to repeat a point that I mentioned in my initial intervention: aid for banks, which is very important, is not something that is decided by the European Commission. The European Commission is responsible for controlling the conditions according to which such aid may be compatible and the consequences for the financial entities that receive such aid, in terms of restructuring. It is not possible for a financial entity to receive a single euro of public money unless it puts forward a restructuring plan. In the same way, the Commission controls the conditions on which efforts are shared: it is not only taxpayers who have to make efforts to restructure entities through their governments and their treasuries; the shareholders and all the parties involved in the financial entity also have to contribute, and the Commission sees to this. All that public aid, all that enormous effort, must avoid creating distortions in competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that not everything can be done by controlling state aid. In fact, through the control of state aid in the financial system, the Commission is compensating for the absence of a European authority for resolving crisis in financial entities and my colleague, Michel Barnier, is preparing proposals in this regard, which you will soon have the opportunity to discuss. It is imperative that that financial regulation should enable us to provide ourselves with tools that do not exist today on a European scale and that do not even exist in many European countries. It is only the existence of control over state aid that enables us to make up for that absence but it is not possible to carry on like this indefinitely. There are, of course, many other things to be done in order to prevent the financial crisis and its consequences on the banks and the real economy dragging on and that debate is very important but now is not the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make a final reference to other issues that you have raised in debate: the extraordinarily important issues relating to the private enforcement of competition policy. The Commission’s Work Programme for next year includes a proposed legislative initiative in this regard. The debate on collective actions in relation to such private enforcement of competition policy is very important. We await the conclusions of the debate in this House with interest before presenting our own ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to improve the rights of the parties in any investigative process on competition matters and we have improved those rights recently. It is very important to have regard to competition problems in particular economic sectors and I agree fully with those who have mentioned energy, telecommunications, railways, air travel, the food sector, services and the financial markets. In all these areas we are working very hard, both from the point of view of the abuse of dominant positions – that is, to prevent abuses of dominant positions – and from the point of view of merger control and the fight against cartels. Of course, it is very important – and this is my final point, Madam President – that putting our principles and rules on free competition into practice in a rigorous fashion not only enables us to develop the internal market for the benefit of our citizens but also enables us to be competitive within and beyond our borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I concur with Mr Bielan that this needs to be placed on a permanent footing and that one or two errors have been made in our haste, which is why we intend to postpone the vote until February so that paragraph 21 can be recast to meet all the formalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have heard several references to the idea of collective legal protection. I would point out that I have been able to agree on a good compromise with the rapporteur of the competent committee – the Committee on Legal Affairs – in relation to the questions regarding competition policy – specifically the areas relating to key witness provision and follow-up action – so that we have been able to agree on a common line in terms of Parliament’s opinion. I hope that this will be possible to do this with my fellow shadow rapporteurs as soon as possible in the New Year.</p>
<p class="contents">When Ludwig Erhard introduced competition policy, or antitrust controls and merger controls, based on the Freiburg School in Germany in the 1950s, industry was extremely critical and sceptical in its attitude. At the time it was seen as an attack on industry. Today we find that industry, in particular smaller and medium-sized enterprises, recognise great benefits in competition policy, which is why it has become to some extent the centrepiece of European economic policy, so that we can only heartily support the Commission and the Competition Commissioner in his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clear criteria must be set for the provision of state aid, which must be checked thoroughly.

The doctor diagnosed various contusions, problems with the neck muscles and dangerously high blood pressure as a consequence of the violence. This attack on a Member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. The President, the offices of the European Parliament and the national authorities have made representations to the Moroccan Government. So far there has been no response from Morocco. We cannot simply accept this without a word. I would ask for your solidarity. This outrageous incident is an opportunity for me to remind us all, yet again, that the people of Western Sahara have been suffering for decades as a result of the inability of politicians to bring about a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. I believe that we can no longer remain silent. We should focus more on this issue in the second half of this electoral term.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. -</span></span>   Dear Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, honourable guests, ‘If Sparta and Rome perished,’ wrote Jean Jacques Rousseau, ‘what state can hope to last for ever?’ No human institutions are immortal. We Europeans must not be deluded into thinking that our Union is somehow an exception. To remain strong it requires an investment every day in our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">To understand where we are today, we need a historic context. In this recent period of prosperity, we fell into the illusion that the EU could simply sail on forever. We have not prepared our Community for difficult and more challenging times. We did not have enough political will and we did not convince our citizens of such a project. We even broke our own rules. Discipline was lost. Three years ago the financial crisis sailed across the Atlantic. We were not prepared for such a situation. Arguments about self-interest began to erode our belief in the common good. And now, our Union has moved into a deep crisis whose causes are as much political and psychological, as economic.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the European Parliament I served you, and Europe’s citizens. I have been incredibly honoured by your choice of two-and-a-half years ago, given with such a great majority. I succeeded my dear friend Hans-Gert Pöttering in office, whom I thank once again for his excellent leadership. I was competing for this post with Ms Eva-Britt Svensson who is not present with us today, but to whom I send my warmest regards. I also pay tribute to our colleagues Mario Mauro and Graham Watson, who supported my candidature to ensure the unity of this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I did everything in order not to disappoint your trust. I knew that I could count on you, no matter what our views were. Today I would like to give my report on the work of our Parliament: your work, as well as mine. This is not a detailed report. You will find such a document in your mailboxes in the new year. However, I would like to present what we have achieved together, and what still remains ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">You know as well as I do that my term as President coincided with an exceptionally difficult time for Europe. First, we introduced the Treaty of Lisbon. Second, we faced the crisis. Third, we observed globalisation at an incredible speed. Fourth, we faced the most important decisions for our future. I wish to outline these four points with you today.</p>
<p class="contents">First, let us remind ourselves that in the summer of 2009 we faced the threat that the Treaty of Lisbon might not be ratified by all Member States. I started from convincing the still unconvinced that we needed more Europe. My first official visit was to Ireland, just before the second referendum. Then I went to meet the Czech President. I will never forget that discussion. It started bluntly and ended very positively.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon changed the way our European Union functions. For me, the most important was Parliament’s place in EU decision-making. We are now the Parliament we always wanted to be.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are now the Parliament we always wanted to be: a full co-legislator in a two-chamber structure. We achieved a lot, but this is a fight we all need to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">To be strong is simply not enough; we need to use our power in everyday practice and to decide. I am proud that the European Parliament, in cooperation with the other EU institutions, is ready to prepare in a few weeks’ time a deep and comprehensive programme to help solve our current economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Jean Monnet once said ‘everybody is ambitious. The question is whether he or she is ambitious to be or ambitious to do’. We should be ambitious ‘to do’, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">You, the Members of the European Parliament, co-decide on nearly all the essential policies and give your consent on almost all international agreements. Who will ever forget our decision to block the SWIFT Agreement with the United States in order to protect the rights of our citizens? I remember the night before the vote, I received a phone call from the US Secretary of State. I told her that as a former Senator, she knows and understands about democratic oversight. She did, and she agreed later during her visit to the European Parliament, that today we have a better agreement than the first one.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens expect that we exercise power, proper parliamentary scrutiny. In the spirit of Lisbon we have pushed for greater accountability of the European Commission. We negotiated a better Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission. The candidate for the President of the Commission came for the first time to our political groups to discuss his five-year manifesto. We established the monthly Question Hour with the President of the European Commission and Commissioners. We used our powers to shape the new European External Action Service so that it was more accountable and representative for the Community as a whole. We insisted on hearings of EU Ambassadors to key posts and that the Vice-President/High Representative should report back to plenary on a regular basis. Equally, we shaped a new relationship with the European Council and its President.</p>
<p class="contents">But with new powers comes increased responsibility and increased demands for credibility and transparency. So as a Parliament we also had to respond to that. I am very proud today to say we introduced our own Code of Conduct for Members. It was adopted with a huge majority and was applauded for its clarity and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should remain committed to the letter and the spirit of what the Treaty of Lisbon represents – using the European institutions and creating a common good and common solutions for the whole community.</p>
<p class="contents">Challenge number two was the need for action and overcoming the crisis. Over the last two and a half years we had to deal with a series of very difficult economic and international challenges. We had a crisis within the EU but we also had a critical situation at our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">When you elected me as President of the European Parliament, we all thought that the international banking crisis was coming to an end. Instead it came to our shores and took away wealth and jobs from millions of our citizens. Responding to that challenge became our highest priority as the crisis brought an enormous threat to our citizens. A broad package of laws – the ‘six-pack’ – entered into force just two days ago and our European Parliament can be proud of the role it played in shaping this legislation. It is a new economic anti-crisis shield making closer economic cooperation a reality. Thanks to our firmness, attempts to weaken this shield were not successful. Now it may even become a part of the new Treaty under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We passed legislation increasing the supervision of banks, insurers and the financial sector. For all three institutions responsible – Commission, Council and Parliament – and with their support I proposed a first fast-track procedure for a legislation aiming to combat the crisis; similar to what we used when we established a permanent stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">On your behalf I have often stressed the need to complete the internal market and to boost growth and competitiveness. As part of the crisis reaction I was engaged in contacts with the rotating presidencies, the President of the Commission, President Rompuy of the European Council and with the Head of the Euro Group and the President of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament called for more investment and for bigger support of research, development and green technologies. In today’s Europe, just as it was in the 1950s, energy is at the heart of our economy. This is why I made a special appeal with Jacques Delors to create a genuine European Energy Community. I was proud that this plenary supported this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn to the challenges we faced in our neighbourhood, both to the south and to the east. If you will permit me I would like to admit a difficult truth. For many years we looked for stability, while not being seriously engaged in defending human rights and building democracy in our neighbourhood. But long-term stability can only come from democracy. We learned this from our history but did not apply it to our closest neighbours. Our Arab neighbours have reminded us that freedom and democracy are for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand we, European parliamentarians, were always strong defenders and supporters of all people fighting for freedom, democracy and human dignity. Our annual Sakharov Prize is the most visible example of this. In Parliament we were the first politicians to call for Gaddafi to step down. When I spoke to protestors in Tahrir Square in Cairo and freedom fighters in Martyrs’ Square in Tripoli, they told me: ‘Thank you, Europe. Thank you for believing and being with us.’ I heard from the Prime Minister of Tunisia that ‘the only way for us is Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">However we cannot support democracy only by words. Our external policies and our internal policies must be linked as we, together with the European Commission, proposed in our new neighbourhood policy. If we want to export our democratic model, we need to invest there and to open step-by-step our market for their goods and services. Long-term democracy and stability can only come from growing prosperity – step-by-step.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may add one additional remark: I visited the Choucha refugee camp in Tunisia. If we want to present ourselves as credible to our neighbours, we must respond to their expectations and help with their refugee crisis. Three thousand people not having the possibility to go back to their countries is something that the EU should be able to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a lighthouse, a beacon for people across the Mediterranean, but also for those to the east of us: in Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and many others. This is why I urged, together with many of you, for the creation of the EuroNest Parliamentary Assembly. It is one of our successes. When I travelled from Baku to Yerevan, from Tbilisi to Chisinau, I tried to explain that sitting and negotiating at the same table gives hope for lasting peace. Unfortunately, I regret the situation in Belarus today seems to be worse than it was some thirty months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about the EU’s activities in our neighbourhood, I would like to make a general remark. I am a strong believer in the power of our parliamentary diplomacy. We are trusted both by society and local leaders. This was a success for example in Moldova. One year ago I was actively involved in bringing the various parties to the negotiating table in the efforts to form a pro-European alliance and to move forward with their reforms. Our European ‘soft power’ seems to be as strong as ‘hard power’ when we promote our values and create democratic institutions and procedures. We can see this in the Western Balkans for example.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, as a Parliament we have pushed the human rights agenda very strongly; we have created the Sakharov Prize network as a permanent dialogue on human rights. You and I have spoken hundreds of times on various official visits – to China, to Russia, to the South Caucasus, in defence of individual cases. For someone who was born in an occupied country and brought up in an oppressed country, it is natural to argue for human rights and human dignity. I was proud to see the support I received from you when I came to standing up for this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not forget that in many countries in the world women are still oppressed and humiliated. I was a strong partisan of equal treatment of men and women –in politics, in business and in social and family life – in the world and in Europe. Women’s rights are simply human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Point number three: today citizens’ ‘virtual participation’ is changing the world we live in.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, citizens are much better connected. They are as well-informed as politicians are. This brings quite a new challenge. How to ensure credibility in the decision-making process? How to ensure trust for the activities of our politicians? What can be the role of the European Parliament in this context?</p>
<p class="contents">Today, a particular responsibility lies with Parliament – it is not only a guarantor of the stability of the political scene, but also has the task of creating a courageous vision for Europe. The citizens expect that it will present such a vision and a new kind of European dream.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconnecting the citizens will help to give another non-economic meaning to the definition of deepening and widening of Europe. Governance, free markets, the single currency – these are absolutely insufficient as a basis for community. We need one more crucial factor. The most important one: European civic activity. As Jean Monnet said, ‘we are not uniting states, we are uniting human beings.’</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address the citizens of Europe directly. I understand that you may be disappointed, but Europe in many respects is the best place in the world. It is our European diversity, creativity and openness that can best satisfy your aspirations and passions. Log in to our common European space; it is your space.</p>
<p class="contents">And please do not let yourself be persuaded that there is a contradiction between being a good Pole and a good European, a good British citizen and a European citizen, a good Spaniard and at the same time a good European. This alternative is an absolutely false one. Europe allows you to discover the magic of the word ‘and’: being a good citizen of your town, region, country <span class="italic">and</span> your continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, through this crisis we are starting to see the emergence of a true demos. Europeans can see how interdependent we are. One country can undermine the whole economy, but many countries working together can solve the problem. This is why I have pushed for greater dialogue with people and promoted the idea of a European civic space and in all my visits within the EU. Democracy built in such a way could be stronger than financial markets which are so influential in our political decisions and everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">And the last point is about planning for our European Union, our common future. I believe that we need something like a New Deal for Europe. Our real problem is the lack of mutual trust and the loss of a sense of meaning. The historian Norman Davis wrote in Vanished Kingdoms, ‘it is precisely through such a loss of purpose that powers fall’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a common project and not a mortgage on the next generation’s future. In the 1930s, while our continent was sliding towards tragedy, President Roosevelt saved democracy and the free market economy in the United States of America with his New Deal. Today our crisis demands a New Deal for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat shortly what I already said, and share my own vision of the future in three points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need a new wave of political integration. For the long term, the Community interest benefits our individual interest. The idea of a common civilisation and cultural space has been strong in Europe for centuries. What we need today is to find the optimal political solution that will be fitting for our times. Let me be very clear, we do not want a superstate. So let us decide how in practice we can realise the idea of ‘unity in diversity’, while redesigning the necessary solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">While discussing possible treaty changes or new treaties, I want to recall that without a return to a genuine spirit of cooperation or – a ‘destiny shared in common’ as Robert Schuman put it – we will not succeed. Change is not about new rules. It is about a commitment to live by those rules. This is about a state of mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need a new wave of economic integration. We need to create a real fiscal and economic union. John Donne once said, ‘no man is an island’. I would say, no country is an island and I do not speak about geography. Member States that want to go forward need to respect the Treaty of Lisbon. No country has the right to stop others working closer together. Those who stay outside cannot expect to be main players.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My hope remains that the frictions that have appeared using this intergovernmental method will lead to more, not less, use of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Community method. For this reason I call for a greater involvement of the European Parliament in this discussion and the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Third and last point, we need to create a true European Civic Space. As I mentioned earlier, while creating a new vision for Europe we need to discuss issues which are close to each of us: security, the possibility to realise your own destiny, an active life in local communities, and the feeling of belonging.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs more solidarity, more responsibility, more respect for values, as well as enthusiasm. It was built on dreams and we have no right to throw those dreams away.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to better reconnect with Europeans, those who think of profit must also think of values. Those who gain wealth must be responsible. Those who are concerned about their prosperity – about which there is nothing wrong – must be concerned about equality, and those who believe in competition must come to believe in justice.</p>
<p class="contents">My last sentences: I would like to thank each and every Member of the European Parliament for your contribution and cooperation. Throughout my term in office I have played a part in resolving the tensions between the various EU institutions, leaders of Member States, and the states themselves. On many occasions I have been close to losing hope that a settlement would be found. But in general, we reached a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am optimistic today. I have never had doubts about a common Europe. Representing you in Europe, and around the world, I was able to perceive the full, distinctive borders of the European project, as well as its exceptional, human, moral, economic and cultural potential. The European Union is an incredible value, one worth working for and living in. But it is a value that can be created and used only if we are united.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this very Europe that I will always serve with energy and determination. It is not only as Hungarian, Czech, Swedish, French or German men and women that we sit in this House. We also sit here as Europeans, to solve European problems and come up with joint solutions. I dream of this European Parliament, uniting so many nations, being a body making real changes on behalf of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">–</span>I can say with great pride: I am a Pole and a European, and this is why I believe so strongly in our common European future. Let us never take our European integration for granted as something we have achieved once and for all; we must strive towards it every day. Thank you very much.</p>

This does not only mean accounting concerns, but also the means to ensure that the best possible use is being made of the funds. With the same aim in mind, better coordination is needed among donors, including on the reporting and auditing side. I wish to point out Article 22, which sets out extremely useful proposals on this subject.

One might say that is a little glitch, a little twitch or knob in the single market – though at GBP 500 million it seems quite a big one – but the single market has always had these imbalances, these national peculiarities.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always operated on the basis that some states have essential national interests. You cannot easily reform the common fisheries policy without this receiving a Spanish veto, or the common agricultural policy without a French veto. Germany has particular interests in its heavy industries and, of course, my own country has an interest in the financial services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference is, however, that our interest is in preserving the single market, and not in having some protectionist exemption. It was extraordinary to hear in the debate yesterday that the UK was somehow turning its back on the single market when all it was asking for was a guarantee that the single market would apply evenly to financial services and would not be applied asymmetrically, to the detriment of the main financial services sector in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the UK that has abandoned the free market principles which the Treaty of Rome enshrined, but rather the Member States which are pursuing this new union. This makes the UK’s departure, I am afraid, more or less inevitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it must promote cooperation between specialist border police departments not only in Member States but in third countries too. I should mention at this point the series of naval exercises carried out by the Romanian border police jointly with the Turkish coastguard in September 2011. This helps strengthen cooperation between the countries located in the Black Sea basin and reduces the intervention time in the event of maritime incidents.</p>

The European Maritime Safety Agency has already done a particularly important job in protecting the seas.

<p class="contents">However, I cannot support the widening focus of its role to inland navigation and recruitment of seafarers. Moreover, I believe the suggestion of it having an anti-pollution role is too controversial and thus cannot be supported. In particular, in my Member State, the UK, we have reservations regarding the extension of the Agency’s role in the analysis of the safety of mobile offshore oil and gas installations.

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank him for the welcome references to the new guidelines on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which will animate the future legal debate, and for recognising the value of innovative instruments such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Safety (GMES.)</p>

<p class="contents">Lastly, I found the text did not sufficiently cover the issue of transporting hazardous goods, which needs to be properly dealt with and regulated, both in order to avoid terrible accidents, and in order to manage accidents once they have happened, including in terms of the liability of the entities involved, institutions or otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This explains the need to combine different modes of cross-border transport in an efficient way in order to meet the requirements for safe, sustainable and environmentally-friendly transport. It is particularly necessary to extend Trans-European Transport Networks. Seventy-five per cent of transport is by road. Measured against gross domestic product, the transport sector accounts for 10% of the prosperity of the European Union and creates over 10 million jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Although a lot has improved, European infrastructure is still suffering from the after-effects of the Iron Curtain, and it is vital that the transport connections from East to West and from North to South should be significantly improved. Investment in infrastructure is crucial in order to generate economic growth into the future. That is why I have voted in favour of the motion and I am looking forward to the amendments that will now be produced. You have my thanks for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is every reason to be very worried about the situation in Uzbekistan with respect to human rights, democratisation and the rule of law. There is systematic use of forced labour in the textile industry there, involving children in particular. It has been completely impossible to monitor the health, working conditions and age of children and students, and the punishments they receive for disobedience, because Uzbekistan forbids foreign inspectors and human rights representatives to come into the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Uzbekistan’s actions violate international human rights obligations and the rules of the International Labour Organisation. Fortunately, retailers of textile products in Europe have now decided to stop buying cotton from Uzbekistan. That is an indication of the ethics and morals of European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on its own, this is still not enough. Parliament should not approve any trade agreement until the Uzbek authorities have allowed ILO observers into the country. It also needs to be confirmed that the country has implemented reforms and achieved notable results regarding the complete end to the use of forced labour and child labour, at national, regional and local level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It also quite appropriately requests the Commission to conduct a feasibility study on an effective traceability mechanism for goods produced, which would go some way to address the issue of forced child labour. The proposed agreement would also give Uzbek cotton the most-favoured-nation status thus allowing trade with the EU which is free from quantitative restrictions, which can only be good for the long-term development of Uzbekistan.</p>

<p class="contents">It is difficult to think of a more textbook case of a repressive regime than that in Uzbekistan. That beautiful country with the ancient cities of the Silk Road is being treated more or less as the personal property of the president’s family and of some of their cronies. There is an almost Caligulan tyranny there, and a regime which is involved in drug running and repression – two opponents of the regime were boiled to death while in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet the West has tended to hold back from criticism because in the uncertain days immediately after 9/11 the Karimov dictatorship had the wit to declare itself an ally in the war on terror and to make its bases available for use in the Afghan campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the error we make again and again in Muslim countries. We made it with the Shah in Iran, we made it in Egypt and we are making it in Saudi Arabia. There is no, or very little, fundamentalism in Uzbekistan. A traveller there does not see beards, does not perceive headscarves and does not hear the call to prayer. However, if we define every opponent of the Karimov tyranny as a fundamentalist, we will eventually make that prediction come true and we will create the very thing we purport to fear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why there is just one thing I would like to see: namely that we should pay due attention to this process – which I would again emphasise we all support – so that we do not overlook its negative effects, but rather make simple adjustments as and when necessary.

However, there is also a principle that applies not just within the European Union, but also under the rule of law, namely: <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> – treaties are to be honoured. According to the Treaty, a clause applies to the free movement of workers, setting down a period of three years, plus two years, plus two years. Accordingly, I was unable to support this resolution today, as it is just a symbol of a willingness to alter treaties while they are still in force. In my opinion, it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide. This is what it says in the Treaties. That was correct. Nonetheless, when the Treaties lapse and all restrictions run out, there will be no wave of mass migration to the old Member States from the other Member States. I am absolutely convinced that it is by working together that we will achieve progress in the European Union and that no more barriers should be imposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realise that there are people in this Parliament who avoid debates on a report that does not say anything or does not say a great deal, which is the case with this strategy on Central Asia. Although the European Union adopted a strategy in 2007 and this Parliament has two resolutions, the report does not actually assess the way in which this strategy has been applied. It is a litany of problems, expressed in terribly stilted language, which very clearly proves that no one is even familiar with the situation in the area. It mentions a security situation, ignoring that there are also neutral countries in the region. Nothing is known about these countries’ involvement in the situation of the conflict in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in addition to this, this report sets out a certain type of thinking which, as I see it, is damaging to this Parliament. It gives guidelines and attempts to export economic and cultural models to a region which is totally different, thereby continuing to abandon this region to the sphere of influence and interest of Russia, which wants to recreate a former Soviet Union. I believe that there is no place for this superficial type of approach, characterised by a lack of information and preconceptions, at least in our relations with Central Asia.</p>

They are fighting for better working conditions; they are fighting for an increase in pay due to the very harsh conditions they experience – which I saw for myself; they are fighting for the right to have independent trade unions; and they are calling for nationalisation, under workers’ control, of all enterprises in the oil extraction sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kazakhstan Government and the oil giant Kazmunaigaz have completely ignored the just demands of these workers and have effectively refused to engage in meaningful negotiations. Instead, the workers have been met with very severe and brutal repression. One trade unionist has been murdered; another worker’s daughter has been killed and their lawyer has been jailed for six years. Violence continues against these workers. Another strike activist returned to his home on 30 November to find his whole house and his car had been smashed up, and the police refused even to take a statement from him.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke to a group of workers last week who have launched an international appeal for the trade union movement to show solidarity with their struggle and have also called on the international leaders of the trade union movement to support the struggle of the workers to break the links with the leadership of the so-called Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Kazakhstan, which is completely pro-employer and pro-government. Tomorrow there will be major demonstrations in Kazakhstan and internationally in support of these workers. I will be standing alongside them in solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Efforts need to be stepped up to implement Nabucco. At the same time, I should mention the importance of launching other projects aimed at interconnecting energy and transport networks.

The economic crisis has led Member States to seek new ways to increase labour productivity. One way to do this, and to prolong the working lives of employees, is to invest properly in health and safety at work. Increased labour productivity and longer working lives, however, will both be impossible to achieve unless we take into consideration the human needs of employees. Well-being at work and labour productivity always go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there is already a realisation in many organisations that people’s heightened state of good physical and mental well-being reduces costs. There are fewer absences through illness and pension costs are lowered. This is also a matter, therefore, of economic realities.

I would like to emphasise three points that I consider particularly important. The first is paragraph 82, which we approved today. I would have preferred it if we had given an even clearer signal in regard to work-life balance, everything relating to occupational health and how we regulate work, the rhythm we provide workers with, including, above all, the protection of Sundays as a day of rest. I myself have launched an initiative in this regard and I believe we can all play our part in supporting March 3 next year as a Europe-wide day for Sunday as a day of rest.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe paragraph 16 is particularly important. After all, burnout is one of the illnesses that generates the highest costs in Europe. We urgently need a burnout strategy, and next year the European Commission is to publish a relevant study, as well as holding out the prospect of a Green Paper. This is something we urgently need to discuss in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the rapporteur for the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations 2012, I would like to make the following call: let us work together in Europe to ensure we respect everyone, both workers and employers alike, in health, vitality and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, Members of the European Parliament, call on the Commission to insist on the establishment of full financial and operational independence of the Control and Audit Office of Afghanistan. Moreover, the EP also urges the Commission to further strengthen coordination with Member States and the donor community in general. I want to stress that the own-initiative report of 15 January 2009 on the control of EU funds in Afghanistan had already asked the Commission to provide a comprehensive annual report including shortcomings identified and measures taken to remedy these shortcomings.

Afghanistan is amongst the recipient countries receiving the most civilian aid from the EU general budget. In the period 2002-2010 the combined EU (European Community and Member States) budget for aid to Afghanistan totalled around EUR 8 billion, but a significant proportion of the EU aid was lost along the distribution chain. The main reasons for this are: waste, excessive use of intermediaries, security costs, overbilling and corruption. I strongly believe that the EU must ensure transparency and accountability in relation to the financial assistance provided to the Afghan Government, international organisations and local NGOs, in order to ensure the coherence of aid and the success of Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until then, the EU, which supports more than 50% of Afghanistan’s foreign aid, will need to continue to have a budgetary appropriation available, not just to cover personnel costs, but also to fund all the projects that it has underway in this country. As such, the EU should continue to help the Afghan Government overcome this tragic situation and establish a fully democratic state; in other words, one with respect for minorities, for gender equality and for the values enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights.

This country is amongst the recipient countries receiving the most civilian aid from the EU general budget. It is of great concern that a large proportion of international aid goes astray in the distribution chain, in particular through waste, excessive intermediary and security costs, overbilling and corruption. It is therefore necessary for the Commission to supervise and monitor the cost and effectiveness of all EU aid to Afghanistan, with a view to ensuring that it is used more efficiently. The overall objective of EU development assistance to Afghanistan should be to assist in the long-term sustainable development of the country, including the improvement of socio-economic standards, facilitating job creation and the proliferation of small and medium-sized enterprises, strengthening the education sector and ensuring gender equality. Such aid should further facilitate capacity-building in public administration, strengthen the rule of law and reduce corruption, thus facilitating the transfer of responsibility for security to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. I believe that there is an urgent need to increase the efficiency of aid, as many development indicators still show no significant improvement, and corruption and the long distribution chain of international aid remain the principal obstacles to the provision of essential services to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These conflicts continue to exact a high price on Afghanistan and its people. Wars on the territory of Afghanistan were a characteristic of this country almost throughout the whole of the twentieth century. The terrorist attacks in 2001 and the presence of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan have meant that, unfortunately, nothing much has changed even now. Therefore, I fully agree with my colleague, Mr Geier, who has proposed direct assistance to Afghanistan from the EU budget, which is currently lacking. I firmly believe that, with strict financial controls on such funding and with experience, whether it comes from EU Member States or from our US partners, we will be able to arrive at a solution that really will help Afghanistan. I think that the most important area, apart from the independence of the judiciary – as pinpointed by Mr Geier – is to improve the situation in the field of education. Only in this way will it be possible to achieve sustainable development and to resolve the situation in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For these reasons we need to identify best practice in relation to expenditure. A cause for concern remains the issue of coordination of the aid.

With a plethora of international originations operating in theatre complementing the NATO ISAF mission, it is essential that partners coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication and therefore the needless squandering of resources. Of particular relevance here is the relationship between the EU and UN agencies and the direct EU budgetary support for Afghanistan, where there is a serious risk of duplication. The seemingly ubiquitous problems of government corruption, tribal nepotism, the hazardous security situation for EU officials as targets of the Taliban and poorly trained Afghan officials must be addressed with renewed vigour, and monitored closely. Audit bodies administering financial aid must be transparent and accountable. My hope is that EU financial assistance will assist in the creation of robust institutions and democratic mechanisms within Afghanistan in order that, following the 2014 withdrawal of foreign troops, Kabul can maintain internal security and adequate counter-insurgency capabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the report mentions, there is no single approach to which model of funding to use, as this depends in part on the objectives to be achieved.

The result of this evaluation was that enormous discrepancies were uncovered. In a comparative analysis of the administration of financing by the EU and US, the rapporteur refers to the benefits of major leverage and effective coordination of aid under the ‘Common Administration with International Organisations’ financing form, while also pointing to the need for negotiations on accountability and transparency as disadvantages. This analysis concludes that “direct budgetary aid to the Afghan national budget” should be chosen as the future method of providing aid, something I cannot agree with. Although the rapporteur recognises the problem of susceptibility to fraud and corruption, he seems to believe that there are sufficient safeguards in the clause permitting the discontinuation of budgetary aid to poorly performing administrative institutions. Accountability requirements are not sufficiently met and the actual aid in individual cases can be described as mediocre at best. It is not easy to redress the disadvantages of ‘Common Administration with International Organisations’: it should be stated clearly that NGOs that receive EU funds to administer must produce regular accountability reports to indicate clearly and unambiguously how much they have spent and where and these reports must also be published on the institutions’ websites. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that the Commission should take effective action to foster the global convergence of competition regulation. On energy policy, the Commission should actively monitor competition in energy markets and improve the integration of renewable sources of energy into energy networks. It is important that the Commission should step up efforts to open up competition in the credit rating agencies sector and ensure the quality of credit ratings. The Commission should determine whether differences in the application of public procurement rules in EU Member States lead to a distortion of competition.

The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Commission responded to the outbreak of the crisis in a prompt and reasonable manner by approving special State aid rules and using competition policy as a crisis management tool. Sizable amounts of state aid granted during the crisis in the form of, for example, guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and complementary forms of liquidity support on bank funding have contributed to severe imbalances in public finances. The Commission should continue to investigate the competition situation in the retail sector, in particular the consequences of alleged abuse of market power by dominant retail chains with negative consequences for small retailers and producers operating in the agricultural and food market. The European Parliament also takes the view that competition policy should contribute to the promotion and application of open standards and to ensuring interoperability in order to prevent the technological lock-in of consumers and clients by a minority of market players. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is noteworthy that, while the environment in which EU competition policy operates is undergoing profound changes such as rapid technological development, expansion or globalisation, time does not affect the various provisions of the 1957 Treaty that prohibit certain anti-competition agreements and abuse of a dominant position, and likewise does not affect the provisions on state aid, which testifies to their inherent ability to be applied in a variety of circumstances. Given the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission in the area of competition policy, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Commission is entitled to adopt detailed rules on how it intends to use its main instruments – the provisions of the Treaty relating to antitrust policy and provisions on mergers and state aid. Since implementation of the competition policy began, the EU has been characterised by two principal features in particular: its contribution to the building and maintenance of the internal market and its contribution to the interests of consumers. At the same time, the competition policy supports the main objectives of the European Union enshrined in the Treaties: a competitive market, economic, social and territorial cohesion and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For four decades, from the very beginnings of the creation of the Community, competition policy has been the essential basis for economic cooperation. Today we must also find a solution to the market movements distorted by the crisis, by using fair regulation. The Commission has attempted to react effectively to the economic crisis; it has approved rules on state aid while remaining within the framework of competition policy. I agree with the opinion of the rapporteurs, that we also need a global approach to competition regulations. The report addresses a number of sectors, which is why the call for a prompt implementation of the internal energy market package is justified, in order to create an open and competitive single energy market. The introduction of effective cost analysis in all phases of the food supply chain is equally important for consumer interest protection. The Commission’s guidelines aimed at rescuing and restructuring the banking sector are also unavoidable, and the observance and application of these guidelines will have to be monitored. I agree with linking future temporary state aid for the banking sector to stricter conditions; furthermore, appropriate attention should be paid to a more ethical consumer credit provision. The market distortions created by the crisis can only be resolved through joint EU action. I voted for the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as in my opinion competition policy is a key factor in developing the EU into a dynamic, efficient and innovative internal market and in strengthening its competitiveness on the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the opinion that protectionism and the non-enforcement of competition rules will not contribute to solving the crisis in any way. On the contrary, a properly conceived competition policy should help to build a dynamic and innovative internal market that will successfully face global competition. Even in times of crisis, cartel agreements remain the most serious threat to competition, consumer welfare and the proper functioning of markets, and therefore it is justified to impose fines as a tool for enforcing the applicable laws. I believe, however, that the Commission should examine individual cases with special care and ensure that the amounts of fines imposed do not irreparably jeopardise the economic viability of the enterprise concerned, which would lead to its bankruptcy, liquidation and, consequently, large job losses. The crisis situation means that the responses to the challenges arising must take into account the complex economic and social context and must not penalise EU citizens even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund grants support to and helps reintegrate in the labour market workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation and as a direct effect of the global financial and economic crisis. In October 2009, France submitted an application and requested assistance in respect of 4 445 redundancies (of which 3 582 are targeted for assistance) in the enterprise Renault s.a.s. and seven of its suppliers from the automotive industry. Since 2008, Renault has been severely affected by the increasing cost of credit and the hardening of credit conditions resulting from the global financial and economic crisis. As a result, demand for Renault cars dropped and the enterprise’s economic situation worsened. According to the Commission’s assessment, the application fulfils the eligibility criteria set out in the EGF Regulation. I agree to the EGF being mobilised to provide a financial contribution for the application submitted by France in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant due to the global financial and economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The workers made redundant by Renault in France should be given financial assistance. I should stress that the procedure for releasing the grants needs to be speeded up. The efficiency and transparency in awarding them are of paramount importance. I think that the cofinancing rate through the EGF of 65% must not be reduced. I should mention that in September Nokia decided to relocate its business from Romania to Asia. As a result, more than 2 200 workers are due to be made redundant from January 2012.

Today’s vote was, controversy aside, a vote for or against the EGF. As we work on extending this fund beyond 2013 – which, it should be pointed out, is one of the EU’s only concrete actions to tackle the social consequences of the crisis – it seemed important to me to express my support for the EGF. It certainly appears that, in Renault’s case, not all the rules have been fully respected (funding of so-called passive training rather than active training) and that the French company has shown a certain reluctance to provide the information it was asked for. It is therefore vital to find a solution for the workers who now find themselves in difficulty. In the long term, this French case shows us that we need to improve management of the EGF in the forthcoming budgetary period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the economic crisis, Renault is still making large profits; however, it has been using money from the national and European budgets for years for the purpose of mass redundancies. It hopes to do likewise in this particular instance, for 3 000 workers, without using its own funds or profits for the bonuses and ‘social plan’ which are compulsory under French law. As the French trade unions have complained, for years Renault has done nothing to defend the rights of workers or to maintain jobs. </p>

Unfortunately, the satisfaction of the application was made more complicated by the fact that the employees who had been made redundant chose an early retirement plan, which resulted in a conflict with present European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) regulations. The pension rights of people who have been made redundant, however, changed during the pension reform, and it was bona fide employees who suffered. I do, however, recognise the efforts made by the French Government and all parties to solve the situation, and I nevertheless consider it appropriate for Renault’s application to be financed from EGF funds. I consider the existence of this fund to be very important, as it offers extensive support to those who have been made redundant as a result of the economic crisis in finding new jobs through retraining. Hopefully those Member States that have not yet received support from the fund due to high cost-sharing or insufficient administrative capacity, will also receive support from the EGF. One positive example, however, is Holland, which has set the objective of taking maximum advantage of European Union subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Redundancies at Renault in France, while very unfortunate for the workers, have nothing to do with “globalisation” and everything to do with corporate policy. The Renault Group is not in economic difficulties and, if business is slow in some markets, this is due to internal problems within the company relating to service and the delivery of new cars. In addition, Renault has also moved production capacity to ‘Dacia’ because it can produce more cheaply in Romania, and is planning significant foreign investment (for example in Brazil). If French workers lose their jobs as a result, I do not see this as a reason to reward this conglomerate with approximately EUR 25 million from the European budget, instead of being called to account by the French State for its share in providing social cover for its former workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is still suffering from its decisions not being understood by its citizens, who still feel detached from them. The challenge of bringing Europe and its citizens closer together is more relevant than ever: guaranteeing transparency of the decisions issued by the EU as well as free access to the documents of the three institutions is vital if we want to rise to the challenge. The European Parliament is already an open and transparent institution that widely publishes its meetings and reports. Indeed, it is thanks to more transparency that citizens can take part in the democratic process with full knowledge of the facts. I therefore voted in favour of this report, which seeks to strengthen public access to documents and democracy in the European Union. This opening up of access to documents in particular gives national political stakeholders the chance to check the acts of the European institutions, and it integrates all content whatever its medium concerning a matter falling within the sphere of responsibility of a Union institution. We can thus make progress towards transparency with the aim of clarifying the opacity of ‘Brussels’ decisions for all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transparency, which is an expression of the right to good administration, also represents an excellent tool for its control. Extending the definition of a document to include any electronic media may make it significantly easier to access them. The practice of broadcasting Parliament’s plenary sessions and committee meetings online is a good example of transparency and openness of activities. The Commission should also give a clear indication of its willingness to ensure greater transparency in the functioning of the EU’s institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Various restrictions on access to documents, including while they are being drafted, may equate to a blocking of public information. The decision to refuse access to a document should therefore be made on the basis of clearly and precisely formulated rules, which also set out special exceptions.

<p class="contents">First of all, it must be highlighted that public access to EU documents increases the level of transparency of the EU institutions, with the upshot of a higher level of public confidence and a sense of closeness to the EU. I am pleased to see that the report contained a number of ambitious amendments to the Commission’s proposal. The suggestions made offer citizens wider access compared with the Commission’s text, which ignores some aspects of the jurisprudence of the CJEU (for example, in the Turco v. Council case). Secondly, the definition chosen for ‘documents’ is much more suitable than the Commission’s definition. Third-party documents held by institutions must be accessible under the current system which has worked fairly well. I also support the document classification system proposed by the rapporteur and I think that it is adequate for maintaining the level of protection required to ensure the smooth operation of EU institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an example of democracy in action, the European Union felt the need to demonstrate to its citizens that it has nothing to hide, so it adopted its first regulation on transparency 10 years ago. This report, drafted by Mr Cashman, concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission regarding public access to the documents of the EU institutions. Access to information and the documents of public bodies – while it can be embarrassing at times – is a fundamental right of the public and should be treated as such. Nevertheless, there is a need to safeguard a level of confidentiality on certain subjects, both for personal and copyright reasons, and to prevent those with privileged access to certain information from making improper use of it.</p>

The principles and limits governing this right of access have been determined by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, which became applicable on 3 December 2001. However, as a number of substantive changes have been made to the regulation, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and better comprehensibility. Transparency in the legislative process is of utmost importance for citizens. Therefore, institutions should actively disseminate documents that are part of the legislative process, and dissemination should also be encouraged in other areas. On account of the highly sensitive content of certain documents, it should be borne in mind under all circumstances that they should be treated in a special and responsible manner.</p>

Citizens have a right to know that not only the European Commission and Parliament but also the Council of Ministers are accountable to them. At times, there is an unfair perception that important decisions are simply taken in Brussels and then ‘imposed’ on national governments. Making clear how ministers and prime ministers vote in the Council will allow citizens to be better informed about how decisions are made on EU policies that affect them. The report should also be welcomed because it clarifies rules and imposes limits on which EU documents can be classified. Parliament inserted a rule stating that EU documents can only be classified where their disclosure would undermine the essential interests of the EU or one of its Member States, most notably on public security and defence matters. My hope is that we can now have constructive negotiations with the Council and Commission to reach an agreement and enhance the EU’s accountability and credibility with citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Administrative processes and decisions, including those relating to personnel issues, should be published. The same applies to the protection of trade secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court proceedings and competition procedures. The report contains definitions that are vague, lack clarity and cast their net too widely. Any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU is defined as a document. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. The publication of information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, enables public access to the procedure. This would open up the possibility of external influence. Lobbyists would have direct access to the legislative process. This report does not benefit our citizens.

The rapporteur, Mr Cashman, was also responsible for the proposal for revision of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. There he put forward some crucial modifications to the European Commission’s proposal presented on 30 April 2008. The European Parliament voted on and supported those on 11 March 2009. After the EP’s election in June 2009 Mr Cashman was reappointed as rapporteur on the dossier. On 1 December the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and to a large extent modified the legal framework for the revision of this regulation. Already in 2006 he drafted the resolution of the European Parliament approved overwhelmingly by MEPs, containing a list of recommendations for improvement of the current regulation. In this perspective, when the Commission presented its proposal for revision in 2008, expectations were very high as to how the standards on public access to EU documents could be improved. However, despite some positive modifications inserted in the proposal which are clearly justifiable, like the extension of the beneficiaries of this regulation, and conformity with the Aarhus Convention, others would, in my view, represent a step backwards for transparency, especially if we consider that most of the European Parliament’s requests of 2006 have not been taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bureaucratic procedures and decisions, which also comprise aspects regarding the staff, will be published. The same goes for intellectual property, business secrets and sensitive information in the context of admission procedures, trials and competition proceedings. The report provides woolly and vague definitions. Documents are taken to mean any data or content connected in any way with the EU’s policies, measures or decisions of the bodies and institutions. This also broadly includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents as well as all related information. Hence the definition comprises not only documents but also information. The publication of information about ongoing interinstitutional proceedings, e.g. informal trialogue negotiations, creates a public access to the procedure. This would open those negotiations to direct influence from outside, e.g. through lobbying. The report is not in the interests of our citizens.

However, we note in many Member States the inability to satisfactorily deal with the problem of waste management. In recent years, waste management has become a social problem of the utmost importance. The difficulty of managing these issues has negative effects not only on human health and well-being, but also on the environment in the broader sense. Although the Union adopted draft legislation to guarantee a suitable legal framework to deal with the problem, analysis of waste management policies yields conflicting information. Some Member States, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, are very advanced, while other EU countries have been very slow to implement strategies on waste, which has led to serious breaches of European legislation. It is clear to me that we need urgently to implement a consistent policy on waste management in Europe. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that the Commission’s proposal to establish a more proactive waste management monitoring procedure together with an early warning system in the area of compliance is a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EMSA also provides Member States and the European Commission with scientific and technical assistance so that they are able to apply Community legislation. The activities of this agency are important because it has, since its inception, conducted more than 100 investigations of various kinds relating to safety, security and the prevention of pollution from ships.

The European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation 1406/2002 on 27 June 2002. The regulation came into effect in August of the same year, while EMSA started operating in March 2003. In accordance with Article 22 of that regulation, its Administrative Board commissioned an independent external evaluation on the implementation of the regulation in 2007. Based on this evaluation, it issued recommendations regarding changes to the regulation, to the Agency and its working practices in June 2008. Certain provisions need to be clarified and updated and, in addition, EMSA should be given a number of further roles reflecting the development of maritime safety policy at EU and international levels. The extraction of oil and gas and offshore production activities pose risks to maritime transport and the marine environment. For this reason, it is important that the Agency, within its capabilities, makes the necessary efforts to minimise similar risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the eight years, it has operated, EMSA has done effective work in the area of both maritime safety and maritime pollution. It is an efficient and well-managed organisation. As mentioned above, the EMSA mandate will be broadened, offering an opportunity to shape the common maritime area and common market, using both a so-called blue zone pilot project and also satellite monitoring systems. The EMSA will also be assigned an important role in the training and raising of the qualifications of European Union seamen, and also in making the seaman’s profession more attractive. The third important additional role is the monitoring of gas and petroleum installations. I consider the EMSA’s coordinative role, which makes it possible to utilise member states’ maritime safety resources and skills more rationally, to be vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Concerning EMSA’s competence with regard to satellite technology — GMES — I would like to underline that, given the considerable national resources invested and the satellite systems currently in orbit, governance of the European satellite systems is a sensitive issue. Therefore I do not believe that it is appropriate to extend the Agency’s competence to include the governance of space resources. In view of the significance in terms of international politics and the security of maritime governance (especially the southern maritime border of the EU), I think that the role of Member States with regard to EMSA’s governance should be safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although EMSA must focus on its priority tasks in the area of maritime safety, the Agency should also receive a number of additional tasks reflecting the development of the maritime safety policy at EU and international level.

Where these systems can be deployed to support other policy objectives, this offers Member States savings on their national budgets and represents genuine European added value.

In my opinion, however, we should amend the legislation as little as possible. Secondly, the aim of the proposed amendments to the Regulation is to expand the tasks of EMSA. I, however, consider the proposed set of tasks for the Agency to be too wide, and it seems to me that the proposed Regulation lacks a clear specification of competences. Thirdly, I have concerns over setting the budget.

We need to be realistic and only ask the Agency to do what it is able, particularly at a time of budgetary cuts. It should remain the rightful organisation for guaranteeing security and safety in EU maritime areas. In my view, the Agency should be responsible for preventing any cause of pollution and have adequate means to do so, and to tackle its disastrous effects for the environment and human health, offshore and onshore. Originally created to prevent disasters like the loss of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> being repeated, the Agency is fundamental to the protection of our seas. I shall remain vigilant to ensure that its action is both useful and effective and that it can take action in coordination with the Member States. The seas are fragile ecosystems, overexploited spaces, where dangerous or illegal activities take place. It is up to us to protect them, by giving ourselves the means to preserve them.

However, President Bashar al-Assad and his regime, despite all the condemnations made by the EU and various international institutions, in particular the Arab League, insist on ‘riding out’ a totalitarian regime that does not respect a bare minimum of human rights. Indeed, there are reports of persecution of doctors simply for having treated victims of the regime, and of blocking access to detainees and the entry of humanitarian aid to a population whose situation is worsening because of the cuts in the electricity and water supplies. The brutal repression of thousands of civilians is unleashing an arms race. Civil war and the massacre of the population are feared. There is therefore an urgent need for the Syrian regime to stop the violence and accept the constitution of a single platform, with the participation of the regime’s opponents, so as to prepare the transition to democracy.</p>

An increasing number of Syrians are facing a deteriorating humanitarian situation that is leading to a humanitarian crisis, systematically increasing violence, and violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is essential that the Syrian authorities and military and security forces immediately cease all acts of violence, torture, persecution and repression against the civilian population and immediately release all political prisoners held in arbitrary detention.

<p class="contents">The series of events known as the Arab Spring has shown that people in the Arab countries do not in fact support a situation in which the leaders have no democratic mandate. The way of thinking in the West during the Cold War, where dictators were tolerated, if not even favoured, if it only suited the political aims of one’s own camp, was so deeply rooted, that the speed of events came as a surprise to Western countries used to realpolitik. If Muammar Gaddafi had succeeded in quashing the revolution in Libya when it began, it would inevitably have been followed by large-scale and thorough acts of revenge against the civilian population. There is a real danger that something similar will happen in Syria, if foreign pressure eases off and those currently in power re-establish their position.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, from the historical point of view, economic sanctions alone have only worked in a handful of cases in modern times, and, on the whole, have mainly targeted that section of the population whose interests one is trying to promote. We therefore have to prepare for the possibility that military intervention is unavoidable. After all, Turkey has already unilaterally established a security zone close to its border, which the international community has, at least implicitly, approved.</p>
<p class="contents">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which freed the people of Libya, was epoch-making. With it, Europe adopted a long-term, real initiative in global policy.

This resolution asserts its support of the Syrian people and strongly condemns Bachar al-Assad’s regime, but remains relatively vague with regard to measures that could be taken by the EU or the international community. In particular, the resolution calls for ‘the sending of international observers to deter attacks against civilians’ and ‘to find new ways of strengthening their non-military assistance to these opposition forces’. The vaguest paragraph concerns the UN Security Council and says that it has not been able to respond to the events in Syria (that is quite true but whose fault is it?) and that it now must assume its responsibility (let us suppose), but without specifying how. I therefore preferred to abstain from voting on this resolution. I welcome, however, the awarding of the Sakharov prize this week to Razan Zaitouneh (Syrian human rights lawyer) and to Ali Farzat (Syrian cartoonist), which is a powerful symbol of Parliament’s support of the Syrian people’s struggle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left considers that this particular economic governance package is the wrong response to the crisis. Its objective is not economic coordination, as it maintains; it is to impose a permanent austerity memorandum throughout Europe, on all the workers. It is clear from the results of the scoreboard in question that convergence is being translated into an increase in competitiveness, by institutionalising austerity and making cutbacks to wages, pensions and rights. Indicators relating to income imbalances and the reduction in poverty are missing from the scoreboard and the unemployment indicator has very little weighting. The euro area is dealing with massive structural problems that are creating imbalances that are being shouldered mainly by the workers both in the countries in surplus and in the countries in deficit. As the economic governance package – and hence the scoreboard of macroeconomic imbalances – cannot provide fair and radical solutions in terms of getting the euro area out of the crisis and ensuring that it functions viably, I voted against this specific motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, in order to ensure the problems and the solutions to be implemented are correctly identified, a macroeconomic framework is essential for the whole Union.

On 16 November 2011, Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances was adopted, as part of a series of regulations on economic governance. This motion for a resolution follows the question for oral answer, pursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure, and is based on the Commission services working paper entitled ‘Scoreboard for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances: envisaged initial design’. In order to prevent certain Member States from experiencing further financial slippages which could lead to a new crisis, and in line with the proposals of the ‘six pack’, there will be ‘macroeconomic surveillance’, with a focus on countries with current account deficits and surpluses. I am therefore voting for this motion for a resolution, since I believe there should be greater rigour in the management of public money, so that the markets – particularly the financial markets – will regain the confidence that they have lost, and the EU will eventually be able to take up a position of leadership in terms of economic growth and job creation, thus working towards the goals outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Besides this, of course, it is also important for the Commission to take into account the most up-to-date data available and to ensure complete transparency with regard to what data is being used. It should also be emphasised that it is important for the new macroeconomic imbalance surveillance mechanism to be harmonised and integrated with the upcoming European semester. However, we should not forget either that the scoreboard plays an important role in relaying information, as the selection of indicators sends a clear attitude-forming message to political decision-makers and stakeholders about the types of macroeconomic developments that may give cause for concern and therefore need close supervision.

In order to ensure that this legislative package can function as effectively as possible, an appropriate set of macroeconomic indicators need to be identified, as well as associated alert levels which would trigger the application of preventive and corrective mechanisms. These mechanisms would guarantee the possibility of an early detection of external and internal imbalances in the economies of the Member States and enable the European Commission to respond appropriately. The European Parliament’s resolution is a response to the European Commission’s proposal for such indicators, and points to the areas where the Commission's proposal can be improved. Particular attention should be paid to the failure to take adequate account of spillover effects and the dynamics of the unemployment rate. It should also be noted that the European Parliament has not been consulted on this matter, so that the motion for a resolution drawn up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the only effective way for Parliament’s to be heard on this issue.

This procedure is based on a punitive approach that is unacceptable. In this case, it is all the more unfair as it penalises trade deficits, but the same does not happen with surpluses, which can be just as harmful to the overall economic interests of the Union.

This White Paper, adopted by the European Commission in March 2011, sets out a detailed strategy for the development of a competitive transport system and key objectives to be achieved by 2050. I support Parliament’s opinion that the EU’s high degree of dependence on imported fossil fuels entails significant risks in terms of the Union’s economic security and in terms of the flexibility of its external policy options. I believe that it is necessary to ensure the successful development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), effectively link the transport networks of all EU regions and eliminate disparities between the levels of infrastructure development in the EU Member States. I agree that Member States should commit themselves to eliminating the main known bottlenecks in every transport mode and to ensuring that, by 2025, the transport infrastructure of the new Member States reaches the level of the other Member States. The Commission should increase the stability of funding of TEN-T projects. EU cofunding should be based on the “use it or lose it” principle. We must take decisive action to clearly formulate, develop and implement the future goals of an effective and competitive EU transport policy. As the goals of the previous 2001 White Paper were implemented only partially or not at all, we must properly analyse and learn from previous mistakes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the approach that should be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a key point determined my final vote. At the vote on recasting the directives on the rail sector during the last plenary session, I was opposed to the idea of asking the European Commission to make proposals in 2012 to separate infrastructure management and transport operations as well as to open up the internal passenger rail transport market. This idea was restated in the Grosch report. I believe, however, that, despite the fact that it was adopted in November in the previous report, it is still a bad idea. I therefore voted against this own-initiative report, which also contained provisions aiming to promote the circulation of ‘gigaliners’ as they are called, the ecological benefit of which is debatable, to say the least! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the report’s unquestioning support for the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) project is a problem. More and more critical issues are continuing to emerge with regard to this project, which involves the construction of trans-European rail, motorway and river networks. It is an immensely ambitious project, and there are concerns about its feasibility, from the point of view of both finance and planning, as the slow and uncertain progress thus far has shown. As <span class="italic">Lega Nord </span>has always maintained, our region does not need grandiose projects that are impossible to bring to fruition, but greater attention to its actual, immediate needs.

The transport sector is particularly important and has great potential to develop and deliver innovation in areas such as transport, logistics and mobility. EU transport can also play a role in other areas, such as innovation, research, the environment, sustainable economic growth and energy. This sector can also make a major contribution to achieving the goals of the EU’s “Europe 2020” economic growth strategy. Taking into account economic, employment, environmental, social and territorial aspects, the aim should be to complete the European internal transport market by further opening-up transport networks and markets. The European Commission should ensure that proposals on the opening-up of services in all transport markets do not lead to social dumping or poorer quality services, or create the conditions for the emergence of monopolies or oligopolies. In order to address properly the problems of transport and mobility, in particular those arising in urban areas, an integrated transport policy for the entire transport and logistics value chain is needed. Coordination of the work of policy-makers in the European institutions should be enhanced and there should also be permanent dialogue and consultation with representatives of the logistics industry, transport service providers and customers in a European logistics and mobility forum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of a Single European Transport Area is therefore a link to regional, environmental, social, economic and employment policy.

It is of crucial importance for the internal market and the living standards of citizens, enabling them to travel freely, and it aids economic growth and job creation. However, it must be sustainable in the light of the new challenges facing society. Since it is global in nature, the effectiveness of individual actions requires strong international cooperation. The future prosperity of the European continent will depend on the ability of all of its regions to maintain full and competitive integration in the global economy. Efficient transport plays a very important role in meeting this objective. There are still obstacles to the smooth functioning of effective competition in the internal market. A goal of the coming decades should therefore be to create a genuine Single European Transport Area by removing all remaining barriers between the individual modes of transport and national systems.

I believe that the transport sector offers significant potential for supporting the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy in areas such as sustainable economic growth, innovation and energy. In this regard, I share the view that more robust support is required for the development of the infrastructure in the new Member States, which would help narrow the differences in the development of individual regions and achieve a Single European Transport Area. Intermodality is also important to increasing the sector’s efficiency, as the various forms of transport should complement each other. Another key aspect is the importance of coordination among the individual policies and the various stakeholders, as macro-regional strategies can also have a not insignificant role to play in this. Climate change, switching transport to alternative and renewable energy sources, safety and providing an infrastructure that is accessible to people with disabilities are just some of the challenges facing the sector for which comprehensive solutions should be proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such demands in the current uncertain period may deal a fatal blow to the European economy and its global competitiveness. The transport sector makes a significant contribution to competitiveness and growth in Europe, and we should therefore support and not hinder it. I therefore consider it important to complete the European internal transport market by opening further transport networks and markets. I therefore support the proposal to stabilise the funding of construction of a Trans-European Transport Network, and I particularly applaud the proposal to include EuroVelo, the European long-distance network of cycle paths, in the Trans-European Transport Network. I generally consider this a good report, but I am concerned about the Trojan Horse that was unfortunately smuggled into it in the form of unrealistic environmental targets for reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in transport, implementation of which would harm European competitiveness. As I do not consider it a good thing for the many good steps proposed in the report not to be implemented on account of the Trojan Horse, I have given the report only conditional support.

In order to address these problems, towns should establish sustainable mobility plans, and financial support for projects should be made dependent upon the submission of such plans. Under the principle of subsidiarity, towns will, of course, decide themselves what urban projects to plan, but these projects will have to comply with the standards of European transport policy, meaning that they will have to provide for efficient multi-modal passenger and goods logistics chains which reduce not only traffic in towns but also environmental impact. For this reason, mobility plans will also have to provide for increased infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists and lead to the doubling of the number of public transport users.

Transport is very important for EU citizens because it defines mobility. EU citizens are the beneficiaries of the European transport area, as it helps them to be mobile in all situations in daily life, allowing them to benefit from their right to free movement across Europe for professional and private purposes. On average, 13.2% of the budget of private households is spent on transport goods and services. Furthermore, passenger and goods transport provides jobs for many Europeans and serves the completion of the European internal market, as it accounts for some 5% of EU wealth (in terms of GDP) and employs over 10 million Europeans. Transport is an important factor for towns and regions, as it not only connects towns and regions but also contributes to the EU’s status as a research and innovation centre and is therefore an important factor for the development of the EU and its regions, with immediate influence on the social cohesion of the regions. The creation of a Single European Transport Area as a goal of the future European transport policy is thus directly linked to regional, environmental, economic, social, and employment policy. Owing to this link, the transport sector can make a significant contribution to the EU 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European transport sector has reached a crossroads. Old problems are still unresolved, and new problems have already arisen. The internal market for transport is not yet completely developed, and solutions must be found to the questions of how to better fulfil residents’ travel desires and satisfy the economy’s freight transport needs while resource and environmental requirements are becoming more stringent. The transport systems of Eastern and Western Europe must be integrated in such a manner that they reflect the transport needs of our entire continent and its 500 million inhabitants. Although transport has become more energy-efficient, in the EU 96% of its energy needs still depend on petroleum and petroleum products. Transport has indeed become more environmentally sustainable, but due to increased volumes it is still the main source of noise and local air pollution. Environmental restrictions are often portrayed in the transport sector as a constraining issue that create expenses, but one must look farther into the future – these restrictions serve as an engine of innovation and improvement, and are also accompanied by a better living environment for our citizens. And of course efficient transport is also a precondition for fuller and more competitive participation in the global economy, upon which Europe’s future prosperity depends. At the same time, member states underestimate the added value of transport policy for Europe, and often inhibit it by implementing directives imprecisely or belatedly. I supported this report, as I sincerely hope that this report will help us move in the desired direction and guarantee the functioning of the transport system that is so essential to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress made towards achieving the submitted aims should be assessed annually, so as to have an understanding of possible failings in advance and to tailor measures to the situation of each Member State. The transport sector is an area that interacts with all European policy. Implementation of the single market and free movement of goods and people will only be fully realised once there is a network of infrastructure and transport services. However, the strategy must take into account the different situations of the Member States and the European regions themselves. As such, investment in modes of transport should take into account the specificities of each region.</p>
<p class="contents">The outermost regions, given their geographical and morphological characteristics, are far removed from the European internal market. Investment in maritime transport and regional airports is key to their full integration.

Passenger transport is expected to increase by about 34%. The various forms of transport should therefore not compete with each other, but complement each another effectively.

Shortcomings such as prison overcrowding and the alleged mistreatment of detainees may jeopardise the trust that must underpin judicial cooperation in criminal matters based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other judicial rulings of the EU Member States. Compliance with standards in the area of fundamental rights and the necessary convergence of the rights of suspects and accused persons and procedural rights in criminal proceedings is crucial for ensuring mutual trust between Member States in the area of freedom, security and justice. Conditions of detention are of particular importance to the application of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial rulings in the area of freedom, security and justice. On the other hand, however, I consider it equally important for Member States to allocate adequate funds for the restructuring and modernisation of prison facilities and for the protection of the rights of detainees, their successful rehabilitation, and preparation for their release and integration into society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, detention conditions in the European Union are regularly condemned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg. The latest condemnation came in a ruling on 20 January 2011, in which the ECtHR once again pointed the finger at French prison conditions for violation of Article 3 (the prohibition of the use of inhuman or degrading treatment). Europe’s prisons therefore suffer from many problems. Human rights are abused, there is a denial of dignity for detained persons and so on.

The text points the finger at the failure of many Member States of the European Union to comply with European regulations on detention, resulting in prison overcrowding, a high number of suicides and much physical and mental suffering. The resolution also requires the Commission and the Council to recognise certain categories of detainees as being particularly vulnerable, including children and illegal immigrants, and to transform this recognition into rights. The European Union, as the champion of respect for human rights, can only gain if it ensures that its own fundamental rights are respected, even in our prisons.

In fact many accusations of forced labour have been made, in particular accusations of child labour in Uzbekistan's cotton production sector. I therefore voted for a suspension of the approval procedure so that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) can carry out new investigations into the real situation regarding forced child labour in this country.

The PCA in force between the EU and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the other, does not include the trade of textile products, which were covered by a bilateral agreement that expired in 2005. A protocol to the PCA intended to include the bilateral trade of textile products is currently in its final stages. When establishing agreements and partnerships, the EU includes binding clauses – Article 2 of the EU-Uzbekistan PCA – on ‘respect for democracy, principles of international law and human rights’. As the EU imports up to 23% of Uzbekistan’s cotton and is the country’s main customer, it is essential that we use all the means at our disposal to help it on its way to democracy and to abandoning inhumane practices such as using child labour. I voted for this resolution for this reason, and I hope that the children of Uzbekistan will soon be able to devote themselves exclusively to study and will no longer be forced to go and work in the cotton fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the EU had a bilateral agreement with Uzbekistan, it decided to include Article 16 in the partnership and cooperation agreement, explicitly excluding textiles from the agreement. For other sectors, the partnership and cooperation agreement provided for mutual most favoured nation status. In economic terms, however, this agreement should not be overestimated. Uzbekistan is the world’s fifth-largest producer of cotton and its third-biggest cotton exporter. In Uzbekistan, the political and economic systems are under state control. Although cotton is produced on private farms, the harvested cotton must be handed over to state-owned firms for a price dictated by the state. Moreover, government employees mobilise children as a cheap source of labour during the cotton harvest and send them out into the cotton fields. Schools are closed during the harvest period. Over the years, many international organisations have expressed concerns regarding the use of forced child labour in Uzbekistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is necessary to insist that the Uzbek Government comprehensively implements the formal prohibition of this practice in Uzbek legislation and the international conventions.

This protocol sets out to include textiles in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, whereby the two parties grant each other most-favoured-nation status, thus putting an end to the legal uncertainty for exporters. On the basis of the principles and goals of the Union’s external actions, the Union, as one of the main trading partners and largest importer of cotton from Uzbekistan, has, I believe, a moral obligation to use its leverage to stop forced child labour in this country.

My position is that no consent can be given to the Protocol until after the ILO had been granted access to Uzbekistan and child labour has effectively been eradicated. Another amendment that I tabled concerned the reforms in the agricultural sector which need to be done in the interest of the Uzbek population and the need to introduce high-level labour, social and ecological standards.

At present, the main issue on the table is that of deepening cooperation, particularly with regard to trade in textiles. Uzbekistan is the third-largest exporter of cotton in the world. It is in the harvesting of cotton that we encounter the biggest obstacle. The issue of forced child labour in cotton harvesting is a topic that has still not been resolved. Uzbekistan has made significant progress in combating this problem in recent years, and UNICEF observers have noted and appreciated these changes and reforms, but unfortunately this is still not enough. One of the last measures that Uzbekistan must carry out is to permit monitoring by observers of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). I have personally visited Uzbekistan several times and have seen that the country is willing to cooperate in this area and is interested in ensuring the complete cessation of forced child labour. I therefore call upon our Uzbek partners to allow access to ILO personnel, so that we can finally move forward. I firmly believe that together we will find the path to agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The allegations against Uzbekistan that it uses forced child labour are serious, and an investigation into the situation by the International Labour Organisation would be beneficial, but long standing traditions that see a school-aged voluntary work-force put to work each year to collect cotton during the harvest, must also be taken into account. Following this we could then consider the potential advantages and disadvantages that could be brought to the situation by the temporary withdrawal of GSP status for Uzbek cotton imported to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, Member States which wish to extend the restrictions on citizens of those countries to entering the labour market must provide specific, detailed and appropriately justified reasons for any such extension. They must also clearly indicate what risks and labour market disruptions have arisen in their country because, if the reports of other Member States and the Commission are anything to go by, Bulgarian and Romanian workers have only a positive impact on the economy and have not caused any harm to the labour market.

Yet two Member States face obstacles regarding the right to work in another Member State. The free movement of workers is a positive socioeconomic example for the EU and the Member States, a milestone in the process of EU integration and economic development and a counterweight to the negative effects of economic crisis, and contributes to the creation of a stronger economic power that is prepared to face the challenges associated with global changes. Member States that did not implement transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of workers from Member States that acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007 do not report any negative consequences. Many Member States have, however, decided to continue to apply restrictions in their labour markets (with regard to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals), which stem more from political pressures than well-founded negative impacts on their economy and labour market. I think it is necessary to repeal the restrictive transitional periods to allow Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to enjoy the right of equal treatment enshrined in the Treaties, thus ensuring fair competition between businesses and avoiding social and economic dumping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination at EU level is in the interest of every European worker, and, at the same time, it is also the key to the implementation of real workforce mobility. It should be stressed that the expected immigration wave did not take place, the actual data do not even come close to the forecasts. The number of workers appearing on the Western European labour market since May this year, when the restrictions imposed on the citizens of Central and Eastern European countries that acceded to the European Union in 2004 were completely lifted, was significantly lower than expected.

Following this logic, the states which are imposing restrictions will attempt to extend them, thereby turning them into electoral instruments. The European Union should take bolder action, especially in the current economic situation. We are in economic deadlock because the European perception of many Member States is in a state of deadlock, and many European governments have abandoned their pro-European statements under the pressure of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we have been having such a lively debate on this subject in the European Parliament. I hope that the upshot of the two resolutions adopted this year will be the lifting of the labour market restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians. I would like to end by mentioning that the decline in economic activity does not exclude the need for growth. Romanian workers are excluded by austerity, but are in demand where any serious growth plan is involved. For example, a Romanian bricklayer can lay around 5 000 bricks a day in London. British construction companies have noticed the difference and prefer Romanians as it is more difficult to find British bricklayers, and they do not have the same output. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every day, I support the free movement of workers in accordance with the EU Treaties as a member of the European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, the unprecedented crisis that we are currently experiencing and the significantly high unemployment levels, affecting young people in particular, force us to target all of our efforts at national level to get our citizens back on the path to employment. As permanent rapporteur on the European Social Fund (ESF) in the 27 Member States, I am firmly committed to supporting European citizens’ integration into the labour market to help them achieve social integration.

After joining the European Union in 2004, the Eastern European governments were disgruntled to find their citizens denied the fundamental right of free movement for workers by some of the older Member States by means of exception clauses in the accession treaties. Now our eastern neighbours are doing all they can to encourage well-trained workers to stay at home. It no longer makes sense to continue to exclude even workers with lower qualifications, particularly in Germany, where unemployment is still in decline. The figures show that people from the ‘new’ Member States only account for about 0.7% of the workforce of the ‘older’ Member States. In contrast, people from non-EU states make up around 5% of the EU population of working age – a much higher proportion. Naturally, the situation varies from Member State to Member State. In Germany, the figures are 1% from the ‘new’ Member States and 7% from non-EU states. Experience elsewhere shows that the economy will benefit from free movement for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">According to new calculations, economic growth in Ireland in recent years would have been about 0.4% lower without such movement.

Now is a good time to summarise what has been achieved by the EU’s strategy for this region, since it has been in operation for four years. It is particularly encouraging to see the regularity of meetings and the strengthening of relationships between high-level representatives, particularly in the face of major events such as the global crisis. At the same time, there are only three EU representations in these countries, which is concerning, and I am therefore pinning great hopes on the proposal to create a regional interparliamentary forum. Another important consideration is the need to increase the EU funds available to implement programmes in this region. This also entails the development of an appropriate strategy for their absorption.

Given the financial constraints, the focus should be on those medium- and long-term programmes that may have the biggest impact on the development of the region, notably youth and education, technical assistance to support economic development and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as ensuring water security and combating drug trafficking.

The EU can make a more effective contribution to organising and consolidating civil society in the five countries targeted by the report. I positively note the interest shown in the report in supporting measures targeting the sustainable development of the economies in these countries which have suffered terribly in the aftermath of the collapse of the former USSR. I notice the attention focused on the actions for actively tackling poverty in the region, a scourge providing the basis for the development of social violence, religious fanaticism and even terrorist actions.

This is a very important region for EU foreign policy that, if driven away, could hand geostrategic dominance to Russia and China. Despite problems such as the high level of poverty and drug production, which is often linked to human rights violations, it is a region rich in natural resources and could diversify supply routes, so playing a key role in increasing trade. The EU should therefore review its strategy for the countries of Central Asia, taking into account the conclusions drawn by the report, particularly through supporting projects and initiatives promoting the defence of universal values and human rights. The experience the EU has in terms of inter-regional cooperation gives it the facilitative role of mediator between the five countries in question, and could help stimulate economic development and combat unemployment. I welcome the adoption of this report, which takes particular care to choose which institutions to support, so that EU funds will not be channelled into governmental organisations or those that do not respect human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the strategy was implemented four years ago, the EU launched important initiatives and programmes to support priorities such as good governance, the rule of law, human rights and democratisation, education and training, economic development, trade and investment, transport and energy, environmental sustainability and water management, and the fight against common threats and challenges. Since 2007, however, substantial changes have taken place in the world. Central Asia has seen important, and unfortunately tragic, events, and new political influences have emerged in the region. All of this has prompted the European institutions to look again at their policy towards Central Asia, to take stock of what has been accomplished and to suggest new approaches tailored to the needs of a region that is facing many threats that could have repercussions for Europe. In this respect, the EU should use the appropriate means to reassess its approach to Central Asia as it did in the case of its immediate neighbourhood. It cannot promote ethical considerations in one part of the world while failing to react to violations of its values in another. This would jeopardise its credibility. In all European activities and initiatives, however, human rights and the rule of law in particular must be supported under all circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus in 2007 the EU introduced a strategy towards the five Central Asian countries, aiming to strengthen and improve the structure and relations between the two regions. This strategy included high-level periodic meetings, cooperation with civil society, resources management and more. Due to changing regional dynamics in Central Asia, caused by inter-ethnic riots, new geostrategic configurations as well as the NATO operation in Afghanistan, the EU has asked to review its 2007 strategy and evaluate its success. The results of this review indicated shortcomings in the 2007 strategy, as standards of good governance and respect to human rights have only slightly improved. In the current state of affairs I welcome the EU’s review and desire to reshape its approach towards Central Asia. Yet I remain hopeful the new strategy will prioritise democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law above any economic, energy or security interests. This is vital for yielding positive results and for maintaining the EU’s credibility. The new strategy for Central Asia genuinely demonstrates EU’s dedication to the region, for enforced and better cooperation can lead to significant social, economic and political achievements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, it is open to question whether the European Union should form an opinion in relation to topics such as climate policy and cultural issues in Asian countries. I believe that the report contains some good elements, particularly in terms of the aforementioned economic analyses, but it does not succeed on an overall level as a result of some rather patronising evaluations.

The countries in that region have undergone a truly turbulent history; during the Cold War they were part of the Soviet Union, and after independence they underwent and, indeed, are still undergoing a difficult test in sustainable democracy. Strong authoritarian regimes, such as the government of President Niyazov in Turkmenistan, or the recent violent unrest in Kyrgyzstan, which led to a coup, are just some examples of the complicated situation in Central Asia. Ms Kiil-Nielsen says in her report that discussions and negotiations with the Central Asian countries must be approached with the same emphasis and firmness as we approach our immediate neighbours. Now, I do not wish to assert that, in the case of Central Asia, we should be more lenient on human rights or that we should forgive them something that we would not forgive our other partners. I would, however, like to say that, in our approach to these countries, we should take into account their different culture, the political behaviour of their citizens, and their varying degrees of transition to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur reminds us that since 2007 the EU has strengthened its relations with the countries of Central Asia, which are of strategic importance to Europe, and has introduced regular bilateral dialogues on human rights and national water policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU has not succeeded in incorporating its various objectives into programmes that are effective and suited to the realities of the region and the — often tragic — events in Central Asia which could have repercussions for Europe. The rapporteur takes the view that the EU must take steps to strengthen its engagement in Central Asia, avoiding an operational mode that gives the highest priority to maintaining the stability of existing regimes in the name of a variety of considerations such as the remote possibility of a diversification of our gas supply or the establishment of military bases to supply the European forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In its new approach the EU must act as a mediator in order to ensure that fundamental human rights are respected by Central Asian governments and that there is real regional cooperation between the countries of Central Asia. Equally important in monitoring these objectives will be the establishment of an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> EU-Central Asia parliamentary forum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I strongly agree with the Kiil-Nielsen focus on environmental policy – in Uzbekistan, for example, decades of Soviet environmental mismanagement for purposes of cotton growing have damaged the Aral Sea, and in mountainous Tajikistan, soil erosion through deforestation for agricultural development has led to desertification.

It is essential to ensure a higher level of health and safety at work, to prevent risks, to reduce rates of occupational accidents and diseases, and to take into consideration the positive impact of good workplace health and safety management at national and European level, as well as at company level. I do not doubt that adequate prevention for workers fosters well-being, quality of work and productivity. I would highlight a growing phenomenon that also has an impact in this area: subcontracting and temporary work, which often involve tense and sometimes illegal labour relations, making identification of responsibility for workplace health and safety provisions difficult. Finally, I would like to emphasise the need to pay more attention to the growing impact of chronic, work-related health problems, such as musculoskeletal disorders and psycho-social risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way in which work or production activities are organised must not breach this absolute requirement of European policies. It is important that the actions of European institutions are aimed at monitoring occupational risks and diseases, by attempting to integrate the definitions and instruments of the health policy applied by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the objective of the policies must be, in line with the provisions of the Europe 2020 strategy, to avoid discriminatory treatment or any differentiation between categories of European workers in terms of access to health-care services. Likewise, these policies must also consider the position of more vulnerable professional groups exposed to additional health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The policies must therefore meet the interests of young or elderly employees, foreign workers or those employed on a temporary contract basis.

The increasing number of employees on sick leave for physical or psychological reasons highlights a serious problem in Europe’s current world of work. Ensuring health and safety at work is therefore one of the major challenges with regard to employees’ daily lives. Good working conditions are needed to enable there to be trust in the employer-employee relationship. I fully support the values promoted by Ms Delli’s own-initiative report, which was adopted by a very large majority on Thursday 15 December. The recognition and assessment of the possible risks of using and having new technologies – such as nanomaterials – in the workplace is a significant step forward. Above all, the increased awareness of the challenge that stress at work represents is crucial. Stress is a major barrier to productivity in Europe and is characteristic of the genuine sense of unease felt by many workers. In order to combat this phenomenon, awareness and understanding of the issue must be strengthened among employers, workers and their representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Community Strategy 2007-2012 makes clear that this is not sufficient, but that the legislation needs to be developed to adapt it to new risks, such as psycho-social risks. In my view the implementation of policies and practices promoting health at work has beneficial results in all areas, economic, social and personal. I believe that labour inspectorates verify that OSH legislation is properly applied and therefore they have a crucial role in preventing and monitoring risks. In my view inspectors also play a positive role in improving the provision of information and the level of expertise in an enterprise. The Member States should therefore strengthen the staff and resources of their labour inspection services. In this context, it is important to identify the categories of workers at risk so as to determine the appropriate responses so they enjoy effective respect for their fundamental right to health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not agree with these parts of the report, which pays attention to classes of people no more vulnerable than millions of European citizens who, in the current crisis, are in serious difficulties from an employment, social and economic point of view.

In addition, greater attention should be paid to risk prevention, which is necessary in order to reduce the number of occupational accidents and illnesses. Good management of workers’ health and safety systems has a positive impact at both national and European levels and for specific companies. Thus, the branches of occupational health and safety policies must be harmonised at European and national levels and be comprehensively reflected in other public policies, such as health, employment, industry, the environment, transport, education, energy, regional development, public procurement and the internal market. Gender-mainstreaming should also be implemented in all policy areas in order to better reflect the specific risks faced by female workers. The adoption, planning and implementation of national strategies should take into consideration the specific situation of each Member State, targeting the sectors and companies most affected by occupational accidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this fact is far from adequate to guarantee occupational health and safety as reality is forcing us to take increasingly into account psycho-social risks. These risks are not covered well enough by EU or national legislation. At European level, companies address these risks by providing occupational training programmes. However, workers suffer most often due to the organisation of work and an unsuitable management style.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes it necessary to examine the connection between the drawbacks of the workplace and the organisation of work. I must mention the positive role played by staff who legitimately warn about unrecognised risks within a company. Whistle-blowing should be protected, as it is in some countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world. In the United Kingdom whistle-blowers have been protected against dismissal and any form of pressure since 1998.

In addition to these individual personal tragedies, the economic costs of these accidents represent a huge burden on our societies, up to 5.9% of GDP according to the rapporteur. I am disappointed that neither the Commission’s mid-term revision of the current strategy nor the 2009 Scoreboard provided any clear information on the state of play at Member State level of the only quantified aim set in the current strategy, namely a 25% reduction in workplace accidents by 2012. The economic crisis cannot be used to undermine health and safety, particularly among SMEs or self-employed workers; all workers are entitled to the protection of their health and safety in their workplace. We need to develop a better culture of prevention. As recommended by the ILO, Member States must meet the target of one inspector for every 10 000 workers. I would encourage the Commission to come forward with an ambitious strategy for the EU after 2012, particularly in the areas of new risks, work-related stress and the protection of whistleblowers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands of people die, at huge cost to people, businesses and social security. We have to guard against occupational diseases, both physical and mental. The text under consideration concerns the mid-term review of the European strategy 2007-2014 on health and safety at work. According to this report, 168 000 EU citizens every year die victims of accidents at work or of occupational diseases and 7 million are injured. It is a subject that requires a new approach, so as to reduce the risk of occupational accidents and diseases, which would bring considerable savings, and would improve productivity and quality of life. The potential risks of new diseases due to new technologies and new substances, like nanomaterials, should be taken into account in the legislation in force, as should work-related stress. Furthermore, it is crucial that workers feel at liberty to blow the whistle on any situations liable to cause an accident and do not feel constrained to keep quiet.

It also seeks to put a greater focus on stress and on psychosocial risk factors. It stresses statistics broken down according to gender and risk assessment reflecting gender differences. It aims to improve worker participation in the conception, support and implementation of prevention policy and calls for stronger links with the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, advocating a ban on asbestos, and reemphasises the International Labour Organisation recommendation about risk prevention inspectors and work inspectors. </p>

Thanks to the adoption and application, in recent decades, of a large body of EU laws, it has been possible to improve working conditions in the EU Member States and to make considerable progress in reducing the incidence of work-related accidents and illnesses. For both economic and human reasons, health and safety at work deserves considerable attention in the EU’s policy agenda, since it plays an important role in increasing the competitiveness and productivity of enterprises and contributing to the sustainability of social security systems. It results in reduced costs for injuries, accidents and diseases and enhances worker motivation. Occupational accidents and diseases represent an enormous burden for public and private social security systems and require an integrated, coordinated and strategic response, as well as cooperation between the main parties involved in the EU. I think that it will be desirable to focus in future health and safety legislation on the promotion and use of technologies that reduce the risks posed by dangerous substances, in the case of occupational injuries. It would also be advisable to consider whether these technologies could replace the use of chemical and radioactive substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the important aims of the strategy should be the reduction of the proportion of accidents and illnesses occurring at the workplace. I find the protection of workers in high-risk categories to be especially important. These include people working in hazardous sectors, such as construction industry and chemical industry workers, people with disabilities, young workers and women. Nowadays, the psychological pressure caused by work-related stress and deadlines is a negative factor of exceedingly great significance. This is primarily caused by poor work organisation and management style. I completely agree with the view that we must be careful not to allow the austerity measures caused by the economic crisis to be implemented at the expense of safety at work under any circumstances. It is important to use uniform standards in all EU Member States. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in recent years, but I trust that the harmonisation taking place in this respect will be successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur rightly points out, not all problems can be resolved through legal provisions. There is reason to suspect that Brussels has not grasped this fact, however. After all, the protection of workers has been used as the pretext for an attempt to regulate the consumption of cigarettes in restaurants, instead of openly admitting the underlying concern for the health of non-smokers and seeking solutions acceptable to our citizens and workable in everyday situations.

<p class="contents">Studies show that young workers aged between 15 and 24 are exposed to particularly high risks of injury, and the long-term consequences of an illness or injuries sustained when young may be considerable. This is why I continue to support the need to include an occupational health and security aspect in existing EU programmes, such as the ‘Youth on the Move’ programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted against paragraph F which considers that extending elderly workers’ working life offers a solution to the labour shortage. I also voted against paragraph 71 because I consider that, in order to reduce stress at work, introducing specialised training on how to work under stressful conditions, as well as workshops on teamwork and improving the integration of a given group of workers is not sufficient. What is needed is for working conditions to be improved in practical terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many as 168 000 workers across Europe die each year as a result of work-related accidents or diseases – we need to look specifically at the risks associated with new technologies and harmful substances to make sure that appropriate legislation is put in place. I also welcome calls to ensure the protection of whistleblowers in the workplace – people should be able to warn of risks at work without fear of reprisal and the practice of ‘blacklisting’ those who speak out must be brought to an end. I am however disappointed that UK Conservatives refused to support an end to this unfair behaviour. The report also deals with work-related stress, which is a major problem for many people, especially with the increasing number of people being made redundant as a result of the economic crisis. Awareness of this issue needs to be raised with employees, employers and trade unions in order to help increase productivity in the workplace and ensure the wellbeing of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tagi, who was a prominent journalist, allegedly published a newspaper piece arguing that the strict adherence of President Aliyev’s regime to Islamic values was damaging any democratic credentials to which it may lay claim. Allegedly as a result of a fatwa issued by a radical Islamist cleric in Iran, Taqi was stabbed to death, most probably by a fanatic, and died four days later.</p>
<p class="contents">Until significant international pressure was exerted, the Azeri authorities appeared to be at best ambivalent and at worst unconcerned at Taqi’s murder, with still no clear condemnation and only limited coverage of the investigation of the circumstances surrounding his murder. Up to this point, the Iranian authorities, for their part, have neither condemned the fatwa – which appears to have been an incitement to murder – nor have they shown any sign that anyone suspected of inciting, planning or carrying out the crime on Taqi would be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the decision, even if it is somewhat belated, to open a criminal inquiry now into the circumstances of Taqi’s death, and we call upon the Azeri authorities to do all within their power to bring to justice the perpetrator, if he or she is apprehended, following a fair trial to international standards. We call upon the Iranian authorities, too, to cooperate fully with the investigation and to provide all the necessary evidence possible to aid it in its course, although I suspect that Tehran will, sadly, not listen to what we have to say in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned at reports that Azerbaijani authorities have recently used the criminal law to stifle free debate on the issues regarding religion. We feel strongly that Azerbaijan must step up to its legal obligations, as a member of the Council of Europe, to protect human rights and freedom of speech and all the other freedoms that go with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The enemies of Islam should know that the free-hearted Muslims and zealous youths of Islam shall not let the world’s arrogant powers and international Zionism carry out their evil conspiracies and plots in order to insult Islam. They will punish the religion-mongers and those who betray their religion for their shameful acts. I extend my congratulations to all Muslims of the world, especially the zealous people of Azerbaijan, on the death of Rafiq Tagi, the apostate. Meanwhile, we honour the memory of the great religious authority, late grand Ayatollah Fazel Lankarani (may Allah bless him), who issued a decree on the lawfulness of spilling the blood of this atheist’. This was published on the website of Sheikh Fazel Lankarani on the morning of 28 November, after Rafiq Tagi was killed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, no, that is not the Islam that we defend in this Parliament. No, these are not the friends of Islam such as those whom we listened to at the Sakharov Prize award ceremony. If we are calling on the Iranian and Baku authorities to condemn this fatwa, I should also like to say that we here in Parliament wholeheartedly condemn this distortion of Islam, which we can read here and which we find elsewhere. We will always defend an Islam that is moderate and that respects freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Azerbaijani authorities are concerned, there is of course nothing to suggest that they had any involvement in this murder.

In reaction to the publication of this article, a Iranian Grand Ayatollah, Fazel Lankarani, issued a fatwah calling for Mr Tagi to be killed. Nine days later, Mr Tagi was the victim of a knife attack which he did not survive, dying on 23 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tagi was right: Islam is an age-old religion that is only discredited by views such as those of President Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Lankarani. The age-old Persian culture, which we all admire for its sophistication and advances, is tarnished by such people. The coexistence of Persian civilisation and Azerbaijani culture, which is also the product of thousands of years of neighbourhood and proximity, is severely disrupted by this type of attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that its new non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for the period 2012-2014 will lead Iran to take long-awaited measures, such as abolishing the death penalty and putting an end to the systematic and barbarous violations of human rights committed in that country against Iranian citizens, and now outside the country, against citizens of other nations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that we should not simply wait and see. The EU cannot merely adopt this sort of resolution. We have spoken here before, during the last sitting, about the existence of European companies helping the Iranian authorities to carry out Internet censorship of the democratic opposition in Iran, or to distort its communications. We should penalise these European companies, as otherwise our words will lack the necessary credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iranians or local Islamic extremists are suspected of being responsible for this killing. The Azerbaijani authorities are investigating this crime.

It is important that this is investigated and it is essential that the Azerbaijani authorities do so in an independent and credible manner. There is also a clear need to address the fatwa that was issued after Tagi’s critical article. It was issued by an Iranian cleric and it was not condemned sufficiently. We have to make clear that no fatwa can ever be legitimised as a licence to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable also that the Azerbaijani authorities did not condemn this fatwa more strongly and publicly, and that his safety was not guarnteed. Besides the investigation by the Azerbaijani authorities, they have to decide what kind of a society they want to have and create. The murder, which can perhaps be labelled as an ‘incident’, took place in a climate of increased pressure on human rights, civil society and opposition parties, and notably liberal parties.</p>
<p class="contents">If the authorities in Azerbaijan do not clearly choose, both in letter and in practice and application, to adhere to their commitments as members of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and to the country’s other international commitments, the EU should draw consequences. We strongly hope and encourage the Azerbaijani authorities to move forward on the path towards a freer and more just society. I am not very hopeful for any collaboration by the Iranian authorities into ascertaining the role that the Iranian cleric played, but we can and must expect more from the Azerbaijani authorities and, as the EU, use our relations with Azerbaijan to pressure them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 10 December, International Human Rights Day, I myself organised a Facebook event called Lanterns of Freedom, which allowed thousands of people in Krakow to remember this important day and the people whose freedom is constrained. We cannot allow people to be thrown into prison for similar actions in other countries, particularly not in countries of the Eastern Partnership.</p>

However, Islamic influence is fairly intense due to the radical Iranian regime in Azerbaijan’s neighbourhood. Some proof of that is provided by the murder of Rafiq Tagi, which was probably committed on the basis of a fatwa issued by an Iranian spiritual leader. The European Union must be more active in encouraging the population of Azerbaijan to adopt the civilised democratic way of life. It is therefore appropriate to express some concern to the Azerbaijani Government over the superficial way in which it has conducted the investigation into the murder of Rafiq Tagi. We must strive to ensure that the Azerbaijani regime genuinely cooperates with the European Union in building a democratic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are deeply worried abut the fact that over the last few years we have noted a trend of increasing restrictions in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent months we have witnessed several severe actions taken by the authorities vis-à-vis organised street protests, as well as attempts to organise protests inspired by the Arab Spring revolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The detention of activists and other repressive measures against protesters are indeed deeply regrettable. This crackdown on civil society is paralleled by worsening conditions for freedom of expression in the country, while the space for independent media outlets seems to be shrinking. In the recent past several journalists have been harassed, convicted on unclear charges or physically attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we are particularly saddened about the death of Rafiq Tagi  on 23 November. During our recent session of the Subcommittee on Justice, Freedom, Security and Human rights and Democracy as well as during the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Council, we made a firm call upon the Azerbaijani authorities to carry out a swift and impartial investigation in this case and to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a responsibility to convey clear messages on the importance of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law, which are cornerstones in our cooperation with Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of ambition of the EU’s relationship with Azerbaijan will take into account the extent to which these values are reflected in national practices and policy implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Ashton had the opportunity to pass this message on during her visit to Baku last month. In this context I would also like to recall the joint declaration of the Warsaw Eastern Partnership Summit, where all participants committed to respect the values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. Of course I also welcome the role of the European Parliament in advocating democratic values to the partners in Azerbaijan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Limiting and violating fundamental human rights by threatening and silencing people who have dared to criticise the authorities is an everday occurrence. The independent media and opposition journalists, who are often imprisoned because of the contents of their publications, are in a particularly bad situation. The government remains indifferent to their fate, and a good example of this is the case of Rafiq Tagi. Tagi had been given a prison sentence for inciting religious hatred as a result of his activities as a journalist. His articles had caused discontent among Muslims, who issued a fatwa condemning him to death, and the authorities did not protect him from these threats. A few weeks ago, Rafiq Tagi died as a result of injuries inflicted by unknown perpetrators. This event coincided with the International Day to End Impunity and gave rise to protests from journalists around the world, who have called for a stop to be put to the murdering of their colleagues and have demanded that the culprits be punished. We should show solidarity with the Azeri media and strive to maintain freedom of expression in Azerbaijan, as well as calling upon the international community to put an end to impunity for attacks on journalists not only in this country, but all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

Human rights abuses perpetrated against women remain commonplace, sadly, and more worryingly are frequently tolerated by the authorities. Pakistan’s tradition of honour killings must be addressed in particular, and the government there must take much stronger action to ensure that this crime in particular does not go unpunished. Genital mutilation is still reported in some rural parts of Pakistan, and therefore we urge the authorities to investigate these alleged crimes fully as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan, for its part, has the second-highest rate of maternal mortality in the world, and we call upon the Afghan Government to do more in the area of maternal health. Sharia law enacted in some areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan permits the execution of pregnant women, and this must, of course, be condemned in the strongest possible terms and is indeed against UN international human rights declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the significant financial and technical EU aid in Afghanistan, girls and women are still experiencing major difficulties in accessing primary education due to deeply-rooted cultural discrimination against the female sex. Safeguards aiming to ensure gender equality are not acted upon, especially in the recruitment of women to positions of influence, such as the national legislature or the judiciary. It is imperative that this situation is addressed and a concrete, lasting and enforceable solution found before NATO ISAF forces finally withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent talks at the Bonn Conference were indeed encouraging. We believe that, as well as the measures taken by the governments of the countries themselves, the Commission should give even more assistance to those projects that promote and protect the rights of women in these two countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Afghanistan, as well as in Pakistan, women are socially marginalised, and are denied the opportunity of developing and fully exploiting their potential. Numerous prohibitions, punishments and physical and psychological discrimination limiting the areas in which women may be active are nothing unusual in these countries. The situation of Afghan women has improved somewhat in recent years due to the fall of the Taliban regime. However, the conditions of women in Pakistan has deteriorated significantly due to the introduction of discriminatory regulations, such as the law on blasphemy, which allows the persecution of both women and minority groups.</p>
<p class="contents">A review of the rights of women in the national law of these two countries should therefore be a first step towards ensuring decent living conditions for women there, including the right to professional and personal development, together with protection for the safety of women in schools and at work. In view of the long-term support offered by the Union to both of these countries, it is our duty not only to express our concerns in connection with discrimination against women, but also to call for equal treatment of men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the government, over 4 million girls are attending school and higher education; 17% of civil servants are female and more than 25% of the members of parliament are women.</p>
<p class="contents">However, improvements remain fragile, and are often reduced to rhetoric. Female illiteracy and maternal and infant mortality rates remain among the worst in the world. Women and girls continue to face endemic domestic violence, trafficking, forced marriages, including child marriages, and in particular the abusive practice of Boad continues to occur regularly, where a girl is given to an agreed family to compensate for a committed crime. Let us remember as well that the stoning and physical disfigurement of women accused of violating the repressive social code of the Taliban and other insurgent groups are still a common occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghan women with public roles have faced increasing attacks. This is something which we need to address and this is why we ask the Afghan security forces not only to be trained in counter-insurgency but also in law and order, community safety and protecting women and children from abuse. Let us remember, that women should also be leaders of organisations and be included in the design, monitoring and evaluation of the provincial security indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">On Pakistan, we have to denounce similar situations. The fact that in some regions the authorities are acting in a very similar way to those in Afghanistan is especially worrying. This is why we ask the Pakistani Government to reintroduce the fundamental rights of the 1973 Constitution which were suspended after the military coup in 1997, including the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can identify in both countries certain elements which can be described as positive. For example, in Afghanistan, some women have been appointed to positions of responsibility. Gulnaz, who had been a rape victim and initially sentenced to prison, was recently pardoned, while in Pakistan the adoption of the law on preventing certain practices against women and the law against acid attacks adopted at the start of the week are all encouraging signs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some extremely harsh practices persist in both countries. Domestic violence is prevalent in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Again, in Afghanistan, stoning and physical disfigurement are used for breaches of social norms. In Pakistan, women are victims of honour crimes, and there is also forced conversion to Islam. These practices are especially alarming and we must denounce them in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The differences are even more marked within the countries. Pakistan had a female head of government long before Germany. Afghanistan has not yet reached that point, yet it does have a number of female provincial governors. There are, however, regions and tribal areas in both countries where women are still not permitted to attend school or even visit the doctor. Such crass differences within the countries can only be eliminated through patient reforms rather than ideology.</p>

The majority religion, which deprives women of most of their human rights, has a decisive influence on their situation.</p>

Ninety per cent of Afghan women have experienced beatings, rape, mental harassment or forced marriage.

The irrationality of the outcome of this is the result of interpretations of Sharia law. Thus, for example, if a woman is raped, that is adultery on her part, and the shame redounds to the woman’s male relations. Such an interpretation is a disgrace to Islam. It is against life, humanity and human justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In both countries, however, the trend has been two-pronged: a small but growing number of women exert influence in the upper echelons of society, while, in rural areas, women live in extreme poverty. It is easier for a woman, for example, to set up her own design business in the city than to sell vegetables in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is a positive sign that the status of women has improved in some aspects, but sustainable change will be impossible to achieve if there are to be different rules in force in different areas and for different social classes. Now it is important to focus on women’s problems in rural areas also, because the improvement in human rights, as indicated in the statistics, does not correspond to the actual situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, preparations are being made for a transitional government, including the Taliban, which will mean a significant regression to all sorts of practices traditional in that country; sometimes anti-women practices, such as the practice of <span class="italic">baad</span> – the sale of women – or of gang rape as a way of avenging the honour of certain families.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, let us vote for these resolutions, but let us also demand that the EU be fully aware of these events, particularly when it implements its agreements with these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rape, abuse, the trafficking of women, children being forced into marriage and violence in the home are the fate of almost every woman in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, they rarely result in action on the part of the police or the judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Taleban gone, the Afghans have of course been given constitutional social rights and access to education, yet discrimination still exists in access to basic health care and cultural life generally. Women must be allowed to participate actively in building a democratic, secure and open society. Afghanistan cannot just ignore women, who make up more than half the entire country’s population.

On the occasion of the recent Bonn Conference, the EU, together with the international community, highlighted again the importance it attaches to upholding the rights of women. Vice-President Ashton, together with Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, met a group of Afghan women at the beginning of the Conference. They are a real inspiration to all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU supports an Afghan-led reconciliation process, it remains particularly important to safeguard and expand on the progress Afghanistan has made in the field of human rights, and rights of women in particular, since 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of Afghan women in this society often remains precarious. The EU brings up the issue directly with the government of Afghanistan whenever appropriate and makes its position clear through public statements – for instance the statement on women’s shelters in Afghanistan of February 2011. It has also reconfirmed its position in the Council conclusions of last July and again in November.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased access to justice and legal aid services for women affected by family violence is a very important element of the EU’s assistance, while progress across the board will depend on broader reforms of Afghanistan’s justice institutions. The EU is closely involved in this sector and supports Afghan efforts in this respect in the context of the Kabul Process.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Pakistan, promotion of women’s rights is a priority for the EU and Member States’ engagement with Pakistan. Although progress depends on action by the government of that country, the EU and Member States can exercise influence through engagement and dialogue with the authorities, by supporting measures which address women’s human rights and by assisting access to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Among many human rights concerns faced by women in Pakistan, violence is one of the most serious issues to address. The EU consistently uses its political dialogue with Pakistan to raise issues relating to the rights of women. A long-term objective is to ensure effective implementation of the UN Convention for Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, of which Pakistan is a signatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term the EU is supporting measures to ensure implementation of legislation in Pakistan to outlaw all forms of violence against women and ensure support for victims of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, their vulnerability rests solely on the way society perceives and treats women. Vulnerability is a social construct, and what is made by people can by remade by people. Violence is a main factor that makes women vulnerable. In Afghanistan, on 12 November, a woman and her daughter were executed by stoning in Ghazni, Kandahar, an area where Sharia law is imposed. In Pakistan, Asia Bibi, a Christian woman, mother of five children is the first woman to be sentenced to death under the blasphemy laws. She is being held on death row, while an Islamic cleric offered a cash prize of about EUR 5000 for her killing. The government in the two countries must put an end to such abuses and ensure the protection of the life and integrity of all, including women. The EU must urge the authorities of Afghanistan and Pakistan to protect women’s rights.

<p class="contents">No one could have imagined what would happen in the Arab world within the space of a year, and what we have seen unfold before our eyes. The text that we have before us in this instance, about the case of Zakaria Bouguira, who protested against the police by testifying to an instance of police brutality, in a sense means that we have come full circle. We have come a long way in a year. That is why the Tunisian people do not call their revolution the Jasmine Revolution, but the Dignity Revolution: because over the course of a year we have gone from someone who had no other means of expression in the face of police brutality or police humiliation than self-immolation, to someone whose desire from his country’s politics is for dignity. What he wants is dignity for the citizen who protests and dignified treatment by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As for us, this should compel us to think outside the confines of this urgent case before Parliament. It should compel us to think that in Tunisia we have probably the best example of the new wave of Arab democracy and that we, on this side of the Mediterranean, where we have crises in southern Mediterranean countries, are not making use of the demographic dynamics, nor the economic dynamics, nor the political dynamics of these countries. We are only interested in closing borders and barring refugees from entering. I believe that we should, first and foremost, rethink our European policies, as a matter of urgency.

<p class="contents">In the light of this recent commitment we must urge the Tunisian Government to do all it can to make sure that the authorities deal properly with the case brought forward by Zakaria Bouguira in a transparent manner and in line with the law. The same manner must also be used when it investigates the alleged use of torture against the Moroccan nationals implicated in the case, and we must push in this House for there to be an independent criminal inquiry into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the challenges that Tunisia faces after holding its first free and democratic elections in this period of transition, and for this reason we believe that a reform process must be fully implemented in order to establish a stronger and lasting multi-party pluralist democracy in the long term in Tunisia, and one that is based on human rights and the rule of law, with an independent judiciary and an accountable police force and, most importantly, a free media.</p>
<p class="contents">We again congratulate the Tunisian people on holding the first democratic election to come forth from the Arab Spring, on 23 October. There was an EP mission observing that election, and the European Union must continue to support the Tunisian people in their clear democratic aspirations. As such, we call on the Tunisian authorities to carry on reforming the security forces and ending any climate of impunity.

<p class="contents">I should have preferred the majority of this Parliament to pay more attention to this issue before December 2010. We know, as Tunisian democrats know, how silent the European Union was until 14 February 2011 on the human rights violations carried out under the Ben Ali regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the first line of our resolution does not shy away from that point. Read it and you will see. However, the past is the past and it cannot be rewritten. We can only try to learn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia is moving towards a democratic transition. The elections on 23 October took place smoothly. The results are there to see. We must respect the choice made by the Tunisians. We welcome the fact that the new Tunisian authorities have already signed numerous international conventions. We must help them to implement them, without interfering. Supporters of the former RCD continue to play a very active role in the administration, notably the justice ministry and the police. The serious police errors referred to here are proof of that.</p>
<p class="contents">We must help the new Tunisia, but we must not lecture it. Above all, Commissioner, we must not demand more of this new Tunisia than we did in the past in terms of democracy and human rights. We must pay attention to how we get our message across. I believe that that is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we are discussing Tunisia because we are faced with an extremely interesting issue and one which is of concern to Tunisians.

The issue concerns how quickly structures of authority can change, especially involving law enforcement agencies and the police.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions were divided at the time the elections were taking place and we were talking with Tunisian citizens: some said that the police and law enforcement agencies were intimidated and too weak. Here we have the case involving Zakaria Bouguira, showing us the other side of the coin, the other view, which is aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the key to this matter must be to investigate the file meticulously and punish those who are guilty of this specific incident. This will allow Tunisian citizens to gain real trust in their institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The award was certainly intended and is intended to support those who continue on the long, difficult path of transition and the struggle towards free and just societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Zakaria Bouguira’s case does not necessarily give us cause for hope. He witnessed and filmed the abuse of power and the use of violence by the Tunisian police against Moroccan soccer supporters, and as a result he was attacked by around 20 police officers. Tunisia should do away with these Ben Ali-style practices and oppression. Besides respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance, we are specifically concerned with the role that technologies can play. They can be used to enable free speech, freedom of the press and access to information and, as this case shows, the documentation of human rights violations. It would be a huge mistake and missed opportunity if surveillance, censorship, tracking and tracing technologies continue to be deployed against people, as happened under the Ben Ali government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there are repressive forces in many countries – including state apparatus and the army – which continue to try to exert force in the brutal manner to which they have become accustomed. On the other hand, there is great uncertainty among those who no longer know what is or is not legitimate and when they should or should not take action. This is quite a normal situation after the fall of a dictatorship. The other difficulty is that no one seems to know what direction these countries are taking.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposition movement knew what it did not want, but we do not know what the future will bring for these countries. That is why we should provide our help, while avoiding a nannying approach. It is of crucial importance for us to decide what we can offer these countries in terms of political development in a spirit of partnership, how we can help develop professional training, encourage medium-sized enterprises, collaborate on energy policy, such as solar energy and other renewable energies in cooperation with medium-size enterprises. This is where we must focus our attention. We have a wide range of tasks ahead of us. That is why we must choose the path of partnership, not paternalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The building of a new and, we hope, more decent and better society in Tunisia will certainly take some time. The new administration will have to rebuild and retrain its public order and judicial authorities in such a way that the Tunisian population no longer sees them as repressive elements brutally suppressing freedom, but as state bodies that protect their peaceful life.

One example is the incident in November, in which a young Tunisian man tried to film on his mobile phone the violent treatment of Moroccans at an airport by the Tunisian authorities. The man had wanted to bring to the attention of the public the poor situation regarding human rights and the violent actions of the authorities, in order to promote development towards a democratic Tunisia.

The authorities constantly employ needless violence, and there is no information on sentencing either. It is important to persuade Tunisia’s new Government to intervene in the situation and thus also bring about a change in the way the authorities act. Without commitment to change on the part of the government and the public sector, it will be impossible to establish a development agenda to improve human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the Tunisian authorities must very clearly get the message from this incident that the rule of law is established with accountability, which means that an investigation is carried out and those guilty of genuine violations are punished because, otherwise, it will become a habit.</p>

I hope that this resolution will sound an alarm bell too for all those who decide to control their population by means of surveillance, because Tunisia is not alone in risking to choose this path.

There can be no doubt that Tunisia must reform the law enforcement sector and the judiciary as soon as possible. They should be covered by regulations which guarantee respect for human rights and impose sanctions for their violation. Therefore, I particularly support the call for the creation of a National Human Rights Council, which would act as a guardian of international human rights standards. This institution could also examine individual complaints from citizens and investigate violations of human rights. The European Union should make the best possible use of the instruments at its disposal under the Neighbourhood Policy in order to assist the process of democratic transformation in Tunisia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was very moved to see the great defender of human rights, Moncef Marzouki, inaugurated as President of the Tunisian Republic two days ago. I am aware that Tunisia has everything in place to take the right path towards democracy, but I am also aware that the incident of Zakaria Bouguira and the 13 young Moroccan victims of abuse shows that this is a long road, requiring great perseverance and support. In particular, the EU should provide support in relation to system reform in the security sector, for those working in the justice system, police, magistrates, judges, and those working in the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice. The EU can make the difference by supporting the necessary reforms, and in this sense it would also be very useful if Tunisia were to consider setting up a Council of Human Rights, as this resolution requests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in contact with his family, and the case has been formally raised with the competent authorities: the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice. A judicial procedure has finally been opened, and we will follow its development.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, this case shows the urgency for Tunisia to move more resolutely towards democratic transition and ensure the independence of the judiciary, a proper reform of the security sector, freedom of the media and better democratic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">At the political level, the EU has expressed to the Tunisian authorities its willingness to support democratic reforms and will continue to do so in the future. We are also determined to translate these political commitments into concrete cooperation activities. With this aim in mind, an ambitious programme in support of the reform of the judiciary is currently in preparation. In addition, in response to a request from the Minister for the Interior, we are currently discussing the possibility of a peer review of the security sector as a first step towards increased dialogue and cooperation in this very sensitive sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In both cases, civil society will be duly consulted in the preparation of the programmes. We are also finalising a technical facility, which will allow us to support a wide range of activities in the field of democratic transition and governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel to this dialogue with the authorities, we are reinforcing our support for Tunisian civil society. As experience has shown, in order to succeed, a democratic transition needs strong political will from the authorities but also an effective and organised civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate to this Parliament the determination of the EU to support democratic transition in Tunisia. It is in this framework that we want to have an open dialogue with the Tunisian authorities, also to express our concerns, as is the case today in terms of what happened to Mr Zakaria Bouguira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One year on, however, we see that the practices commonly used under the old regime are still in place. We note that members of the public are still regularly subjected to many acts of violence and brutal practices on the part of the security forces, in breach of Tunisia's international human rights undertakings. The event that took place at Tunis-Carthage airport on 13 November is just one example. Zakaria Bouguira, a student, witnessed acts of violence committed by law enforcement officers against a group of young Moroccans. He filmed the scene with his mobile phone so he could broadcast it. A security guard immediately stopped him filming and he was brutally beaten. A complaint has been filed. I therefore call on the authorities to engage in a process of reform of the security sector (including the police and the judicial system), to guarantee independence of the judiciary and to guarantee freedom and independence of the press and the media. I believe that for these reforms to be accepted by the population, it must involve civil society bodies working in this area as fully as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
