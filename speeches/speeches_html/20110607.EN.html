<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I should like to thank all of you for this opportunity to inform you about developments in relation to the outbreak of E coli.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned about the heavy burden of death and disease that this food-borne epidemic has caused the European population and want to take the opportunity once again to express my condolences to those who are suffering as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I have to note that the situation is still evolving. There are now over 1 672 Shiga-toxin-producing E coli cases, and serious complications have developed in at least 661 people. According to the latest information, this outbreak is responsible for 21 deaths in Germany and 1 in Sweden. Sporadic cases are reported in 11 other Member States. Switzerland has also reported 15 cases and the United States 4. The epicentre of the disease is still the area around Hamburg in northern Germany. Most of the cases reported outside Germany concern either German nationals travelling or persons who visited this part of Germany. So what is the European Commission doing to tackle the outbreak?</p>
<p class="contents">First, we have immediately activated all our networks responsible for managing crises. The networks are in daily contact and allow for the timely exchange of information, laying the ground for rapid action. The Commission holds almost daily meetings with your public health authorities and food safety authorities to discuss the evolution of the outbreak, the health measures taken to prevent infection and the treatment of affected people. The Early Warning and Response System and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed have provided a solid basis for exchanging information.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we have asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to do a scientific risk assessment, which is being updated regularly as the situation evolves. We now have an EU case definition which will allow Member States to share the same approach on the investigation of the outbreak. Patient questionnaires for outbreak investigations are being collected and compared by the ECDC. The ECDC has also developed, together with the European Food Safety Authority, advice on preventive measures addressed to the public. This advice is now available in all official languages on the Commission website.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked the ECDC to urgently set up a platform to exchange best practice on treatment, involving both Member States and professional societies. Our food safety EU reference laboratory in Rome developed in record time a method which reduces the time needed to detect the E coli bacterium in food from about six days to 48 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me stress that public perception is extremely important. In this regard, the Commission draws up daily updates, shared with the Health Security Committee communicators’ network and food safety authorities. In addition, the Commission keeps its website dedicated to this outbreak up to date.</p>
<p class="contents">I would strongly urge Members of the European Parliament to support this science-based communication to the public, in order to reduce unnecessary fears and to reinforce our common efforts. I can assure you that the Commission, together with these agencies, is working very hard with national health and food safety ministries to support them in containing this outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">To do that, we need to pursue intensively the investigation into the source of contamination; the work is taking place as I speak. During the Health Council yesterday, I asked Germany to reinforce surveillance, outbreak controls and measures in order to identify the source of the outbreak and halt the spread of the infection. I also asked that the causes of the contamination should be swiftly dealt with. The German authorities accepted the Commission proposal to dispatch to Germany experts in epidemiology of food-borne diseases from the Commission, the ECDC and the EFSA.</p>
<p class="contents">On Sunday, 5 June, the experts started their mission to assist German authorities with the ongoing epidemiology, verify the results and contribute to the ongoing investigations to identify the source. As we all know, the initial suspicion raised by the German authorities that cucumbers from Spain were the cause has not been confirmed by any test results available.</p>
<p class="contents">On Sunday, 5 June, the German authorities notified the European Commission that, based on the epidemiological investigations, they believe bean sprouts are the possible source of the E coli outbreak affecting mainly the northern part of Germany. The information was transferred immediately to all Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission follows any new development closely, and will decide on the appropriate course of action the moment laboratory tests confirm any epidemiological finding. We do not have any results to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, I should stress that it is crucial that national authorities do not rush to give information on any source of infection which is not proven by bacteriological analysis, as this spreads unjustified fears in the population all over Europe and creates problems for our food producers selling products in the EU and outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">While such intensive investigations are going on, we must be careful not to jump to premature conclusions. In this respect, I want to refer to the latest information coming from Germany regarding the suspicion that sprouts may be the source of contamination; it noted that laboratory tests have not been concluded and that consequently, premature conclusions have to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">This illustrates that it is important for the Member States to introduce well sustained and scientifically based alerts into the RASFF and to trigger the RASFF when Member States are confident regarding the scientific evidence supporting the alert notification.</p>
<p class="contents">You have to act quickly and decisively in order to preserve the Internal Market. If we manage to do this, then we can learn from the lessons of this crisis and continually improve our systems. I have been repeating: our system works. We need to learn lessons as we go along. I believe that this is our responsibility: to be flexible and to be fast in adjusting our processes and procedures to respond to these types of incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination and clear lines of information and communication remain the core of our ability to be effective in such situations. We have to learn lessons on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing, I would like to raise briefly two more points. The first concerns references to bans on certain products. I would like to stress again that the outbreak is limited geographically to an area surrounding the city of Hamburg, so there is no reason, as of today, to take such measures at European level. In the light of this and of the steps towards the identification of the source, we consider any ban on any product as disproportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am also very sensitive to the financial impact that this crisis is having on farmers, particularly vegetable producers. This is why I am working closely with my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, to address the hardship faced by this group of our citizens that has also been hit by the outbreak. In fact, Agriculture Ministers are holding an extraordinary Council meeting today to address E coli. As I finish talking to you, I will head back to Brussels to be with my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, during this extraordinary Agriculture Ministers’ Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are in constant contact with third countries, in particular Russia, to ask them to lift their ban, which is considered disproportionate. The Commission is working hand in hand with the Member States with one common goal: to bring this outbreak to an end as soon as possible. I am insisting to all concerned that, in situations like this, it is not a local problem, it is a European problem.</p>

I would like to do the same. Hundreds of people are severely ill. Medical personnel in northern Germany are really at their limit. Twenty-two people have already died. Yesterday in the Council, a representative of another Member State, Luxembourg, said that financial losses could be recompensed, but human life cannot. Therefore, I would firstly like to ask for understanding with regard to issuing a warning even if we are not 100% certain where the source is but only have a suspicion – that we also make this information public.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we still have to find the source. I see that many people working for the authorities, with the support of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), too – my sincere thanks to the European institutions and to Commissioner Dalli for the fact that the European Union is also helping to investigate this matter – are really working very intensively on this. Nevertheless, as a German Member of this House, I cannot stand here and say that everything is going well. There have been a few problems in connection with the crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Hamburg Health Senator informed the public, which was the right thing to do, even if there was not absolute certainty with regard to the Spanish cucumbers. The EHEC pathogen was on the Spanish cucumbers and it should not have been there. Even the Spanish Members must understand that. However, she informed the public first and only very much later, hours or half a day later, she informed the European Commission and the Spanish authorities. That was unacceptable. In this regard, we in Germany must also consider internally how we could manage this better. However, together we should concentrate on the fact that the enemy is not in Spain or in Germany, but rather the real problem is the pathogen that we need to get under control and to combat.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that we adopted a resolution during the last plenary sitting on the subject of resistance to antibiotics. Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics, we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics. This is a long-standing subject that we now need to tackle more quickly because next time, it could be the case that the pathogen has to be treated with antibiotics but, because it is resistant, it is not possible to treat it. We need to work on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, I met a representative of the US Food and Drug Administration. She was telling me about the problems of E coli in fruit and vegetables in the United States and we discussed how this was not common in the European Union. Now we have had this outbreak, so we have to ask ourselves some questions. Is it about our farming practices, as Peter Liese just mentioned? Is it about intensive farming, hot-housing fruit and vegetables? Is it about overuse of antibiotics in livestock? Is it about manure spreading? Would more accurate food labelling have helped us to identify more quickly the source of the contamination? I note that the Council is not here today, but the Council is resisting proper country of origin labelling on our foods. I hope they will listen to this debate in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, we need to investigate thoroughly for the longer term and we need to learn lessons and integrate them into our policies. Too often, we hear from this Commission and from many in this House about over-regulation, but, as with the banks, I am starting to wonder whether we tend to put the needs of market and supply chains ahead of those of public protection and the consumer. ‘Business as usual’ is not going to be good enough. It is not normal that people in Europe go out for a salad and die as a consequence, and we need policy change to address this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, it is to them that our first thoughts must go, as well as to the farmers who are in a very difficult position, one that we can perfectly understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make three points. Firstly, we uphold the precautionary principle. It was applied in this case, so we cannot complain, and the consequences will obviously have to be dealt with. As Mr Liese pointed out just now, human beings clearly come before economic issues, which can be dealt with at any time. Death, unfortunately, is permanent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I fully agree with what Mrs McAvan just said about the importance of traceability. We are discussing labelling today. It is absolutely vital that we have comprehensive labelling and that we can trace products in order to know where they have originated from.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, regarding the absolutely crucial issue at the heart of the problem, we must admit that we do not know everything, that there are gaps in our scientific knowledge and, in fact, that we are sometimes completely in the dark. We cannot know everything. We cannot challenge those who have taken decisions and, at the same time, believe that we should wait. In this case, the precautionary principle must prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can probably put the underlying situation right in the longer term, but it shows how wrong it is to jump to conclusions at a very early point.

We can probably do something to recompense that, but you cannot give back a life.</p>

<p class="contents">A simple comparison with a few other countries makes it clear that we could be better. I would just like to refer once again to the example of the United States. Since the 1980s, huge efforts have been made there with regard to research, there is a reporting obligation and there is a centralised disease control authority in Atlanta that has extensive powers for direct intervention when such an epidemic occurs. In Germany, on the other hand, we have two Federal Ministries that are responsible and these ministries clearly could not agree on who was to take responsibility. We also have regional ministries that want to, and must, assume responsibility, but that are clearly overstretched. We have communication problems between laboratories and politicians. Thus, it is wholly unclear when science is to intervene, when disease control measures are to be announced, and when political action is to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand why a Minister, on receiving the information that the cucumbers are responsible, would issue a warning accordingly, but where is the detailed coordination? Where is the genuine decision-making authority? It seems to me – and I say this very cautiously – that action was taken just as prematurely with the bean sprouts as with the cucumbers. There is something of a discrepancy between scientific findings and political action.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting back to what we need to do: we need to establish a reporting obligation throughout Europe, define central laboratories and set up a central body within the European Union with the decision-making power in the event of an outbreak of such a disease. I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely grateful to Mr Liese for mentioning the antibiotics problem. Here, too, we are faced with problems that we are actually already aware of. However, because we shy away from entering into a debate with the medical sector, the pharmaceuticals industry and the intensive livestock farming sector – there is a great deal to be addressed here – we are also not being as consistent as we need to be in the way we deal with the matter of antibiotics resistance. EHEC and antibiotics resistance are both major problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers. So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection. In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders.</p>
<p class="contents">After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear. If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited. As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food. However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety. Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from.</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic. In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside. The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy. Our food must be safe. However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks. The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now. These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis. While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany – statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible – mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium. Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o’clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use. Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused. To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the ‘mad cow’ and dioxin affairs. One such solution should also be found now.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission and Germany, in particular, have not been managing this crisis in the best possible way. We are facing a massive human tragedy involving the loss of many lives, and a threat to the lives of thousands of others. This is also a crisis of consumer confidence in staple foods, with economic and social consequences that are hard to foresee.</p>
<p class="contents">Society expects a rapid response from the national and Union authorities that sheds light on the causes of this crisis, along with effective action. However, it is also necessary to minimise the disastrous consequences this is having on another group of innocent victims, namely, fruit and vegetable producers, as has been mentioned here today. These workers have been hastily and unfairly blamed, and have lost income and seen their futures seriously threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">Preventative action also needs to be taken as a matter of urgency so that similar situations do not happen again. One aspect of this is to increase the effectiveness of supervision and control mechanisms for antibiotics in animals, as I mentioned in the debate held here less than a month ago. Another area where action needs to be taken is the form of the new common agricultural policy (CAP), which we are in the process of reforming. It is vital that, in future, incentives be aimed at ensuring quality based on sustainable production methods, as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has been insisting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the meantime, no one is touching European vegetables, and this health crisis has turned into a social crisis and an economic crisis too, of course.

<p class="contents">Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability – the first point – it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any, or hardly any, proof.

We have a great deal which needs to be explained. We have to establish the source and cause of the outbreak, but we must also identify the source and cause of the false information about the outbreak which was spread in Europe and around the world – false and damaging information, which has done so much harm. We need to look very closely at the causes of the outbreak and, in particular, at industrial animal husbandry, where antibiotics are used on a massive scale. I agree with those who have just spoken about this. If antibiotics are used on such a large scale, it is no surprise that strains of bacteria arise which do not then respond to antibiotics. In my opinion, this intensive farming with the use of antibiotics should be greatly restricted in the European Union, and perhaps even stopped, and the damage which has been done should be repaired by those who caused it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it needs to be made clear who is to issue a warning and when, who is subsequently to take over responsibility for the warnings, and when the European Commission is to get involved. In Germany, the responsibility lies with 16 federal states and two ministries, which is too finely distributed for a European crisis. Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage. I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s. That is something that we now need to rectify as a matter of urgency.</p>

Firstly, I would like to point out that more than 15 days after the first cases had been reported and more than a month after the first instances of contamination had occurred, the European early warning and response units have still been unable to identify the real cause of the contamination. This has caused a great deal of harm, as has already been mentioned here. Secondly, it is important to remember that this is a serious, but not isolated, case of a lack of food security in the EU. I would remind you of the recent debate that we had here on the problem of dioxins.</p>
<p class="contents">These cases are inseparable from a common agricultural policy (CAP) that promotes intensive, export-oriented production models, instead of encouraging, as is necessary, local production and consumption, which could ensure much more effective traceability and, consequently, greater food security.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to compensate European producers for the damage that they are suffering, and not just those in the geographical area of the outbreak of infection. The CAP is a common policy, so this should be done through EU measures rather than just national ones, given the obvious inequalities that this would create. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it is not bean sprouts. The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries’ economies. What we do know is that there is something very strange about this outbreak. There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus. It is affecting unusual groups of people in a way not normally associated with E coli outbreaks. It has already struck far more people and in far more places than a normal outbreak and, unlike in normal outbreaks, it has not been rapidly traced to one or two food suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries – including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel – have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can imagine the anxiety of those taken ill, and we can only lament the deaths that have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole affair must force us to take a very rigorous approach to European public health problems and make us see that it is vital to work with researchers and the pharmaceutical industry in order to respond effectively to such a situation and also to give ourselves the means to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The bacterium costs lives, too many lives. It also costs our farmers a lot of money and dangerously undermines consumer confidence in our agricultural products and agri-food industry, which are still undoubtedly the safest and most strictly controlled in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">After cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce and bean sprouts, what will be the next victim of this health hysteria? There are serious economic consequences for farmers. The fact is, the alert system worked very well. The problem is that the Commission has neither the resources nor the opportunity to check whether information given by a Member State is true or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Bacteria circulate more quickly today than they did in the past. Lessons will have to be learnt, in communication terms, from the way in which this health crisis has been managed. Feedback will have to be given. Additional checks will no doubt have to be envisaged before the conclusions of a national or regional health agency can be taken as read.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this crisis totally justifies a vital improvement in the traceability of foodstuffs. The obligation to indicate the country of origin or the place of provenance unfortunately only applies in a limited number of cases. It should be extended to a larger number of foodstuffs. In the event of a health crisis, this would make it possible to identify the sources of contamination and to warn the consumers concerned more quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, our sympathy goes out to all those who have died or are lying in a hospital bed. This situation is dramatic and it is also unacceptable. It is unacceptable that three weeks after the outbreak of this crisis, we still do not know exactly where the pathogen that caused the crisis originated. That really should not happen in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several lessons we need to learn from this. Firstly, we need to look for the source and examine whether improper practices are still present in the food production sector or in the food supply chain. We have legislation that has been in place for 20 years, and the standards and codes of practices in the European Union are quite stringent, but it is clear that we are still vulnerable when it comes to foodstuffs. There still seem to be gaps and shortcomings and we need to learn from this once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic. Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way. We clearly need more Europe. That has already been said by other Members here. When any regional or national authority issues a warning for the whole of Europe, it can only be a disaster. In my view, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has done a good job, as far as I can see, but we need a better, modern reporting obligation for determining the causes and also a better system for informing the general public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we still have no concrete evidence about the reason for this spread and all scenarios should be considered, including potential negligence or unintentional entry of the bacteria into the food chain. How the bacteria were actually created is a different case; research and findings are needed urgently. However, I would also like to make a special point about the way current events have been communicated to the general public by German and European authorities, with the serious consequences we know for the fruit and vegetable sector, not only in Spain, but in all our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time that we have had a problem relating to food safety in Germany. I propose that the Commission should help the German authorities to enhance the traceability and control of the German procedures, and similar measures should be taken concerning the procedures in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency is needed to maintain consumer confidence.

Did this outbreak start in Germany or some other Member State? Rumours can be destructive and can even help spread an outbreak. There are still many unanswered questions surrounding this outbreak. The only sure thing is that most Member States have reported cases of the bacteria. To date, we have 22 deaths in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This outbreak demonstrates the importance of cross-border cooperation in the field of preventive health. It also brings into play the importance of having a European agency such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to monitor, collaborate and inform the Member States. We are relatively lucky in the UK to have had only three reported cases, but that is today: tomorrow, things could change, and we must be vigilant. In addition to finding the cause of the outbreak, we need to keep the public informed and therefore protected. ECDC is publishing daily updates.</p>
<p class="contents">Through cooperation, we can control this outbreak. If our citizens are informed, they stand a better chance of avoiding infection. Above all, we need to be calm and measured in our response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lost lives clearly cannot be put at the same level as economic problems; that is not what we are doing. I would like to stress, however, that it is not by pointing the finger at the causes – which then turn out not to be the causes – that we will solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If someone is murdered and an innocent person is put in prison for it, that provides no comfort or justice for the murder that has been committed. Yet we are doing just that: in an extremely serious situation, with a public health crisis and food safety at stake, we are pointing the finger at people who then turn out not to be guilty, thus causing further victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish growers have already taken to the streets and today, in about 40 minutes’ time, direct growers in Italy, too, will be demonstrating in the streets in Milan and the province of Latina, offering consumers fresh cucumbers and other fruit and vegetables to show that they are healthy foods and important for a healthy, balanced diet. We would not wish to strike German consumers the extra blow of depriving them of foods that are absolutely essential for their diet and their health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out some data that should give the relevant authorities, in particular, cause for serious thought when they put out certain information that causes alarm, fear and panic. Data supplied by Eurobarometer and gathered by Coldiretti in Italy show that in a food emergency, 43% of Italians, for example, avoid the foods they have heard about for a certain length of time, whereas 13% cut them out of their diet for good. We must therefore try to think about what we say and how we influence people’s eating habits.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission, therefore, if it does not think there is a case for triggering the European emergency clause and bringing forward the discussion on financial compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same cannot be said of the German authorities. The least that we can say is that there is chaos when it comes to communications, and that, perhaps, is putting it mildly. The fact that Germany’s health minister yesterday thought it unnecessary to travel to a Health Council in Luxembourg where the main topic on the agenda was this serious infection crisis shows that he has absolutely no idea what Europe is really about and that he is ignorant, does not recognise the problems, or is still busy with internal party political crises.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I must observe – and Mr Dalli said it himself – that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them. Furthermore, the fact that it took three days for these experts to get into Germany is a scandal, and one that we must be critical of in this House. At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to you quite clearly – if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case. Cucumbers from Spain and other countries did have EHEC bacteria on them. They were not the bacteria behind this outbreak, but it takes a while to find that out.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, that is not the point, either. Those of you who understand the European Union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works. You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named. You can also look that up easily in the legislation. For me, the important question is what will happen in future? In the future, we need to consider whether slurry use can continue. Could there still be production methods that are unacceptable? Who, in the European Union, actually monitors what, when and with what result this is documented, and who has what obligations in that regard?</p>

The situation is serious. There is an urgent need to get help to those affected and to take all possible steps to prevent the further spread of this infection. All necessary resources must be made available to our research institutes and hospitals.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapid action has been the order of the day since this pathogen emerged. However, the uniform, Europe-wide crisis management right down to a common language regime has not been characterised by professionalism. The pathological hunt to locate the contamination site led to premature accusations of guilt all round, and these arguments led to days of negative headlines and total uncertainty on the part of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">For the producers affected, this gave rise to dramatic losses of income that threatened their very survival. Blameless, regionally-produced products, too, are no longer selling. In Austria alone, sales of fresh vegetables have fallen by 75%. Growers of vegetables are being faced with these losses of income right in the middle of their peak harvesting season. The uncoordinated way in which consumers have received information in the course of this event once again raises the demand for universal and cross-sector origin marking and efficient monitoring on the principle of ‘marked and checked at source’.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers have the right to know where products come from. This applies equally to shop shelves and to restaurants and catering.</p>
<p class="contents">All the authorities now need to quickly eliminate the prejudices against fresh vegetables, re-invigorate sales of fresh vegetables and breathe new life into trade with third countries. The EHEC situation has thrust local vegetable growers into an existential crisis completely out of the blue and through no fault of their own. The Commission must make it possible for there to be compensation for losses, be it through a European agricultural fund, the European crisis fund or measures to promote sales.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese is absolutely right to say that human life is irreplaceable and that every death is one death too many. However, it is also absolutely our duty not to leave our producers high and dry when it is through no fault of their own that they have found themselves in this situation that threatens their very survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Spanish horticultural sector has estimated the economic losses caused by the fatal errors in communication, which we now know about, at EUR 200 million a week. I wish to emphasise the responsible attitude demonstrated by this sector and its total cooperation with my country’s authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, traceability to the origin worked, but how much time was lost in directing attention to the origin, focusing on agricultural production, whereas other forms of contamination, such as handling or distribution at the point of destination, were dismissed? Why did the Commission echo the hurried information from Germany?</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a lack of coordination, Commissioner, and the unilateral closure of borders to Spanish products is proof of the failure to monitor the crisis within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to activate immediately all the necessary mechanisms to compensate the damage to the Spanish and European sector, both financially and in terms of consumer image. In the long term, however, it remains to be seen which other measures are adopted in this respect.</p>

There have been some less measured comments in the Chamber because of the impact on human lives, and indeed the add-on impact on producers and consumer confidence. This is a most serious food crisis, and Mr Dalli has acknowledged that. We know it is regionalised in a certain part of the European Union, but it is not a German-only problem; it is an EU problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The system exists to find the cause and deal with the consequences, but I am afraid that not all parts of the system have been adequately put in place, and I have some questions in relation to timing. I understand that the rapid alert was given on 22 May 2011: I am concerned that the European experts went into Germany only on Sunday, 5 June. Why such an incredible time lapse? I think that this needs to be looked at.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, under Article 55 of Regulation 178/2002, the possibility of creating a crisis unit. Everyone who spoke said this is a crisis, and Mr Dalli acknowledges it is a crisis. It is one which is growing rather than declining, and I would suggest it is now time for the EU to invoke that regulation and put such a crisis unit in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The thing that has been most distressing has been the virtual ‘naming and shaming’ of vegetables and then declaring them not guilty. This has shattered consumer confidence not just in fresh fruit and vegetables, but in our system of food safety and control. Commissioner Dalli, I know that you are nodding in agreement, and I welcome that, but I do believe that now is the time to set up the crisis unit, and I would like you to comment on that in your closing remarks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This aggressive bacteria seems unstoppable. Between mid-May and noon yesterday, 1 733 people were infected, while 23 patients died a torturous death. The situation in the clinics is extremely fraught. Intensive care beds are running out, and blood plasma is needed urgently. No end is in sight. The people of my home area fear new cases every day.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is a question of courage and a sense of responsibility to warn about every even potential carrier of this bacterium. Various foodstuffs have been analysed, but it has not been found. My understanding of high grade foodstuffs is that they are healthy and that they are placed on the market subject to monitoring. I am presuming that glaring errors have been made in this regard, and once again, we are finding out that there are loopholes. However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme. In all the understandable panic, there must not, under any circumstances, be a witch-hunt, as that would drive many hard-working farmers throughout Europe to the wall. It therefore needs to be clear to everyone that we in the European Union need to show solidarity with one another and stand ready to provide mutual assistance in the event of emergencies. In other words, all the medical experts must sit down together, and economic assistance needs to be provided to those who innocently find themselves facing financial disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified. It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well. I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system – which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours – was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation – which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis – was met.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause. As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen. The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span>, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Certainly, we do not know the causes, but we do know some things that we have to spell out: there has been negligence in political action and negligence by the German Federal Government; it cannot act as if Hamburg were a city state on another continent.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mrs Merkel and her Ministry of Health had translated the arrogance with which they frequently address other States into diligence and efficiency, some of the things that happened would not have done so. That negligence has had criminal consequences for one State, namely Spain, and for its most important sector, agriculture. It has ruined thousands of people and small businesses, and has discredited the economy for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you to go to the Council today and ask for full compensation for those affected, because we cannot ask for life for those who have died. And I ask for the control systems to be reviewed. And for Mrs Merkel to accept responsibility. And I ask her for less arrogance and more diligence. And that she be held responsible for the damage she has caused. She cannot ignore the fact that Hamburg is in her country. She cannot ignore her responsibilities. She cannot attribute blame to a Federal State when she herself should be held responsible for the damage caused.</p>

I thank the Commissioner for his willingness to communicate with us at this point, but the communication that has taken place thus far, including by the Commission, has been a disgraceful failure. It was days after the outbreak of the crisis when the Commission held a press conference. The genie was already long out of the bottle by that stage, however, and the wildest imaginable stories were already circulating in the media. The Commissioner spoke about a possible source on Dutch cucumbers, even though more than 200 tests had already shown days earlier that that was not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that the technical side of the story has worked. Rapid alert, tracking and tracing have all worked. There is also the communications side of the whole issue, though, and that side has been abysmal, first of all in Germany, of course, with so many different institutes, authorities and even a number of ministers all giving out different signals. There was a minister for agriculture who made a senseless comment that people should ‘stop eating uncooked produce altogether’, even though she had no authority for the matter. I assume that you are talking to Germany in this regard, as there needs to be a fundamental investigation into how everything could have been handled so shoddily.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that you will soon argue the case with the agriculture ministers for an emergency fund, to be paid for from the surplus still available in the agriculture budget. Just as we did with dairy products when a deep crisis broke out in that sector, we need now, too, to call that surplus into use. In my home country alone, this sector is suffering to the tune of EUR 80 million a week even though the source of the outbreak is elsewhere, and the result is that healthy businesses are now on the verge of collapse. That cannot be the European Union’s intention. I take it that you will take this strong signal from Parliament with you to the Agriculture Ministers’ Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it is essential to review and improve our system of surveillance and monitoring. We need to be ready for situations which are even more dangerous.

The citizens of the European Union need the European institutions to be effective in many areas, including in prevention of the spread of every kind of disease in every part of the European Union, and this is understandable. However, above all else, preventative agencies working in the area of health and food safety should be ready with ways of preventing panic.

<p class="contents">We did not manage to prevent panic this time. This has resulted in losses running into millions, and Polish farmers have also been affected. The price of vegetables on the Polish market fell by two thirds in the course of a week. Every day, vegetable producers incur losses of PLN 2 million. Several months ago, we raised the alarm concerning swine flu. The European institutions did not pass muster then and were not able to prevent panic from spreading across the European Union.

<p class="contents">It is not right that the German authorities failed to defer, from the start, to the European Union in a tragedy that has transcended their borders ever since the end of their first press conference, when they wrongly blamed Spanish cucumbers. It is not right to make unsubstantiated accusations, to communicate uncertain information and to cause such confusion. It is not right that all the principles of crisis communication have been flouted in this way. Because of this, the crisis has turned into hysteria. These rumours and witch-hunts fuelled by those same authorities have caused enormous harm; they indicate a lack of responsibility. The bond of trust between consumers and producers has once again been broken.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us ensure that this tragedy is not a terrible waste, too, by learning important lessons from it: we need to decide on the best ways of implementing a robust cross-border traceability system and establish a European communication unit and a crisis management unit. If we do not learn the lessons of this failure quickly, 23 people will have died for nothing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not have time to react to every single interesting comment that was made, but I can assure you we have taken note of the feeling expressed in this House. Today, as I said, I will be attending the Council of Agriculture Ministers. Tomorrow, I will be in Berlin to participate in a coordination meeting between the food safety sector and the health sector, together with the experts we have in place there.</p>
<p class="contents">My main preoccupation is to stop hospitalisations: that is my first and foremost objective. I am concentrating on mobilisation and on speeding up the identification of the cause of the outbreak. We set up the crisis unit on 30 May 2011 and, at Commission level, we were fully mobilised at that point. My public health department mobilised the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the ECDC has activated its crisis mode in order to make scientific assessments as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission immediately asked the ECDC to carry out a scientific assessment. In daily meetings with Member State experts, the Commission has coordinated assessment measures: the establishment of common case definitions, case reporting, patient questionnaires, sharing perspectives on treatment, and hygiene advice to the public are some of the outputs we have achieved in a very short time span.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be very careful and we have to keep everything in perspective. It is easy for all of us to sit in judgment with hindsight and to make statements, rather than being in the eye of the storm when a crisis is happening. We have to be careful in our statements and criticism because, while insisting – as I do – that decisions be made on the basis of well-sustained evidence, we should not terrify those who are called upon to take risky decisions, sometimes in very difficult situations, fearing that afterwards they will be put in the dock and everyone will pass judgment on their decisions. I think this aspect of situation management is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for checking and controlling the information that is circulating. We have a system in Europe that allows for fast communication and, in order to have fast communication, we apply the subsidiarity principle – looking to the lowest possible level as the base from which communication should start. We have to be careful because, if we begin to add layer upon layer of controls and checks to verify the information circulating, then we will defeat the purpose of speed, and in circumstances where health is concerned, and where life and death is sometimes at stake, speed is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards information, we are supplying continuous information as we receive it. In this respect, we at the Commission agree that coordinated and rapid communication is an essential element of risk management. If you remember, in 2009-2010, as a result of our H1N1 experience, we set up a system to coordinate public health communication, and our EU Health Security Committee has a network of communicators. We will need to involve regional actors more effectively in this process, as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO). As recently as yesterday, I was on the phone with Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the WHO, about this aspect of coordinating information and ensuring full coordination before any communication takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">We will study what happened, and undertake closer investigations and analyses. Once we are confident that the contamination has been stopped, we will concentrate on what happened in the information sector, with regard to investigation protocols and in terms of coordination across the board when the crisis occurred, and we will then reflect on whether we need more tools and closer European coordination. That may be part of the answer but, as you say, it is going to involve a lot of discussion both here in Parliament and also at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of compensation, this will be discussed this afternoon in the AGRI Council, and I am sure that my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, is doing his utmost to identify and develop ways and means of compensating our farmers who have been suffering as a result of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumers’ faith in the diligence of food producers and, not least, in the professional operation of supervisory authorities, was shaken once more. In a well-functioning rule of law state, consumers have good reason to believe that the food that ends up on their tables and that they give to their children is safe to consume. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that this faith has been shaken. It is enough to think of the poisoned tomato scandal in Hungary, but we might mention January’s dioxin-contaminated pork scandal in Germany as well. All these sad events call our attention time and again to the fact that the state must strengthen regulatory inspections, and act against all deficiencies or abuses in the strictest possible manner. It is, after all, absolutely impossible to expect citizens to carry out this work instead of the state. We cannot get trained to become food scientists or install laboratories capable of inspecting food in our homes. Instead, the right solution is to impose the strictest sanctions against those who violate regulations, and not be afraid to even shut down businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the immediate future, the EU and the Member States should focus their resources on finding the source of the contamination in order to end the outbreak and the deaths that it has caused, and to restore consumer confidence in the food chain, as without this, it is impossible to put an end to our farmers’ desperation. In order to do this, the European Food Safety Authority and the Member States’ health ministers need to work together. This has been slow to happen due to Germany’s disastrous management of the crisis. The EU cannot neglect its farmers in this situation. It needs to create a mechanism to compensate them rapidly for the massive negative impact of this crisis, which is already jeopardising the survival of many farms. The absolute priority is consumer protection, but we need to correct our procedures. It is vital to establish who is to issue a warning, and when and how they should issue it, in order to prevent the information chaos we have been witnessing. This has had disastrous consequences, while the source of the problem has not even been identified. We also need to see clear action from bodies of a pan-European nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This abominable situation must not be repeated; we need to learn the lessons from it quickly in order, in future, to be able to more quickly detect where the cause is and to communicate in a more efficient and more coordinated manner. This area, communications and the poor consultation between the Member States in that regard, has been a pitiful failure. A very great deal of economic damage has been wrought that would have been perfectly preventable if more care had been taken with communications in the crisis. The operators affected are entitled to damages. We are therefore arguing the case for the establishment of a European emergency fund. Additional national support measures are like a sticking plaster for a broken arm, and, moreover, hardly provide evidence of serious European solidarity. As Commissioner Dalli said here this morning, this is not a national problem for Germany; it is a European problem. Let us therefore also tackle it in a European context. This crisis is also an opportunity to make clear to European citizens that Europe will not leave the victims of a public health disaster of this kind in the lurch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bean sprouts are presumed to be the source of the infection and to have caused the deaths of 20 people in Europe and a further 300 or so serious cases diagnosed in Germany alone, but the latest test results on bean sprout samples have been negative. The immediate consequence of the outbreak has been a noticeable drop in fruit and vegetable consumption throughout Europe. Although, at the moment, no precise figures are yet available on the extent of the losses in the European market-gardening sector following the E coli crisis, the economic damage caused to this sector will clearly not be negligible. Given that I have already tabled a parliamentary question on this issue, I take the opportunity in this Chamber to stress the need for the Union to commit itself to supporting European producers in this sector with instruments appropriate to the seriousness of the crisis. I also draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that it should consider introducing measures to improve the preservation of fruit and vegetables and increase controls on their packaging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The information being received from vegetable producers is disturbing. Dealers are recording zero interest from customers in buying cucumbers, tomatoes and other vegetables. They are incurring huge financial losses because they are being forced to throw away entire deliveries or let them go for significantly less than the price they paid for them. Producers are turning away from growing vegetables, which involves changing production to something else, and this, in turn, means worker layoffs. If the forecasts are going to continue to be disturbing and we do not find the source of the infection, businesses will be forced to stop trading because of a lack of liquidity. I think the European Union does have administrative instruments which allow it to react quickly to such cases, so we should consider how to improve the system to make it more effective. Since we do have these tools, we should find the source of the infection as soon as possible, so as not to expose vegetable producers to further losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest developments indicate that the only damage to occur was the financial loss for European farmers. We must not forget, however, that the highest price that we paid for this epidemic was in the dozens of victims across many Member States of the European Union. It is our duty to take action so that similar errors and outbreaks do not occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European consumers have become used to having confidence in the food which they find on supermarket shelves precisely because European producers are obliged to comply with the highest quality standards in the world. However, this crisis has highlighted that the European system is not infallible and that we are extremely vulnerable. Indeed, we must now turn our thoughts primarily to the victims. What has happened is a tragedy. At the same time, we must also think about the support measures which are required to prevent the loss of thousands of farming jobs and, above all, the destruction of an entire sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in fact, a crime by international companies, which are poisoning the food chain and sacrificing human life and the health of the workers in order to increase their profits. The new food epidemic illustrates that the EU neither can nor will protect human life and public health because, as a transnational union of monopolies, it has promised to serve and protect the profits of capital, not the lives of the workers. The sole objective of the unsubstantiated accusations – for which there is no scientific basis – made by the German authorities against small and medium-sized holdings in the Member States in the south of the EU, which the EU hastily adopted, thereby causing very serious damage to farmers in those countries, was to cover up and conceal the anti-grassroots and dangerous nature of the CAP and the responsibilities of the EU, the bourgeois governments and the monopoly groups, which have no hesitation in feeding the workers highly toxic foods which are dangerous to their health, provided that they maximise the profits of capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, we need to reflect on the causes of this outbreak and the factors that have stood in the way of fighting it. Are there too many antibiotics in cattle fodder? Is it the case that the over-intensive nature of agriculture does not do us any favours? To what extent do we need better labelling and tracing? These are important questions, especially now, when the review of the common agricultural policy is on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it has also become clear that there are substantial weak points in the European crisis management system for crises in foodstuffs. Particularly given the nature of this situation where, as well as the federal government, there are also two competent ministries per region, there is too much fragmentation and too great a lack of clarity in the approach towards, and communications regarding, the crisis. In crises of this kind, it is of crucial importance, both for consumers and for foodstuff producers, that a European coordination cell be set up as quickly as possible to look after both communications and the coordination of the scientific investigation. This will enable quicker and more efficient investigation into the causes of an outbreak by also exploiting the expertise of other European researchers and laboratories to the full. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title7"></a><a name="creitem7"></a>

The immediate tangible impact on the ground will, of course, depend on the political willingness of the Member States to exploit the new opportunities or otherwise. We are not imposing anything. We are only making things possible, specifically, the application of a principle that we, Parliament, have been arguing for for a number of years, namely, the ‘polluter pays’ principle, the internalisation of external costs.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of old stagers amongst us know that we have already been fighting hard for this since 2006, when Mrs Wortmann-Kool led the previous review. This was followed, in 2008, by a Commission proposal which we have since been working on for three years. Those who have followed this dossier from close quarters know how laborious a job it was to get to this result. It is a compromise, a compromise between the institutions, but also a compromise between the institutions that, for instance, was backed by the minimum possible majority in the Council, and that also has its opponents here in Parliament. Some people think it is not ambitious enough, while others believe that it goes much too far. It is to the credit of the negotiating team and, specifically, of the shadow rapporteurs who, together with myself, Council staff and the Commission, reached this fragile equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask all of you to support this package that we have achieved as a step in the right direction. It provides the Member States, for the first time, with the ability to also charge for noise and air pollution over and above the existing infrastructure charges which, in addition, are not consistently levied everywhere at the moment, and in a way that could stimulate the likes of fleet renewal. At the same time, it gives the Member States the ability to greater vary their charging depending on the time of day at which a lorry uses a road. This gives the governments control options in order to improve mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is also a strong commitment – the strongest possible commitment – on the part of the Member States to reinvest the income generated into the transport system in order to make it more sustainable and to reinvest at least 15% of the income into the trans-European transport network. At the same time – and this was also an important issue for the European Parliament – there is clarity about the transparency requirement. Member States have to specify what level of income they obtain from the charges and what they are going to do with that money in order to bring about a better transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">The package is also due to be applied to a larger part of the fleet, specifically, all vehicles of 3.5 tonnes or above. That is the principle. That is the standard. This is what has been agreed. It is also to be applied to the entire motorway network. We put a strong emphasis on the importance of the interoperability of the system. This will mean one little box per goods vehicle to cross the whole of Europe, rather than 25 or 26. That is cast in stone in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have one more point to make, and it concerns the correlation tables. There has been quite some discussion about this. The solution that we came up with, taking the form of a number of declarations from the three institutions, would seem adequate to avoid setting a precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Eurovignette is no miracle solution. We will not solve the mobility problem completely on the back of it, of course not. It is, however, an important part of a solution to bring about a more sustainable transport system. Cost incentives will make up an important element of this, but we will also have to do much more. What it is, though, is a step in the right direction and it is for that reason that I and those who worked with me are asking for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very glad that we are now ahead of adopting a directive which will clearly improve the quality of life of European citizens. As such, I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that we have succeeded in reaching an agreement with the European Parliament on the Eurovignette Directive. The objective of the proposal concerning tolls imposed on heavy goods vehicles for using certain infrastructures is to set the charges used in transportation correctly, so that they reflect more accurately the actual costs of air and noise pollution, traffic congestion and climate change effects caused by heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that commercial road transport is one of the determining economic sectors of modern societies. It is also a fact that the extent of problems that can be associated with road transport, such as air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion, are becoming ever more severe. This is why innovative and professional policy measures, such as promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles or developing route planners, are playing an increasingly large role. As a result of measures that aim to internalise external costs, economic efficiency is likely to increase and negative environmental effects will decrease. The fair road charge system proposed in the Eurovignette Directive will allow us to use our scarce resources in a more sustainable manner. This measure is also very important in connection with the Commission’s recently published White Paper, the ‘Road map to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system’.</p>
<p class="contents">The measure is the first step on the road leading towards the internalisation of external costs of all transport methods. According to the view of the Council, this proposal is one of the most important measures in the area of transport. We know that Parliament agrees with us on this matter. We have worked very hard together to reach the compromise. This is why the Hungarian Presidency would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, in particular, for being prepared to cooperate constructively with the Council and for making a committed effort to achieve success. The last open question of the negotiations was related to the correlation tables. The Presidency was pleased with the solution found for this issue, and I would like to read the respective statement of the Hungarian Presidency, which is supported by the next Polish, Danish and Cypriot Presidencies. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid any misinterpretation or misunderstanding, let me read it out in English: ‘It is hereby declared that the agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament in the trialogue of 23 May 2011 concerning the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, Eurovignette, does not prejudge the outcome of interinstitutional negotiations on correlation tables’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(HU)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an extremely important issue, one that will clearly influence the everyday lives of our citizens. Therefore, we welcome the agreement reached between these two institutions. I believe that in the area of transport policy, this is one of our most important results during the Hungarian Presidency, and we are awaiting tomorrow’s vote with optimism, hoping that the majority of representatives will support this directive. Thank you once more to all those who helped create this compromise, not only the rapporteur, but also the shadow rapporteurs, as well as our legal professionals, for helping to find a solution for the difficult matter of correlation tables. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is part of a wider strategy to internalise the external costs of transport in all modes to get transport prices right. I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for unblocking this file in the Council. The Hungarian Presidency skilfully negotiated with a very narrow majority in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui. Together with the shadow rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, he managed to significantly improve the text at second reading. I look forward to Parliament adopting this directive for two main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to achieve our goals of a more sustainable green transport system and thus implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The directive will authorise Member States to charge tolls on lorries not only for infrastructure costs, as is the case now, but also for noise and air pollution. It will also allow more efficient varying of tolls to ease congestion during peak hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at a time of scarce public funding, the charging for external costs provided by the new directive will generate revenues and make new financial resources available for transport infrastructure. The Commission supports this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted your declaration on the correlation table. I fully sympathise with you on this issue. On behalf of the Commission, I will also make a formal statement:</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt to the EU directive and that they communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation in the interests of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency, and to assist in the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in a spirit of compromise, and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with the relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice. It will inform Parliament within 12 months of the adoption of this agreement in plenary and produce a report at the end of the transposition period on practice in the Member States, in order to draw up for themselves – and in the interests of the Union – their own tables illustrating as far as possible the correlation between this directive and the transposition measures and to make them public.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent. The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding, together with Parliament and the Council, an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The majority of my group will also be endorsing this agreement, as it represents the first steps towards actually introducing the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and it does so in an intelligent way. First and foremost is the idea that there should be incentives to stimulate sustainability, not just higher duties. The arrangement of higher duties during peak hours, compensated for during off-peak hours, is now much better elaborated than in the Council position. That will mean that total toll levels remain the same. The exemptions for EURO V and EURO VI are also positive, as well as the fact that the Member States have again committed to regulating the interoperability of toll systems, as it is a thorn in our sides that that is still not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also finds the earmarking important. We would have wanted more of it, but it is definitely an important step, and in that I mean not only the percentage that will now be earmarked, but also the reporting obligation on the part of the Member States. Hopefully, that is a first step towards further earmarking of this money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The most important and trickiest point, for me, was earmarking. What will the Member States use the income from these charges for? Will they use them to make their transport economy more efficient? Are we going to oblige them to do so? We did not succeed in doing this. We thus did not achieve what we were hoping for in this regard. It is somewhat perverse that Member States are seeking to keep the way open for retaining this income, just as the external costs are also retained. With this charge, we really should be limiting external costs as far as possible and preferably reining them back to zero. Thus, the things that this money should actually be used for are the likes of improved infrastructure and research into cleaner goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue that continues to bother me, which is, if you have variable charging for peak hours, how do you tackle traffic jams if you do not treat all those responsible for causing them in the same way? This is an issue that we had in black and white at first reading, but the Council did not want to know. The efficiency of some of the things that we do is thus not 100%. What we do have here – and Mr Ertug has already pointed this out – is more transparency. The Member States have to produce a report stating how much income these charges generate and what they have done to improve the system. I thus hope that a discussion arises between the payers, the road freight sector and the government on the use of this money and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one of the positive elements. I am no enthusiast, but I did defend this in my group because we now have an important principle – the internalisation of external costs – incorporated into European legislation for the first time. That means that we can make a start on the process of charging for all external costs for all modes of transport in order to improve your economy along with your sustainability. The Commissioner included a number of measures in the White Paper for which this step is necessary. If we do not approve it, then we will also be stuck on a number of issues in the White Paper. It is quite rare, after all, that it is persistently so difficult to reach agreement in the Council – and, Madam President, I am not blaming the Hungarian Presidency of the Council here, it did its best. This is an important – and essential – first step in a long process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) will support the compromise agreement because many of the solutions that were worked out are, in reality, fine achievements. On the Council’s side, this compromise was very fragile, and it is understandable that some issues such as the scope of the directive or collection and distribution of the allocated funds to Member States were sensitive issues even up to the end of the talks. I believe that further compromise talks would lead to a worse result or would end in no result at all. The most important thing now is to continue forward, to implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle regarding the collection of road tax. The damage done to the environment must be compensated, and the infrastructure must be improved, and, as Mr Sterckx has stated, this is the first piece of legislation at European level where this principle has been incorporated. This principle and the taxes should be implemented in all Member States. Unfortunately, many states have not yet implemented the Eurovignette 1 infrastructure payments and, most likely, these same states will be very tardy in implementing Eurovignette 2. This distorts the market in haulage flows and, in fact, whereas the roads are maintained by payments by taxpayers in these Member States and the European Union taxpayers, the benefit is gained by third-country carriers, the infrastructure stays undeveloped, and external costs are not recovered. Let us hope for some willingness on the part of the Member States. Thank you</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transport policy of the Member States’ transport ministers consists of demanding a sustainable and forward-looking transport policy for the European Union every Sunday while doing everything under the sun during the week to actively prevent such a policy from being realised.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear, and that is that noise and exhaust gases are to the detriment of both people and nature. They give rise to costs, and those costs are currently borne by the taxpayers, rather than those responsible for the costs. Parliament’s proposal, which was already a very tame one and a difficult compromise between the countries at the centre of Europe and those on the peripheries, was still watered down even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, for example, the allocation of external costs became voluntary, rather than compulsory. Costs are not apportioned for all the deleterious consequences caused, only for a small number of factors. In the end, what remains of the allocation of costs amounts to little more than a couple of hot dogs and a beer for a whole leg of the journey. I find that very little. The arrangements apply only in a qualified way to goods vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes. Germany got its way with the 12-tonne proposal and in mountain areas, the only goods vehicles now subject to taxation are those that you do not even find there because they cannot get up the large inclines.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, Italy wanted to derail the whole thing on the basis of a bureaucratic detail. When it comes down to it, that is a prime example of how transport policy, sadly, is still not taken seriously enough. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will still vote in favour, as we want to take our place in a majority that at least rescues the principle of the charging of external costs for a future where more reasonable people occupy the role of transport minister in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Eurovignette’ is one of the directives that should enable road and rail transport gradually to be put on an equal footing. Rail transport has been disadvantaged for years in the EU’s Member States due to the fact that users have to pay to use transport routes. In the case of the road network, payments for using the infrastructure have so far been rather symbolic.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the matter in purely technical terms, disregarding any other factors, we discover that the highest category roads, in other words, motorways, expressways and category one roads, are best adapted to the operation of heavy goods vehicles. The directive does not go so far as to follow the logic outlined above and set the highest fees for the lowest category roads, in other words, local roads. On the contrary, it focuses only on charging for some external costs, based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and only in the case of the highest category roads, in other words, motorways, expressways, category one roads and dual-carriageways.</p>
<p class="contents">The payments should include as few exemptions as possible, and should apply to the so-called external costs of road transport, including noise and, above all, emissions. I am frankly curious as to how the individual states will justify their unwillingness to introduce payments, at least under Table 1, which is a very watered-down version of what genuine environmentalists want.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these conflicts between logic and the version of the recommendation discussed here, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left supports the position of the rapporteur.</p>

As you know, the transport sector plays a key role in guaranteeing mobility and socio-economic development in Europe and, in order to address the challenges of economic growth and sustainability, it is necessary to improve transport sector infrastructure. We are all concerned about the effects of climate change, environmental conservation and various issues relating to health and social well-being, which are inseparable from the rational use of transport. I agree that applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle, as well as trying to safeguard the public interest, results, and must result, in measures primarily aimed at reducing environmental pollution, noise pollution, damage to the countryside, and social costs that arise due to poor health, because these generate substantial economic costs that are borne by the public at large, and thus by Europe’s citizens. It is good that in the area of transport, we are finally striving to apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Undoubtedly, this will give Member States additional possibilities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means that a better transport-demand-management instrument can be developed. However, I still believe that the instruments we are discussing today, which will be adopted in the near future, are not exactly adequate and are only economically beneficial for central transit European Union Member States, and are not entirely favourable, or significantly less favourable, for a large number of European Union Member States situated on the EU’s external borders. While basically welcoming the project, I believe that it would be worth fully re-evaluating this aspect, weighing it up again and only then adopting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was not easy to reach a compromise on this issue. That is also due to the fact that many people, including in this House, naturally do not agree with the result 100%. Some people were for it, others against. However, I would like to caution, from the outset, against the absurd situation whereby those who expect more link up with those who expect nothing and between them, they collapse the whole deal. I therefore hope that those who want costs to be internalised, and who even view this deal as very small progress, will support this compromise here.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, to a large extent, the view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), if not all the delegations, as we support the internalisation of the costs in all types of transport and we also support the use of resources to promote mobility. For us, that was one of the most important points. For us, it is not about making transport more expensive, as has just been claimed. Making transport more expensive does not make it more efficient. For us, this is about having a proper balance, so that those resources that are partly earned in relation to mobility are also invested in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important factor for us is interoperability. We do not want technically different charging systems across Europe – the idea of 27 different systems in future is unacceptable. I hail from a border area, and driving around the area for half an hour, you can face road tolls six times! That is not sustainable. The Council needs to be somewhat more flexible in this regard than it was in the past. We are also putting an emphasis on environmentally friendly goods vehicles. That means that we are also indicating a course of direction in this connection and, as has just been said, what we have introduced in this regard is not mandatory, with the result that those who favour the internalisation of costs are certainly not satisfied in that respect. I personally would also have liked this to have been mandatory in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had this debate so many times in this House. What do we want tomorrow? Do we want 27 different charging systems, or do we want all the Member States to work to the same rules? Or do we have to wait for further crises before we hear the call for action at European level again? For me, the Eurovignette, too, makes one thing clear, namely, that only Europe brings the answer. Different charges in individual Member States do not.</p>

I really think that, with this dossier, the rapporteur had so much resistance to overcome and that he thus managed to extract the absolute maximum possible from this entire issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, in this House, there is not really a majority for a real greening of transport. The first thing you have to do, then, is cope with that. It is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the Council to whom environmental interests are of no concern. It is equally clear that there is a majority in the Council who do not care about those who live and work along roadways and that there is a majority in the Council who support consumers purchasing any old junk, that has been transported far and wide, rather than high quality regional products. Given that situation, I would say that the very best result has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have the principle of external costs. That was a major step, a difficult step, facing all that resistance. We now have the ability, for the first time, to charge for exhaust gases. We have the ability to charge for noise. Of course, these are too limited and at far too low a level. If you look at the tables, this really is a drop in the ocean. It also proved possible to expand the corridors, so to speak, but we did not manage to put a tax on CO<span class="sub">2</span>. That is inexplicable. Transport is one of the largest producers of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in Europe and it is not charged for this. These points leave me really dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I endorse what has been said by other Members, who believe that we need to vote in favour of this, as otherwise, everything will go down the drain. I am voting in favour, with a heavy heart, and the thought that it is a good thing that we have come this far, but there must be much more progress in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, he describes how there is a need for incentive systems in order to give transport a more environmentally friendly form, and he also states that new sources of funding are needed, including, for example, in order to be able to work according to the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The Eurovignette Directive that we are debating today is one way that both of these points really can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a major Belgian effort, I believe we can say, begun under the Belgian Presidency of the Council with three important Belgians involved and, above all, because of the rapporteur, who succeeded in opening a door to the new routes. As it happens, I would have wished Belgium’s major effort greater success than what we now have.</p>
<p class="contents">What we actually managed to achieve is a small and weak compromise. Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent – 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks – it is really far too little. All national transport policy representatives say that we need considerable resources in order to be able to sustain our infrastructure networks. It is self-evident that the resources collected in this area should also be able to be invested there. That is a point on which we can all fail to be satisfied. The fact is that, in this connection, we have nonetheless taken a step in a direction in which we will be able to move further at a later date. That is also the reason why we intend to vote in favour of this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a tough struggle, though. It very definitely could have been the case that we ended up with nothing at all on the table, since a few Member States would have preferred to have nothing at all. This is therefore a success, and it will have our backing in the vote today.</p>

I support this principle because I consider it important from the perspective of the impact on the environment and human health, as well as the use of more methods of transport at national, regional and local levels. This is also in the interest of municipalities, which are often harmed by the negative impacts of transit traffic in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the continuing economic crisis and the increasing financial burden on transport operators, I also firmly believe that Member States should be given the option to spread out the introduction of charges for external costs over time, and according to individual types.

What is in this text? What does it say? Quite simply, it permits the Member States, on a voluntary basis, to use a ‘polluter pays’ system. Furthermore, the system is so restricted and so limited that, at the end of the day, the cost will only increase by around three to four cents. How can people think that a three or four cent mark-up will actually have an impact on modal shift? In other words, it is not a great success from an environmental point of view. This is what this famous principle of internalisation of external costs has become, after being put through the Council mill – sorry, Mrs Győri – after so much resistance, and despite the considerable efforts of the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we shall vote for this principle because it is an important one. It is a principle like others – we spoke earlier about the precautionary principle, which has made its mark in the European directives. We shall vote for this principle. It is just one principle; a whole battle remains to be fought, and we will continue to fight it in order to effect a genuine modal shift and to establish a greener transport system that protects people’s health and combats climate change more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most disconcerting fact, however, is probably that this Parliament sees this proposal as just a first step. It would be a first step, it should be noted, in the wrong direction that would mean that the Member States’ current right to implement this legislation would become an obligation, that the charge per kilometre would only rise and, above all, that car drivers would soon be next.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament talks of a single system among the Member States. However, adopting this proposal will mean that hauliers should get ready for a new box in the cabs of their lorries, with associated new taxes, of course. It is clear that, with this proposal, the European Parliament is strangling the life out of road transport as a result of the hysteria about the climate. The transport sector has it hard enough as it is, and is not expecting more taxes imposed by Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Precisely because of that, I think we should go through the ritual procedure. This dossier should really have gone to conciliation, though, because the correlation tables were not included in the final agreement. That could have been an ideal opportunity to reach a comprehensive agreement. Unfortunately, as has already been pointed out, that is not a mere detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘polluter pays’ principle is right, valid and agreed upon and, to avoid any doubt, I am in favour of the greening of transport. However, this instrument – Eurovignette – is too partial and ineffective, as well as unfair. At a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now, the only purpose of this decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is to make money, even if hardly any of this money is then used for transport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, a very complicated mechanism is being introduced, not least for calculating the amount to be charged. I am therefore critical of this dossier because I believe the way it penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States is unacceptable in this Europe of economic and territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The effectiveness of this instrument has not been demonstrated, and the modulation of transport flows creates problems for current and future financial planning because the charges are shifting and changing all the time. In this respect, I am told that the Member States are free to apply this extra charge or not. In the case of cross-border transport, however, we also depend on the decisions of others and so we need to reach an agreement. Therefore, I am convinced that an agreement reached at any price, at the expense of the haulage industry, cannot be considered a success. I really think there is still a very long way to go, especially as regards fair charging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, moreover, – and I take advantage of the fact that Mr Kallas is here – the Commission is placing in doubt the future central crossing of the Pyrenees in the future core network.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, with these problems of a railway alternative, the truth is that the agreement on the Eurovignette is now imposing even greater burdens on the transportation of products by road, which, in the peripheral countries, particularly in the south and in the east, are products of little or limited added value. In creating at this precise time – as a rumour, shall we say – the problem of adding even a few centimes – four cents do not appear anything at all to Mrs Durant – right now, when we have just passed through the crisis, or are still in mid-crisis in the case of the cucumber, and due precisely to these irresponsible and false accusations which are without proof, they have dealt a brutal blow to thousands of Spanish families, not just farmers, but also hauliers, because just these few centimes, on thousands of kilometres and products like the Spanish cucumber, will generate a major problem in terms of transporting them to the central market, which is precisely where these accusations originate.</p>
<p class="contents">No, Mr El Khadraoui, at the beginning, some initial accounts appeared, from which it was clear that, through the problems of the tax burden, there was an increase, and then they simply disappeared. I have always asked why those studies disappeared, but the truth is that it was worrying, so they have told us time and time again.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, I – and they also – would be prepared to make the sacrifice if the problems were to be resolved, important problems like congestion. However, in the current agreement, we have to say that the car does not seem to be included in the congestion. I am referring to major problems, such as the state of the infrastructure and the fact that things are improving, including in terms of reducing noise or other pollution. Even now, we know that it is not going to be possible because we do not have any alternatives at all to this.</p>

<p class="contents">‘Finally’ because, after very lengthy negotiations, we have reached a compromise and the ‘polluter pays’ principle is now genuinely beginning to take shape in this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">‘A bit of a shame’ because, even though the public finance situation in the Member States is complicated, we should have done everything in our power to reinvest the revenue collected for the benefit of, for example, trans-European transport network (TEN-T) priority projects. Mr Kallas, it will be up to the Commission to exercise close scrutiny. ‘A shame’, also, because I personally regret this minimum agreement where the desire to ease congestion is concerned: although the proposed agreement retains the off-peak concept, the methods by which the Member States must implement it are ‘weak’. The Commission must provide impetus on this issue as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, although the current directive stipulates that 3.5 tonne heavy goods vehicles must be included from 2012, we provide for the possibility of exempting them in the agreement. This is a harmful concession. Here too, Mr Kallas, it will be up to the Commission to play a key role. In short, although it is a modest compromise and a small step, it is a step nonetheless. We shall therefore vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be grateful to her if she could give me their names, although I do realise it would be a very, very short list. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work, although it is good that we can debate it, because it does contain a number of things that are extremely controversial. Lorries are to pay more, which means that the owners of transport firms are to pay more. This is a problem for firms during a crisis, and we cannot pretend otherwise. The question is: how will the money be spent? There is a real dilemma here, because if the money goes on yet more foolish projects of marginal groups, that will be a bad thing. It should be spent on the transport sector, on the development of transport, in which case the increases would be understandable. Otherwise, it is a kind of extortion, and this with the sanction of the European Union and the European Parliament’s stamp of approval. I think this is something which really is controversial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only environmentally friendly transport is too expensive. All of this is brought about by policy choices, and this directive will not change that. We have unfair competition. The tax privileges that heavy goods vehicles enjoy are not being curtailed. Every lorry causes 60 000 times as much damage as a car but, of course, it is not charged 60 000 times as much.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a mandatory rail toll within the European Union for decades. Every locomotive – whether it transports passengers or goods – must pay a rail toll for every kilometre it travels. On the roads, the toll is voluntary. It is capped. It mostly applies only on motorways and only to vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or more. On the railways, there is no limit. That is unfair, and it hinders the environmentally friendly railways while relieving the environmentally unfriendly roads.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we need a change in mobility in order to protect the climate. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance want to protect the climate and secure mobility for the future, and that is why we need fair competition.

If added charges are levied across Europe, the extra cost is ultimately filtered to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK Government is looking into HGV charges to bring us in line with Europe by 2015. We do not have a network of toll roads, nor do we lay additional charges on heavy goods vehicles after road tax. We face unfair competition from an increasing number of foreign trucks taking up more than their fair share of cross-border haulage. Foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but UK diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher, giving competitors a 15% advantage. However, under EU law, the UK cannot introduce a charge applicable only to foreign vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">If this directive expands its capabilities, any move by the UK Government to introduce HGV charges will be overshadowed by an unwanted indirect tax which the Commission also reserves the right to make obligatory in 2013. As the proposals relate to taxation, it should require unanimity at Council level, yet the legislation is being ushered in via the transport provision of Lisbon. It is an underhand way of introducing indirect taxation and should not be voted through by anybody with a democratic bone in their body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the European institutions, including the majority of our Parliament, have broadly supported this objective, as have almost all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity, then, that several Member States should have gone to great lengths, since 2008, to strip the proposal for a new Eurovignette directive of its content and to block this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, thanks to the tenacity of our rapporteur – and I should like to pay tribute here to Mr El Khadraoui – and of the shadow rapporteurs in their negotiations with the Council, we have a compromise before us at long last. Admittedly, this text is far less ambitious than the initial proposal, but it will enable us for the first time to implement the ‘polluter pays’ principle and to internalise external transport costs such as noise and CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that this Eurovignette is not just a tax but actually helps improve transport in Europe, the Member States are also encouraged to reinvest the revenues they collect in the modernisation of transport modes. Parliament has also successfully ensured that real progress is made on the interoperability of toll systems and that stronger incentives are given to use less polluting heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to remain consistent with the policy objectives that our institution has set itself, I sincerely hope that we will be able to endorse this compromise that is being proposed to us at second reading and thus pave the way for a more sustainable transport policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Another cause for satisfaction is that, with this report by Mr El Khadraoui – and I congratulate him on his tenacity – we are clearly expressing our desire to see the ‘polluter pays’ principle factored into the costs of road transport. We must remain vigilant, however: after three years of interinstitutional negotiations, we need to convince certain Member States that a policy for genuinely protecting the environment and an economic policy for successfully developing Europe’s rail network are both achievable thanks to the balance struck in this trialogue. We must also ensure that part of the revenue collected is actually allocated to infrastructure and trans-European transport network projects as indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also say how sorry I am that the binding nature of the ‘polluter pays’ principle has been left out of this compromise.

As many people have pointed out, the new rules merely contain calls for the Member States to use the revenue they receive to improve the environment and it is therefore important, just as Mr Sterckx said, that we here in the European Parliament continually remind our governments of the importance of following these recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is clearly not that our drivers and hauliers should pay for the noise and environmental impact if we do not, at the same time, introduce measures aimed at solving the problems, such as road treatment and other noise-attenuation measures. It is very important to prevent these charges simply becoming a new tax on heavy goods vehicles, as some Members here have pointed out. We must continue to work to improve the environment and reduce carbon dioxide levels in Europe, and it is therefore of central importance that we ensure that environmental charges are genuinely used to reduce and eliminate the environmental problems that arise.</p>

Ultimately, we now have the agreement to pass on the costs for the use of infrastructure, for noise and for air pollution to the carrier. I hope that many EU Member States will adopt this system, including the Netherlands. The Rutte government in the Netherlands is sensibly planning to pull ‘paying for mobility in a different way’ out of the hat. Those plans fit in well with today’s agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will bring forward proposals to also charge these costs to other means of transport in a phased manner. Of course, in so doing, account must be taken of the specific properties of each sector. Thus, inland shipping is not the only user of river water, something that is abundantly clear during these days of extreme drought. Agriculture, after all, currently has its sprinklers wide open.

<p class="contents">This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day. Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old ‘polluter pays’ principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette – which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures – will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation. Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures. The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis. If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party shall vote against this draft directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a modern and, at the same time, flexible framework for the application of the ‘polluter pays’ principle and a tool to moderate the congestion problems on major national motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely why the concerns expressed by many speakers about the imbalance in terms of the repercussions of its application in the regions of the Union and in the road transport sector – some of which are justified – need to be overcome. The aim of the compromise text, which is due in large part to Mr El Khadraoui, is to achieve gradual application of the charges in question, so that it is accompanied by gradual renewal of the European fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the way to overcome the objections and to pave the way for the acceptance and efficacy of the framework of the Eurovignette is to ensure, firstly, that the directive is applied strictly, transparently and quickly to all the Member States and, secondly, that all the revenue is channelled, as contributory resources, to transport infrastructures and is not used to plug well-publicised gaps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is, without doubt, also a good compromise, as it accommodates both sides, at least to a certain extent – both the carriers and the citizens, who have to suffer the noise and the exhaust gases. What are the advantages of this directive? For me, there are three.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the earmarking of the revenue from road charges for investment in improved transport infrastructure, which is in the public economic interest and provides increased safety and better transport routes. Secondly, there is the standardisation of collection, which lowers costs and prevents traffic congestion. Thirdly – and very importantly – there is the fact that it gives the Member States the ability and the freedom to factor costs such as noise and pollutant emissions into their road charges at a future point. These, then, are control mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who steer clear of rush hours and traffic jams will pay less and those who drive clean and quiet goods vehicles will enjoy lower costs. I hope that these incentives will mean that, in future, traffic jams will be avoided and goods vehicle fleets will be renewed. All in all, we are aware that not all wishes could be satisfied in the negotiations, but these positive aspects that we were able to achieve in the negotiations thanks to Parliament’s strength should lead to the desired positive effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that there is not too much bureaucracy in the implementation, as that would harm the whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The industry has been declining steadily over the last decade. Drivers with operating licences have fallen by 8% in the last three years. Foreign lorries now control 80% of cross-Channel business. In the last decade, 20% of domestic business has been lost to foreign hauliers. There is a large and growing resident population of foreign hauliers using foreign vehicles and paying only their own countries’ modest vehicle charges who are taking more and more domestic business.</p>
<p class="contents">It might appear that British hauliers are simply losing business as the result of competition, a favourite word in the EU lexicon. However, the competition is not fair competition. The British road fund licence is much greater and fuel tax exceeds that of other countries. Foreign hauliers work in the UK on fuel brought with them in 1 000-litre tanks. Whilst the proposed charges will apply to all vehicles, the burden on the British industry could be fatal. This directive must be resisted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I personally live on a stretch across which over 50 million tonnes of goods a year are transported, and I believe that, alongside people’s right to efficient transport, there is also a right for those living alongside to be protected from the impact and effects of this transport. This proposal is therefore certainly a small step in the right direction if it is used in such a way that investments are made to improve noise protection, provide modern heavy goods vehicles and, above all, to bring about modern rail networks and modern rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a positive thing that a supplemental rate can be charged in mountainous areas. I do find it particularly questionable, however, that we are planning to proceed in this area according to the principle of voluntary action, in other words, such that, as before, States that do not wish to be involved in this Eurovignette simply do not have to implement it.

That said, we still have a long way to go before road freight transport bears a reasonable proportion of the costs it represents for our societies: wear and tear of infrastructure, pollution, public health and accidents. As someone who lives in a city through which millions of heavy goods vehicles pass each year, I can confirm that the suffering of the populations concerned is rarely taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the issues that no one wants to address in this House: the very low wages paid to drivers, the terrible working conditions and the unacceptable driving times that compromise everyone’s safety. It is no exaggeration to talk about slaves of the road.</p>
<p class="contents">So yes, it is necessary to impose a maximum rate of taxation in order to encourage short journeys, piggyback transport, maritime transport and inland navigation, and it is necessary to make the entire Union and its neighbourhood strive for the best possible social conditions. However, it is important to have intelligent taxation, so that the ones paying are not transport SMEs, drivers and still less consumers, but large shippers and major customers such as the large-scale distribution sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, Eurovignette is not a European tax. This must be made very clear. In that sense, it is a bad name. On the contrary, it is a directive which limits and regulates national charges. We have 22 countries with different tolls and charges for different types of vehicles – heavy vehicles and private cars. All users from different countries pay these tolls if they appear on this network.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, please accept the compromise. This is much bigger and more complicated than it looks. There are two fundamental continuing fights behind this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a fight about principle – who should pay for the use of infrastructures and what specifically they should pay for. So it is going in the right direction. The ‘user pays’ and ‘polluter pays’ principle will inevitably continue. This is the direction that things are going.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fight is much more continuous and sharper. It is a conflict between the countries which have heavy transit traffic, which, of course, want more flexibility to address problems with their infrastructure, and clearly want to share the burden for the use of infrastructure between taxpayers and all users – I stress all users: there cannot be any discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is a group of countries who are fiercely against it. This was also very visible here during the debate. I must just remind you that on 15 October, the Council agreed on the political compromise. It was just short of a blocking minority and the fight continues here now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr El Khadraoui has done tremendous work to reach a good compromise and to have a good proposal for this compromise. I sincerely ask you to please support this compromise. It appears to have a lot of details that are not satisfactory in different parts and to different people but it is a really big step. This issue has been up in the air for years and years. Now we are taking a step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also shows, as the Commissioner has also mentioned, that a compromise has been reached. After great difficulties, problems and struggles of course, I am nevertheless convinced that this is a European success, as has already been mentioned by Mr Leichtfried. Thank you also for the appreciation expressed to the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As with every other compromise, a serious balancing act was carried out. We had to balance environmental and economic sustainability. I reject the notion that the Council did not attach any importance to environmental protection. Had it not been important, this directive would not exist. We also had to create a balance – and I would like to say this to Mr De Grandes Pascual as well – between the centre and the periphery. It is true that heated debates took place in the Council on the best ways to ensure that peripheral Member States do not feel locked out, and eventually a qualified majority was formed in the Council, and I hope – and I believe that the discussion has shown this as well – in Parliament, too.</p>
<p class="contents">We could say that this is just a drop in the ocean, but I believe – and I am happy that this has been acknowledged by many during the debate – that we have made an extremely important first step towards internalising costs and re-circulating revenues into the sector, even if, as with every compromise, it is not the most perfect one, and I am certain that we will be able to take further steps in the following years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention three specific issues which attracted several questions. The first one is the utilisation of revenues, and I would like to return to the comment made by Mr Sterckx. The agreement contains a detailed recommendation for Member States, precisely with respect to the utilisation of revenues, and states, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that 15% of generated revenues – and I emphasise this for Mrs Meissner in particular – should be used to finance trans-European transport projects. I would also like to add that this is the result of an adequate compromise and, as Mr Dirk Sterckx has also mentioned, a good and adequate one, although perhaps only a first step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The second specific question was also asked by Mr Sterckx, with respect to showing the costs of traffic jams and congestion. Well, the agreement reached with the European Parliament extends to this problem as well, since it makes it possible for Member States to determine road usage charges in a differentiated manner on the basis of location and time. As you all know, Member States have the opportunity to levy higher infrastructure charges during peak periods. This increased differentiation of infrastructure charges gives us an alternative for fighting traffic congestion, and even if we only include air and noise pollution in the calculation of external costs, the differentiation mechanism introduced in the directive can still make an efficient contribution to the reduction of traffic jams typical of European roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address your third question, specifically the question posed by Ms Lichtenberger concerning the external charges. The Council has already adopted its first-reading position on 14 February of this year, and we subsequently inserted a provision in the directive at the request of Parliament, to the effect that we will give a political signal to citizens concerning the environmental characteristics of heavy goods vehicles. To this end, we have included the possibility that in addition to the surcharge applied in mountainous regions, an external charge can be added in the case of Euro 0, 1, 2 and 3 vehicles. Since Euro 3 vehicles are less polluting than the other most polluting vehicles in the Euro emission categories, the double charge system will apply to them only from a later date, while it will already be applicable to the other categories from the effective date of the directive. Furthermore, the agreement reached with the European Parliament also provides incentives in respect of the least polluting vehicles in the Euro 5 and 6 categories, in order to promote the renewal of the vehicle fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become very clear from our debate today that we have made an extremely important step forward for the transport sector with the Eurovignette Directive. The specific recommendation regarding heavy goods vehicles is important not only in itself, but it also carries a symbolic significance. It is the first to apply – and I am glad that you have confirmed this in your comments – the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and launches a lengthy debate and implementation process, which leads to the internalisation of the external costs of all transportation methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Hungarian Presidency is very pleased that this agreement was reached with the European Parliament, and I am sure that the measure debated now and awaiting adoption by Parliament can lead to an increase in economic efficiency and a decrease in the negative environmental impacts in the transport sector, and that as a result, European Union citizens will be the winners of this directive being adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The transport sector is important for our economy. It does, however, also give rise to costs – infrastructure costs, but also other costs such as fine particulates in the air, noise, traffic jams and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">With this revised directive, we will finally be creating a European framework that gives the Member States the opportunity to get the costs partly paid back by those who actually gave rise to them. At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs. In this way, we can make our society more liveable, increase the efficiency of the sector and also contribute to a more level playing field between the different modes of transport, so as, in so doing, to also provide greater opportunities for the railways and inland waterways.</p>
<p class="contents">I stressed earlier on, in my introduction, how difficult it was to reach this compromise. The aim in the Commission’s White Paper, by the way, is to achieve the mandatory internalisation of external costs by 2020. That promises heated discussions over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meanwhile, I hope, first of all, that this plenary grants sufficient support to enable us to get going and to demonstrate that Europe can also take decisions that are good for our citizens. Secondly, I hope that a number of Member States will now really get on with making use of the new opportunities and will also be able to tempt other Member States to join in on the strength of their good results. That will enable us to build a wider support base to also go further. In the meantime, this directive provides the Commission with an awful lot of homework to be getting on with. Over the forthcoming years, the ideas of also internalising other external costs, making internalisation mandatory and including other types of vehicles, also need to be looked into. These are things for the forthcoming years, however. We must first take this step forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basic and most important issue is the provision which establishes the ‘polluter pays’ principle, according to which heavy goods vehicles which cause more pollution and are noisier than those fitted with engines which comply with the Euro V or Euro VI standards will be subject to tolls for using road infrastructure. In addition, allowance has been made for the possibility of a certain dependence of tolls on vehicle movement (road congestion) at peak hours – for a maximum, however, of five hours a day. I think that this solution will successfully encourage avoidance of the use of some sections of road during peak hours. Furthermore, the Member States will be able to specify the use to be made of revenue generated from tolls collected, but at least 15% will have to be used for financial support for TEN-T projects, in order to increase transport sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report introduces the key phrase ‘the polluter pays’, which means that the change to the rules on road transport tolls will allow us to add the real costs of air and noise pollution by lorries to the taxes and fees collected when heavy goods vehicles use motorways. In addition, the directive stipulates that money collected in this way should be used to finance effective and environmentally friendly transport systems. At the same time, 15% of the fees collected must be invested in pan-European transport networks: not just road transport, but also rail and inland waterway transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive will apply to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, I think that this provision goes too far, because such vehicles mainly operate regionally, and this should not be regulated at European level. At the same time, a Member State has the right to exempt vehicles under 12 tonnes, an option which I hope Estonia will use.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of Estonia, I think that this directive will bring to an end the situation in which our lorries pay in other countries, while vehicles from other countries do not pay to drive on our roads. I hope that the government will put an end to this type of unequal treatment and set equal conditions for all. The directive also provides an incentive for fleet renewal: the newer and lower-polluting the vehicle, the less tax it must pay. This requires large investments from transport companies, which will actually pay off relatively quickly, both in terms of lower road tax and in terms of lower fuel consumption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In regions such as mine, where international freight vehicles clog the Alpine roads, this is a long-awaited measure.</p>
<p class="contents">This revision is also a first step towards the reintroduction of fair competition between European road hauliers, since some Member States, such as France and Germany, already apply the ‘polluter pays’ principle and want the EU to extend it to all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters now is that the revenue from the Eurovignette actually goes towards projects to improve infrastructure, cut pollution and protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the Member States’ undertaking to reassign part of this revenue to the TEN-T, a major project designed to guarantee Europe’s territorial cohesion and to improve access in regions such as those of the Alps, where the infrastructure is not sufficient to ensure a modal shift from road transport to other forms of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must remember that transport firms, particularly during a crisis, will not be able to afford to change their fleets quickly and buy vehicles which comply with the Euro V and VI standards. We cannot, therefore, punish hauliers for external factors over which they have no influence. In my opinion, we need to try to achieve a maximum extension of the period during which incentives apply to the ecologically cleanest vehicles. Transport firms which invest in low-emission technologies must have the right to an appropriate period during which their investments are guaranteed, when they would pay the lowest charges or be exempt.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we very often emphasise in Parliament that people are the most important. Let us remember, therefore, that the transport sector around the Union not only represents excessive noise or CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions but also represents, above all, hundreds of thousands of jobs and an important component of GDP in many Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It underwent this review on 15 March 2011 in Brussels, with the participation of specialists from Austria, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. The ethical audit concerning the work of this project produced a positive result and this has been certified. No problems have been found with the ethical aspects of the project. The ethical aspects of the report have been continuously monitored by the European Commission from the very outset. I want to stress this and to ask the House to take care that our report does not contain information which does not have a basis in fact.

<p class="contents">For her to say that an MEP’s immunity should be waived because the comments for which he or she is being criticised did not come within the scope of his or her parliamentary activities is absolute nonsense from a legal point of view. If that had been the case, legal action would not have been possible! This is the basis of the current Article 8. By definition, Article 9 applies to activities beyond the scope of this Parliament! Parliament now preserves or waives immunity according to how it feels: it waives it for political opinions in one case, but preserves it for suspected tax evasion in another, considering it an example of <span class="italic">fumus persecutionis</span>. As I am more strongly attached to freedom of expression than the pseudo democrats in this House, I shall systematically refuse to waive the immunity of one of my fellow Members, from whichever political group, for the expression of his or her opinions, no matter how much they differ from my own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ágnes Hankiss is accused by a private plaintiff of an alleged offence of defamation of honour committed in public (Section 179 of the Hungarian Criminal Code) and, in particular the defamation of the memory of a dead person, the plaintiff’s father, under Section 181 of the Hungarian Criminal Code, as a result of a statement made during the programme ‘<span class="italic">Péntek 8 mondatvadász</span>’ on 23 January 2004. On 12 November 2009, the Supreme Court considered that there was indeed a violation of the substantive provisions of criminal law and ordered a renewed procedure to be conducted by the Central District Court of Buda. The court is to conduct this renewed procedure in light of considerations stated in the decision of the Supreme Court. The Central District Court of Buda opened renewed proceedings on 31 March 2010. On the same day, the proceedings were suspended on the grounds that Ágnes Hankiss enjoys parliamentary immunity as a Member of the European Parliament.

Therefore, the only effective method of preventing distortions in the market and continuing to control textile imports is still to subject such imports to verification procedures that require indication of the country of origin. That indication is, in fact, contained in the proposal for a regulation on ‘Made in’ origin marking, which was adopted in this Chamber on 21 October 2010, which introduces a control mechanism and aims to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better, clearer legislative framework for companies and for consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since these products can be freely imported, proving their origin is apparently unnecessary, but there are still some doubts about this facilitating measure. I cannot fail to stress the need to ensure the quality of products sold within Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them. Beyond simply knowing the origin of textile products from outside the Union, it is essential to ensure that European standards are met, and to not allow raw materials and processed products to enter and be sold in the Union without meeting the minimum conditions. I also believe that more important than ascertaining the type of products used in the manufacture of textile products is to assess whether these are in compliance with competition rules and respect for workers’ dignity and rights, as cases where these are violated are on the increase. This has unacceptable consequences for the workers themselves and for the viability of the European textile sector, particularly in Portugal, which has been forced to compete with producers that systematically fail to observe such rules and rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to continue controlling imports of textile products still subject to remaining quantitative restrictions and originating from countries that are not yet members of the World Trade Organisation, the EU will now rely on import authorisations. Meanwhile, concerning the categories of products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature that are not subject to quantitative import restrictions and are released for free circulation in the EU, a system of ex post statistical surveillance is being applied to monitor their impact on the EU market. We would point out that, in addition to the abovementioned import control mechanisms, it has been mandatory since 2010 to indicate the country of origin of certain third-country products in order to better inform consumers about their origin. We should now seek to enhance the uniformity of the rules for import by aligning the rules relating to textile imports with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, the report expressly states that implementation of the Muscardini report on ‘Made in’ origin marking – which, by the way, we strongly supported – will serve to protect origin marking.

<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of a regulation that enhances the uniformity of the rules for European textile imports by aligning them with those for other industrial goods. However, we should bear in mind the fact that, even if we use ex ante and ex post control mechanisms to assess the impact of third-country imports on the European market, the European Union has not yet been able to adopt a control mechanism based on fair and important information for consumers such as that provided by origin marking. I hope that the Council, too, will quickly come to a positive conclusion on the decisive steps taken by this House towards ensuring traceability and adequate information on products.

The very limited trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports.

In fact, in order to continue controlling imports of textile products still subject to remaining quantitative restrictions and originating from Belarus and North Korea, which are not yet members of the World Trade Organisation, the EU now relies on import authorisations.

In the ambit of the better law making approach, the Commission proposes to repeal a 1998 Council Regulation under which importers have to provide proof of origin of textiles and articles of apparel for EU customs procedures. The regulation had value as long as quantitative restrictions on textiles and articles of apparel existed through the WTO’s Multifibre Agreement. This agreement was terminated in 2005. By 2008, the Agreement on textiles and clothing between the EU and China and all other surveillance systems for imports of textiles and clothing from China had also ended. Textile and clothing imports from Belarus and North Korea, neither of which are members of the WTO, are still subject to quantitative restrictions. The system of import authorisations still remains in place for controls on these imports, which, however, do not pose problems with regard to the functioning of the EU market.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is deemed sufficient. All in all, Parliament is advocating a new ‘made in’ labelling regime, which is currently a Sleeping Beauty after the conclusion of the first reading in 2010.

It should be noted that in 2005, quantitative restrictions on textile and clothing imports originating in World Trade Organisation (WTO) member countries were rules, while the rules for the same type of products originating in the People’s Republic of China expired at the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I am voting in favour of this report, as I believe that it marks a positive step in defining a clearer and simpler legislative environment for European businesses which import textile and footwear products originating in third countries for which there continue to be quantitative restrictions because they are not WTO members.

The nature of the work by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is very important in this area, as it allows the various Member States to create an international knowledge and information base. Information is crucial for analysing and creating strategies to reduce and combat the existence of drug markets and drug addiction. Croatia has been expressing its wish to work with the EU on this crucial issue since 2005, and it is now time for this to happen, through its inclusion in the work of the EMCDDA, which is based in Lisbon. The proposal set out in the report regarding Croatia’s compliance with its obligations to the EMCDDA and the EU is very positive. I am voting in favour of this report as I believe that this link between Croatia and the EU will contribute not only to a more effective fight against the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction, but also to the creation of greater solidarity between the EU and Croatia, which is an accession candidate, and will – at least, I hope so – shortly become a fully fledged Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia, just like other countries, is having to contend with drug addiction, and it has very tough legislation in this area. Preventative work is being done chiefly in schools, because that social group is the most vulnerable to drug dependence. Croatia, as a candidate country for EU membership, has a duty to adapt its legal system to the system which is in force in the countries of the Union. I think that Croatia’s participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is extremely important, particularly because Croatia is a transit route. Illicit substances are smuggled through Croatia from the production countries to consumer countries.

Consequently, it is very important to obtain accurate data and information on drugs and drug addiction, because these are global phenomena, posing a threat to the health, security and social well-being of us all. I support Croatia’s participation in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Croatia aims to become a full member of the European Union. It should be noted that Croatia is a transit route through which large quantities of drugs are smuggled to other countries. I am pleased that Croatia is making significant efforts to combat the trafficking, use of and trade in illegal drugs. However, Croatia remains one of the main routes for trafficking drugs to the EU. It is therefore crucial to quickly obtain factual and objective information on drugs, drug addiction and the consequences of these. Furthermore, this will create an ideal framework for Croatia to obtain information on other EU Member States’ best practices in addressing problems related to drugs and drug addiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 14 June 2010, the Commission published its Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which included 24 specific recommendations for action. The action plan was prepared by taking into account the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and use of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service). The EU launched the EGNOS project (and Galileo) to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market. Europe’s current market share of 25% is below expectations. EGNOS will offer more possibilities (EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS) when Galileo becomes operational in 2013. The Commission is best placed to coordinate the implementation of the action plan to avoid duplication at Member State level and to ensure overall progress in various EU policy fields covered by GNSS applications. In view of the major economic benefits, which EGNOS will have on the broader European economy if fully developed and deployed, the Commission should set out clear priorities in this area, including the operation of EGNOS throughout the whole of the EU and ensuring adequate investment in related research and technological development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These systems are used everywhere, today, in every form of transport. The continued expansion of this sector means that the value of European systems is projected to reach a level of EUR 230 billion by 2025. The EU’s EGNOS and Galileo projects can contribute to competitiveness in every area of this sector of services, because they are markedly better and more accurate than the GPS system while also being compatible with it. Unfortunately, the countries in the east and south of the Union are still not covered by the EGNOS system. Extending its range would, therefore, appear to be essential in the context of its further development. Something else which has not been made clear is how the costs of maintaining the Galileo system will be financed. They are estimated at around EUR 800 million per year.

They represent added value not only for industry but also for transport in Europe, which is why I fully support them.

The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system must cover the entire European Union, and should be extended to northern, eastern and south-eastern Europe. In order for it to be fully effective for transport purposes, it must include not only the entire Union, but also our closest neighbours.

The EU could not afford to fall behind in this satellite navigation technology, so it developed its European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the forerunner of the Galileo system, which it is hoped should be operational in 2013 and will be ten times more accurate than GPS.

Among other aspects, they can make them safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical. GNSS can also play a vital role in supporting and promoting the use of so-called intelligent transport systems. The rapporteur addresses some of these aspects. However, like other technologies, the practical results of GNSS applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur, and from the ends and objectives they serve. This is the case in general, and in this sector in particular. As such, it is not surprising that it is proposed that this system should also help establish the Single European Sky, for instance; we would like to distance ourselves from this aspect of the report.

However, like other technologies, the practical results of the applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur, and from the ends and objectives they serve.

Indeed, the estimated global market value in 2008 was EUR 124 billion, projected to reach EUR 230 billion by 2025. Of this, 20% is represented by intelligent transport systems (ITS) and 5% by safety applications, including transport safety applications. This project aims to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in this growing strategic market. Europe’s current market share of 25% is below expectations. EGNOS is GPS-compatible but will offer more possibilities when Galileo becomes operational in 2013. EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS at present. These aspects have immediate and important implications for the transport sector, including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, and I am therefore voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the EGNOS system is to be developed further, priority must be given to the measures proposed in the action plan and adequate investment and funding in research and development activities must be provided without fail. Indeed, a lack of European funding for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in this research project under the seventh and eighth framework programmes would make it less attractive to commercial operators.

However, Europe is failing to compete globally in this field and our current market share of 25% is below what is expected. We must ensure we take the necessary steps to ensure this industry achieves its full potential. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is ten times more accurate than GPS and it is predicted that accuracy to 45 centimetres can be achieved in the near future. This system has obvious uses in the fields of air and sea transport and can also be used in road transport. However, we must be mindful of encroaching too much on European citizens as there are obvious personal privacy issues with such technology. Overall, I welcome ENGOS and GNSS as they can make an important contribution to safety and environmental objectives and I believe adequate investment in the related research and development will be essential.

This industry represents a growing global market in which Europe should take the lead and achieve its independence. GNSS applications and services in the area of transport have various implications for security, for effectiveness, and for the economic and environmental costs of all modes of transport. I also believe that it is important to note that in order for there to be fair development, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programme should cover all of the Member States and enable interoperability and compatibility with third countries, so as to make this market competitive and dynamic. Finally, I would stress the rapporteur’s idea that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should ensure adequate levels of funding for GNSS research and development, as well as for its implementation.

Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means of both market access and regulatory convergence to promote fair competition, including issues with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards. I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament needs to follow the process from the very beginning and be closely involved in the topics under discussion to discover the current state of the negotiations on air agreements.

<p class="contents">Indeed, regulatory convergence can do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, social and environmental standards. It is unfortunate that the Council has yet to grant the Commission a mandate to open negotiations on a global air transport agreement with important trading partners, such as the People’s Republic of China and India, despite the proposal dating from 2005. The economic growth of this region enhances the value of such agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In terms of horizontal agreements, it is also important to align existing bilateral agreements with EU law, so as to ensure greater legal certainty, increase transparency and provide additional benefits in terms of simplification, while ensuring that all Union airlines will enjoy the same rights.

We have reiterated our position against this principle in successive agreements upon which Parliament has delivered opinions, along with criticism of the comprehensive nature of these agreements, which are, without exception, aimed at the liberalisation and privatisation of the sector. The rapporteur – who, significantly, is from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – states that ‘air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reality in this and in other sectors which have seen increased liberalisation, such as rail transport, belies these promises of benefits. If there really is a winner from processes of monopolistic concentration in the air transport sector – which is what inevitably follows liberalisation and ‘free competition’ – it is not the passengers, nor the workers, nor many of the so-called ‘flag carrier’ airlines, but rather the major European companies in the sector. Those are the reasons why we voted against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a significant step forward, especially in light of the EU’s supposed democratic deficit, if we consider that, previously, Parliament, a body democratically elected by the people of Europe, was consulted on such agreements only after they had been concluded. We therefore expect the Commission to respond to our call for it to maintain the flow of information and to provide the responsible committee with comprehensive information about the intention to propose negotiations with a view to concluding and amending international air agreements, so that Parliament as a whole can express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for every agreement to relax or eliminate restrictions on market access and investment opportunities, to maintain and enhance social and environmental standards, to provide adequate safeguards for data protection and privacy, to include mutual recognition of security standards and ensure a high level of passenger rights.

This report appears in this context. As Parliament has also come to have powers in relation to air agreements, it is important to ensure that it has access to information throughout the negotiation process. Indeed, it cannot simply be involved at the end of the process, whereby its activity is reduced to merely agreeing or disagreeing with the final solution, without having a range of relevant indicators at its disposal in order to make a considered decision. Underpinned by the need to involve Parliament throughout the process, it is also necessary to draw attention, even if only in general terms, to aspects such as the terms under which information is provided or the stages at which it should be made available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism decided to draw up an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles on how air agreements should be evaluated, covering both their substance and the procedures the Committee might adopt to ensure it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations, and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taken together, aviation markets in the European Union and the United States account for around 60% of the world’s air traffic. The future opening of the market to EU and US aviation enterprises on a non-discriminatory basis will offer better services to passengers and air transport carriers, will bring significant economic benefits and will create jobs. Unfortunately, the European Parliament was not involved in the negotiations on the EU-US agreement and so was not able to influence the content of the document. This is an unacceptable situation. I agree, therefore, with the main thesis of the Simpson report on international air agreements, which has been adopted today. The European Parliament should have been involved in the negotiations from the very beginning, or should at least have been kept informed as to their progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the goals of reducing pollution and implementing the ‘polluter pays’ principle in the area of road transport. I also supported the proposal for revenue obtained from the Eurovignette charge to be earmarked for investment in road infrastructure and to be used to make transport greener. The promotion of sustainable transport is a key element of the common transport policy.

By endorsing the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council, we are putting an end to long years of negotiation. This is certainly a step in the right direction but it is a minimalistic agreement that lacks teeth! Indeed, Member States will only have the possibility, but in no way will they be obliged, of making heavy goods vehicles pay for the external costs they cause. The fact remains that the idea is now out there and that is the real positive point which enables me to vote for the compromise. By introducing the ‘polluter pays’ principle for heavy goods vehicles, the directive paves the way for the recognition in our public policies of the internalisation of external costs caused by transport. The principle of transparency of revenue and investment is also on the record which, we hope, will be a precedent in assessing public policies: indeed, Member States will have to report to the Commission on a regular basis. However, the low allocation threshold of revenue to the trans-European transport networks (TENs) (15%) is regrettable. In addition, we will have to ensure that the commitment made by the Member States to invest revenue in sustainable projects has been kept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the submission of this proposal for a new directive, the fruit of the compromise reached between the Hungarian Presidency, the Commission and Parliament, is very damaging to the Italian economy, since Italy transports around a third – or approximately EUR 200 billion a year – of all the traded goods hauled on Europe’s roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the directive has been implemented in Europe’s countries of transit, goods imported to and exported from Italy will be more exposed to the burden of additional charges. I share the Italian Government’s highly critical view: it believes that, at a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now, the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is far from wise. To my mind, the small breakthroughs that were achieved with the compromise have no real impact on a text that is highly detrimental to both the Italian system and the haulage industry. What is more, the effectiveness of the measure has not been proven: road transport and its associated pollution costs will continue to increase until an intermodal infrastructure network has been developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ‘polluter pays’ principle has been introduced for the first time in this sector in order to encourage safer and more sustainable transport, and hence to promote alternatives such as rail transport. Under the compromise reached, however, due consideration must also be given to the protection of the haulage industry, which must not be penalised excessively. Member States must therefore strive to make more effective use of the revenues collected under the Eurovignette, for example, by investing in infrastructure improvements and encouraging the use of less polluting haulage vehicles, so as to ensure that the benefits of the directive are enjoyed by all the sectors involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an innovative initiative which I welcome, as it allows environmental and social costs to be taken into account and is not limited merely to infrastructure costs. It is, nevertheless, regrettable that the European Parliament’s ambitious plans for stringent environmental requirements have been hindered by the Council of Ministers, under the pretext of overly high additional costs.

However, I still believe that these instruments are only economically beneficial and favourable for a few central transit European Union Member States, and therefore completely unfavourable or much less favourable for a large number of European Union Member States, situated near the European Union’s borders, both in the east, the south, the west and the north.

I hope that the lower charges for vehicles which are less polluting will motivate owners of transport firms who have not done so to renew their fleets. Furthermore, crops which grow in the vicinity of heavily used roads would be much less exposed to pollution from exhaust fumes. I think the increased charges for driving at peak hours are another positive feature. Thanks to these restrictions, we will achieve greater safety on the roads and better driving conditions for all road users. These restrictions will also allow improvements to the state of the infrastructure, which suffers the greatest damage at those very hours of peak traffic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increasing the costs borne by this sector means increasing the burden on society as a whole and penalising our goods, for which there will be a corresponding fall in demand. I do not believe that this compromise is the right answer, particularly for a country such as Italy, for example, which is a departure point for transport flows that create wealth for our national system and that need to be safeguarded through the identification of appropriate tools that will combat air and noise pollution, but which have due regard for its specific structural and logistical characteristics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This 1999 directive, revised in 2006, aims to harmonise the charging of heavy good vehicles. The adopted revision is a first step in internalising external costs in road transport and, hence, a step towards putting the ‘polluter pays’ principle into practice. Air and noise pollution from traffic will thus be charged electronically, at a rate of three to four cents per kilometre depending on the vehicle’s Euro class, the type of road and the level of congestion. This revision will henceforth allow traffic to be managed better through increased charges in peak periods (not exceeding 175% over five hours), but also provides for a proportionate decrease in low peak charges to avoid penalising road haulage companies financially. Finally, the resolution encourages Member States to use the amounts raised to finance certain types of sustainable transport projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that, at a time of great economic difficulty, the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market purely in order to make money is not very wise. Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of ‘central’ and transit countries, is unacceptable. Lastly, when establishing the principle, no thought has been given to the impact of this measure on traffic flows and, hence, on existing concessions, meaning that there is a risk of the traffic going elsewhere.

At the same time, this should also give rise to an instrument to better manage traffic demand. This report takes a pragmatic approach in order to reconcile the numerous and varying wishes. In this context, however, we must not overlook the various initiatives to pave the way for so-called giga- or megaliners, which are associated with high infrastructure costs. It is also the case that, hitherto, lip service alone has been paid to moving freight traffic from road to rail. We should also not forget these factors, including when it comes to the idea in the proposal of earmarking the revenue from infrastructure charges. As far as the incentives for fleet renewal are concerned, we must also consider that we must not unilaterally burden our local carriers and fleet-owners with strict environmental and safety regulations, only for the low-cost competitors to come riding over the border in foul scrap vehicles.

Yes, it is right to combat pollution and try to ease traffic congestion, but introducing another tax increase is definitely not the best solution in my view. By applying this ‘Eurovignette’, the chances are that only the largest haulage companies – that is, those with more resources at their disposal – will manage to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">Many small businesses, especially in Italy, risk having to leave the market because of the excessive charges they would face, and this would certainly have a serious impact on employment too. My hope, therefore, is that other European countries will adopt the same position as the Italian Government, which has already confirmed that it will not be applying this measure. The crisis has caused great damage to the haulage industry, and this new tax will certainly not contribute much to its recovery as far as I can see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that it would be inappropriate to create yet another additional tax burden for hauliers, who have been badly affected by the financial crisis. The charge will reflect not just road infrastructure costs, the vehicle’s pollution category and length of journey, but also the level of pollution, noise and congestion. Moreover, the charge will not only be applied to motorways in the trans-European road network, but also to other motorways and important roads. Attention should be drawn to the fact that such regulation will have a negative impact on European road hauliers’ revenue and increase delivery times. Due to the reasons mentioned, there will be an increase in transportation costs and the price of freight transportation. Furthermore, a toll may significantly reduce the demand for road transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this, I voted in favour of this report, as it will allow the Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some limited external costs, with the aim of introducing the ‘polluter pays’ principle to road transport. It will also give Member States more opportunities to make their respective national road pricing systems more efficient, which means a better instrument for transport demand management. These objectives were confirmed by the Council’s position. It is worth highlighting the proposal to earmark the revenue from charges on external cost and infrastructure to be used for sustainable transport and trans-European networks, in particular. Effective earmarking of this revenue, which increases accountability and transparency, will not only increase public acceptance but will also ensure the reduction of external costs on road transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These costs will still admit of some exceptions, provided that the Member State requesting them has a good reason for doing so. There will be incentives to promote the renewal of the fleet of heavy goods vehicles, derogations for heavy goods vehicles fitted with less polluting engines and, finally, the toll charge may vary according to the time of travel. This is to ensure that heavy goods vehicles can avoid certain road sections during peak hours. The revenues generated from this toll charge increase will have to be reinvested in transport infrastructure, with at least 15% to be earmarked initially for trans-European transport projects.

Lithuania is a valuable transit country for Europe. Freight transportation and hard working lorry drivers have become synonymous with our country. According to data from the Lithuanian Road Administration, the number of heavy goods vehicles on principle routes has tripled in the last decade and they are helping to form the backbone of our economy. Lithuania has already been racked by the financial crisis and a rise in transport costs would be a heavy blow. I agree with the rapporteur that the Member States should be given opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I am familiar with the issues of pollution mentioned in this report and I take them very seriously, but additional charges for air and noise pollution are not the answer. The problem is much greater than the report suggests. In many EU Member States, road infrastructure is in need of further development. At the same time, in Lithuania, the funding earmarked for road management and development has dropped by more than 20% in the last few years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise, is more advisable than the previous version, which was restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure. The directive is favourable to transit countries, so MEPs from Poland should be particularly keen on its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth stressing the fact that the charges are to be lower the higher the ecological category of the heavy goods vehicle. Fortunately, vehicles with a maximum permissible laden weight of 3.5-12 tonnes and car drivers will be exempt from the charges. The structure of tolls will depend on the time of day, which, in my opinion, will help to discourage people from using sections of road which are at risk of congestion during peak periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important provision of the directive is the one which concerns the way in which income from tolls is spent. This money is to be reinvested in transport infrastructure of any kind, while a minimum of 15% of the revenues are to be earmarked for TEN-T projects. I think we also need long-term measures which will bring about convergence in the methods which all charging systems of the Member States use to calculate external costs. This could guarantee transparency in the signals given to the European road haulage sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it relates to chemical and physical factors which, at first glance, are of little use in communication between politicians and voters, this indicator is, in fact, the result of numerous economic decisions: it indicates the concentration of polluting economic activities, the composition of the energy mix used for productive activities and for heating homes and offices, the use of motor vehicles and the management of road infrastructure and traffic, the insulation of buildings and the quality of the materials used, and the existence or otherwise of green spaces, to cite just a few examples. Air quality also has a significant impact on health expenditure, and particularly on expenditure on respiratory and oncology units. It is very clear, then, that an environmental indicator can be turned into an economic and political indicator. Furthermore, it can point to new mechanisms for discouraging irresponsible behaviour and for financing worthy projects. These links help politicians to take better decisions in the public interest.

While I think that priority should be given firstly to data already available (that is, collected at regional, national and European level), I believe that if the need arises for additional modules, which does not entail unnecessary bureaucracy or additional costs, in this case, Eurostat should be allowed to gather data from Member States with a view to setting up environmental economic accounts at European level.</p>

This idea is important, and is indeed the only way of obtaining concrete data about the real impact of environmental policy. If, on the one hand, economic growth cannot neglect the environment, it is also true that environmental policy cannot neglect or lose sight of economic activity and the competitiveness of European business and industry. I always see the problem of sustainable development through this prism, whereby economic growth and respect for the environment are necessarily two sides of the same coin. Europe cannot and must not forget this, especially at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By the end of 2013, the Commission should table a report addressing issues such as the situation of our forests and how depleted our fisheries resources are. To this end, we need a credible and up-to-date statistical basis, to be created under this regulation. The legal framework created with this proposal will allow the EU to assess environmental economic accounts, taking sustainable development into consideration. It has never been so vital to pay attention to the dichotomy between the environment and the economy. I voted in favour of this report because, besides making it possible to reach policy decisions that are more comprehensive and reasoned, it echoes the proverb ‘we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children’.

In this respect, the adoption of a European legal basis for the collection of data on environmental economic accounts will mean that estimates can be provided at European level regarding the existing interaction between economic and environmental factors.

A system for preparing environmental economic accounts is one of the measures that would aid the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions, environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic material flow accounting. However, the binding nature of this system creates an additional administrative burden. Therefore, when introducing such a system, it is necessary to properly assess the impact of its application, set out the desired objectives more specifically and establish clearly the future direction to be taken with regard to environmental economic accounts. Attention should be drawn to the fact that Eurostat will be granted the main supervisory and liability functions in these areas. The implementation of the functions mentioned requires sufficient human and financial resources.

On the basis of our amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the compromise negotiated with the Council contains, in addition to the accounts initially proposed, a requirement for the Commission to report by the end of 2013 and examine extension of the accounts to cover material stocks (and not only flows) as well as eco-system services.

<p class="contents">There was an immediate response to assist the countries in North Africa – more than EUR 1 million for humanitarian assistance – and this assistance will continue. Through the Hermes joint operation, the Frontex border agency is coordinating a response to the strong migratory pressure. However, it is very important that Member States in the Mediterranean region, together with third countries, continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts. More needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">So my very direct answer to you is that, yes, we need more resources for Frontex. The proposals to reinforce Frontex need to be adopted as a matter of urgency. We also need Member States to show political will and, above all, solidarity among themselves by offering the requisite technical and human resources. As you know, the European Union as such does not have all those resources, so we need the cooperation of the Member States in making them available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think there is a political will to do this but it needs to be done in a coordinated manner and this is where an effort has been initiated by the Commission: Commissioner Malmström is working on the matter with the Member States, and I hope the European Council later this month will confirm our thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, of course, we also need the cooperation of third countries.

He said it is necessary for this mechanism to be able to provide countries with flexible credit lines. He said that this mechanism has to be able to go to the secondary market and, most importantly, he said that this can be done by discounted swaps with its own AAA rated bonds. This is very important because it means that you can swap bad bonds from countries in difficulties with the rescue mechanism’s AAA bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, he also said that the Commission should start to examine the possibility of Eurobonds – finally, I may say.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to you, Mr Barroso, is can you confirm that this is also the position of the Commission? Secondly, as time is pressing, will you propose these changes to the rescue mechanism at the next European Council meeting in two weeks’ time? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding Eurobonds, this is not a new idea. The Commission has, for many years, including one of my predecessors, put forward the idea of Eurobonds. The reality is that so far, Member States have not accepted the idea; namely, when we had the crisis with Greece, the Commission proposed some idea of mutualisation of the debt, which was rejected by most of the Member States in the euro area. I think that there is now some progress in terms of accepting the idea of considering several options, and the Commission will, of course, present several options. We have always thought that the idea of Eurobonds was an attractive one provided the Member States could support it, but we are not yet there, to be honest. We are not yet there and I think what we have to do now is focus on the ESM. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You really do still seem to prefer pouring in more and more money and providing more and more endless loans to economies that are in serious trouble and on the very brink of collapse, or are we starting to see common sense here, and to consider seriously the possibility of restructuring their government debts, because, in my opinion, we cannot avoid this in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some Member States outside the euro area are also involved in balance of payment support programmes through the Commission and the IMF.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the euro area, as you say, there are discussions ongoing between the Member States, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank on achieving the best possible comprehensive response. As you know, there is not always expert agreement on the best way to obtain that response. This is still ongoing work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to recognise that these issues are extremely difficult and complex. The magnitude of the challenge is unprecedented and it requires some work of convergence. That is why the Commission has been extremely prudent in the way it communicates on that matter because some of these issues are market sensitive. One thing is clear: as we have said, restructuring is not an alternative to the painful fiscal consolidation efforts that all the Member States have to make if they want to correct their imbalances in terms of deficit and debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say three things.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there should be no more restructuring. We all know that at some point, there will be a restructuring of the debt, for instance in Greece, for the simple reason that the Greek Government needs to be given the chance to regain confidence and that Greek society needs to be restructured. As things stand in Greece, nobody trusts anyone, least of all the government. Until the government manages to give its people another outlook for the future, other than one of austerity, it will not manage to revive its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing that needs to be discussed by the Commission and the parties concerned should therefore be the need to inject some confidence in the Greek people, without which no measures can be adopted at all. Yet the prevailing austerity does not give Greek society time to stop and think. That is why they are rejecting it, which could be extremely risky.</p>
<p class="contents">One final question: tax evasion. Could not Europe also lend Greece a hand on this matter? Greek accounts are held in banks in Austria, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Switzerland. Why not freeze those accounts, or at the very least, challenge banking secrecy so that the Greek Government can ascertain where the problem of tax evasion lies. We ask them to put a stop to tax evasion and yet, at the same time, we are not offering them any help. It is our banks, the European banks, which are actually covering up this tax evasion, </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are currently addressing the issue of banking secrecy. As you know, since March 2009, all Member States as well as Switzerland have agreed to implement the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standard which stipulates that a State cannot refuse to provide information if so requested by another State, on the grounds that this information is held by a bank or any other financial institution. This principle was included by us, the Commission, in the directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, which came into force on 11 March 2011 and which, unfortunately, will only be applied on 1 January 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of banking secrecy has therefore been dealt with at European level from a legal point of view and cannot constitute an obstacle to the full exchange of information on request between tax authorities. I believe that all the criteria have already been met, on the basis of administrative cooperation, for Member States and the EU to now give Greece information about any fraud or tax evasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding Cathy Ashton, she is not only Vice-President of the Commission, but also High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

I waited until the end as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I have a question to ask you that relates to the grave situation in which we, in the European Union, find ourselves. 2008 was the year of a deep crisis in banking. In 2009, this banking crisis led to a deep economic crisis in the real economy. The assumption of the costs of banking deficits by the public purses ultimately led, in 2010, to a deep crisis in national budgets. This deep crisis of the national budgets is being accompanied by an orgy of cuts, which is leading to dramatic situations in several Member States of the European Union, in part as a result of measures demanded by the European Union. There is a risk that, following the banking crisis, the economic crisis and the crisis in the national budgets, 2011 and 2012 will be the years of social crisis in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, Mr Barroso, is the Commission prepared to discuss with us how we can improve the underfunding of the social welfare net – social security systems – in the Member States of the European Union, in particular, in those Member States hardest hit by the budgetary crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, are you prepared to have a definitive discussion with us about Eurobonds in order to obtain the resources that we need to be able to invest in the economy to facilitate growth and jobs in the hardest hit Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, we believe that each euro being spent now on debt interest means one euro less for the hospitals, public health services, public education and social security.

However, the G8 statement said that it would support countries in the region that move towards not just democracy, but also a market economy. It wants these countries to ‘reap the benefits of globalisation’ and to engage in ‘investment integration’, which means making it easier for G8 countries to make money in these countries and then take the money out again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not object to recipients of aid being expected to implement and retain democratic institutions and procedures. That would be quite right. However, is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard?

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, the six-year transition period of the Sudanese Comprehensive Peace Agreement will come to an end in about a month’s time. This is a historic moment for Sudan, and indeed for the whole African continent. The people of Southern Sudan have waited a long time for this moment, when their country’s independence will be declared on 9 July. The European Union will be represented at the Independence Day ceremony by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a credible referendum at the beginning of this year, we commended Sudanese parties on the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum. We welcomed that President Bashir had publicly said that North Sudan would be the first to recognise an independent South Sudan. But the positive momentum of the immediate post-referendum period has vanished. There are worrying tendencies towards increased tensions and conflict. The recent violent clashes in and around Abyei could well lead to another military confrontation between North and South Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed Sudan in the Foreign Affairs Council, both in January and in May, and will revert to it at the 20 June Foreign Affairs Council. At the Council, the High Representative intends to present a comprehensive EU strategic approach for Sudan, mainly focusing on an independent South Sudan, but also including elements for constructive engagement with North Sudan, including the Transitional Areas, Darfur and the East. In fact, we will be witnessing the birth of not one new state but two.</p>
<p class="contents">The comprehensive approach will be a political strategy document, setting out all the key strands of our policy towards Sudan. The EU’s main objectives are to support peace between the two states and democratisation and prosperity within both of them. We want to see two viable states coexisting as good neighbours sharing an open border, allowing for cross-border exchanges of people, goods, capital and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">South Sudan will need all our attention in terms of stabilisation, state-, institution- and capacity-building and long-term development. Our utmost concern would be to avoid state failure.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of a possible response strategy, we will be looking at a number of important elements: stepping up the EU presence in Juba by establishing an EU delegation; initiating comprehensive political dialogue; stabilising South Sudan and the joint border through specific measures and instruments – including the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Instrument for Stability – and increasing development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the latter, the EU has just made additional funds totalling EUR 200 million available for South Sudan, making our envelope today roughly EUR 300 million. We are working together with the Member States in a joint EU programming exercise to maximise the impact on the ground. At the same time, we will continue humanitarian assistance and we will work to ensure that trade is part of the comprehensive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">North Sudan, on the other hand, will suffer some losses. We need to support reform-minded elements in the North, promote an inclusive political dialogue and enhance our efforts to promote human rights. We are trying to step up our political dialogue with the government in Khartoum. My recent visit was intended to signal EU re-engagement following Khartoum’s positive response to the outcome of the referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, extremely concerned about the recent violence and, as I said, the military occupation of the city of Abyei, which constitutes a clear violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). We urge the parties to abstain from any further provocation and to negotiate the conditions for the long-term peaceful coexistence of local communities living in and around Abyei.</p>
<p class="contents">We also continue to have concerns about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protestors. One of the basic principles of the CPA was the establishment of democratic governments based on respect for diversity and basic freedoms. We want to see respect for fundamental freedoms and genuinely inclusive democratic governments in both North and South Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also mention Darfur. The European Union remains deeply concerned about the continued violence in Darfur, leading to displacements, and the severe impact this is having on humanitarian operations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is positive news. The three European citizens who were held hostage in Darfur for several months have been released but, at the same time, we know the situation in Darfur is as it has been previously. We will need to continue to support efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in Darfur, trying to secure a positive outcome from the peace negotiation process and create enabling conditions on the ground for a Darfur-based political process. We welcome the outcome of the recent All Stakeholders Conference in Doha and hope it will provide for such important developments towards lasting peace in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must mention justice. A lasting peace in Darfur cannot be achieved without justice and reconciliation. There has to be an end to impunity. The Council has repeatedly recalled the obligation of the government of Sudan to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1593. The Darfur people deserve to achieve what they have been longing for for so long – lasting peace and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People were happy because for once, they were having their say. For once, after more than 20 years of war, they felt that what they had to say would be listened to.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not disappoint these six million South Sudanese people, but we must not forget the inhabitants of the North either. It is important that, amid the democratic impetus brought about by the results of the referendum, negotiations should be as transparent as possible, so as to provide a solid base for the future development of each of the new states, as well as the future development of relations between them and with the international community. The viability and stability of both North and South are crucial. It is vital for solutions to be found at last to problems that have hitherto remained unresolved. I am talking about the problems of citizenship, sharing debt and oil revenues and the difficult matter of undefined borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the referendums must go ahead in the Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions, within the framework of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The situation in Abyei is becoming worse every day. It is most worrying. Abyei must not reach a point of no return that would undo more than six years of negotiations. Tensions that are turning into open conflict are threatening to overshadow South Sudan’s independence and plunge the region once again into chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation in Abyei must not make us forget the situation in Darfur. In this respect, the conclusions of the Doha conference must be taken into consideration, as you have just said, Commissioner, and we must not lose sight of the ongoing need to channel humanitarian aid and guarantee the safety of aid workers. Transparent negotiations are a guarantee of two viable states, as are the cessation of violence and effective cooperation between the two states.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the framework, of course, that was already outlined during the referendum process It is important that this continues, so as to ensure that the political will of both states and of the international community is put into practice in the form of genuine development projects for citizens of both countries. It is these citizens and their well-being that should be the main focus of democratisation, political pluralism, and respect for human rights and for religious, cultural and ethnic diversity in both South and North Sudan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Piebalgs, I had prepared a three-minute speech. However, while listening to you, I wondered if I should actually speak. I must complement you: I think Parliament has reason to be proud of the action by the whole of the European Union and of the way in which this Sudanese affair has been conducted, and like the Sudanese people, I am keeping my fingers firmly crossed that this will continue into independence and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke on the main issues, that is to say, the Abyei issue, which is still unresolved, the political decisions that were supposed to have been made on citizenship, debt, currency, etc. Above all, you mentioned everything you are hoping to do in terms of development, humanitarian action, the fact that justice must be done and that we must not sell the International Criminal Court short. In fact, you covered all the most important points.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just add a few points. As regards the problem of development and humanitarian action, it is true that so much still remains to be done in South Sudan and that we must continue to develop the North and, most importantly, not to isolate it. So much is still to be done because the country has lived purely off oil. It has not developed a diversified economy; there is no education; there are no roads, no hospitals, and so forth. The needs and expectations of the people are huge, and if we do not want these people to be disappointed with independence, then development and humanitarian action must continue for a long time yet. We must keep this firmly in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of human rights, women’s rights and political pluralism, polygamy still exists, even in the South. Women are bought along with cows; 80% of women are illiterate; children’s rights have yet to be introduced and political pluralism does not exist: there is no culture of political pluralism, as we saw during the elections and the referendum. At the same time, it is exciting and wonderful.</p>
<p class="contents">I met with both the South Sudanese and North Sudanese electoral commissions, though especially that of the South. They want to create laws. They want a good constitution, they want to build their country, and they are telling us, ‘we will have money, don’t worry, but help us – be there’. I think that in this respect, you have fulfilled their request. Your visit and that of Mrs Georgieva in the past and the probable visit of Lady Ashton for the independence celebrations are all major events.</p>
<p class="contents">Your wish to present a strategic plan for South Sudan is what we call for after every election. We do not want it to be a flash in the pan, but to have proper follow-up and a future for the countries we visit. I completely changed the text of my speech for all of this, Mr Piebalgs. I would like to thank you, because as I said, it is good to be able to be proud of the European Union, especially during this difficult time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to believe that, once a democratic decision is taken in the referendum, South Sudan will resolve its outstanding issues with its northern neighbour by peaceful means, that is, through negotiation. We want to believe that the region will avoid the risk of disputes and clashes erupting because of the borders, demographics and migration patterns due to oil and other natural resources, which are plentiful in both countries, statistically poor though they may be.</p>
<p class="contents">I call your attention to the need for continued cooperation on the part of the international community, the UN, the African Union and the European Union in consolidating both countries, in securing peace and the building of institutions for a democratic and pluralistic South Sudan. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a challenge we face now, at a time when the entire wider region is experiencing a revival and opening up to the requirements and standards of modern times.</p>
<p class="contents">Sudan is once again facing a major historical turning point. All the agreements reached at the end of the bloody civil war have not yet become reality. The situation in the Abyei province is closer to a crisis than to peace, there is violence in Darfur, and Sudan needs our attention and generous help.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important fact is that the UN Security Council has renewed the mandate of the UNMIS mission in Sudan and will deploy additional peacekeepers in Sudan. Our message to the governments in Khartoum and Juba is that they should welcome the UN peacekeepers as friends and ensure their security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a country rich in natural resources, but it is also a country with the most awful social indicators. A child born in South Sudan today has a higher chance of dying in infancy than attending primary school. What a statistic that is. Food products provided by aid agencies and intended for distribution to the poor for free are now being sold on the market. We need to build capacity from the bottom up. They do not have a civil service. They do not have trained administrators. They do not have the infrastructure that is required for a modern ‘state-to-be’. They need the rule of law, they need good governance, they need transparency, they need our expertise as partners.

The unpleasant thing here is that South Sudan is actually inheriting a legacy from the past and that the raising of the flag or of a glass of champagne is possibly somewhat out of place, given the situation in which the South Sudanese find themselves. Now that Abyei has been incorporated into the North, the South Sudanese should be praised for taking a stance of refusing to be provoked. However, the question, of course, is how long that will last.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we, the international community, looked on as the issue of Abyei was left unresolved in the referendum is actually highly irresponsible and a recipe for war to start up again in future. The fact that UN troops will have to be sent again to re-establish peace is also something that we can safely assume. What I find particularly difficult is the issue of what do we talk about and what do we not? Let us consider the fact that Sudan is trying to influence the forthcoming referendum in Abyei by insisting that those herdsmen who spend part of their time there and part away from there are included in the count. Is it justified for South Sudan to argue that, no, they should not be counted, as they are not permanent residents? If that is the view you take, are you not then denying the herdsmen’s right to exist? It is a Catch 22 situation for which no answer can just be plucked from the air.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other factors to mention, too. Is South Sudan to be given a fair start? If so, the South Sudanese are surely, in fact, entitled to debt cancellation? The debts in question were run up by the regime in Khartoum, and no one can say that these debts served the people of the South well.</p>
<p class="contents">The other factor is how are we to deal with the riches beneath the ground in South Sudan? While we are at it, is South Sudan covered by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which audits freedom from corruption and examines which oil assets benefit the population? If not, how can we in Europe help? The one thing, after all, that really helps when it comes to European help for South Sudan – and, in fact, for the North – is actually trade and getting fair investments off the ground. We are all watching developments anxiously and I hope that we will once again be able to toast the liberty of South Sudan with the flag and a glass of champagne. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ultimate fragility of the peace process that has been set in motion is demonstrated by current events in Abyei.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict that has broken out is dramatic. The Northern army has occupied Abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight. I believe that we, the European Union, must help in a very tangible way as we did before and that this must take the form of getting food and humanitarian aid for the refugees moving as soon as possible and preparing the emergency humanitarian aid for the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Even without this escalation of the conflict, in South Sudan, over 40% of the population are already dependent on food aid. South Sudan will be one of the poorest countries on earth, and if we want the Millennium Development Goals to also take effect here, it is urgently necessary that the funding made available by the Council – EUR 200 million – should actually be spent on food security, education and health in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My group advocates the immediate withdrawal of the armed units of the North and the South from Abyei, adherence to the comprehensive peace agreement and recognition of the demilitarised zone. With a view to the extension of the UN mandate, which has been discussed, we are calling for the risks and problems, such as those that came to light in connection with the MONUC mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to be taken into account and evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">We are disappointed that no really strong call for debt cancellation and for an examination of foreign debts made it into this resolution. I find that regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I call on the High Representative to urgently press the Sudanese authorities to release the Christian, Hawa Abdalla Muhammad Saleh, who was arrested by the security service in a refugee camp in Darfur on religious grounds on 25 May. According to reports, Saleh was tortured after arrest and then taken to an unknown location in Khartoum, a personal tragedy that requires Europe to get involved.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, as a Member of the European Parliament, it hit me hard to read the sharp rebuke from an authority on the situation in Sudan who is an international observer in the so repeatedly troubled conflict region of Abyei that the diplomatic pressure from Europe on the murderous and war-hungry regime of President al-Bashir was ‘zero and badly coordinated’. This is a crushing rebuke, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the international community, including Europe, giving President al-Bashir, after occupying Abyei, a feeling of invulnerability once again? At this particular point in time, it is worth pointing out how weak a position al-Bashir is in domestically and that it is a more than opportune moment to apply international pressure to the regime. I hope, therefore, for European pressure on al-Bashir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I refer to a very specific matter: personally, I was not at all surprised that the referendum and its result were followed by an increase in hostilities – almost – caused by the Sudanese institutions and authorities, particularly in the Abyei region. It is typical of the constant stop-and-go Khartoum politics to hint at a solution and then to withdraw it, without any warning. This is what has produced the disaster that Sudan has become.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a suggestion: within the European External Action Service, we have created a department which deals specifically with humanitarian crises. This department must be alerted to Abyei now and not when we are faced with a huge disaster. It must be mobilised because it is a credible department, which has proved its worth, in the Libyan crisis for example. I believe that this department should be encouraged, today, to prepare a plan and to present it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, explaining how it intends to act, to enable us to understand how valuable European Union foreign policy can be when we all work together towards the best result.</p>
<p class="contents">My final recommendation concerns our relations with China; we hear from all quarters that China plays an important role in Sudan, making it sound like some kind of ghostly presence that we have to fear. Personally, at this particular moment, I advocate the need for very cautious yet favoured relations with China, through which we can assess whether, in addition to economic interests, it is also interested in getting to the heart of human rights issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A solution to the Abyei problem is needed urgently to prevent the escalation of armed conflict between Sudan and South Sudan. This conflict is jeopardising the peace process that should have followed the referendum of January 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">The firing of shots by militia men at a UN helicopter at the end of May was an outrageous and cowardly act; as outrageous as the call by the Khartoum government for UN Peacekeepers to withdraw after 9 July. The UN presence is more necessary than ever to help observe the parties and stabilise the region, thus preventing the conflict from expanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring a peaceful transition to independence in South Sudan also requires that the fight against impunity remains at the top of the EU agenda for both countries and for their unhelpfully meddling neighbours. The EU should not be tempted to make any potentially ‘convenient deals’ with President al-Bashir in exchange for forgetting that he and his henchmen must be brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to answer for the war crimes and the crimes against humanity committed against the Sudanese people in Darfur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the creation of this young state, what was previously considered an internal matter for Sudan has become an international affair. All relations with Khartoum, especially concerning security matters, will now be international affairs and it follows that they will come under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore applaud the way in which various parties are carrying out their tasks and, in this respect, it is worth mentioning some of the biggest immediate challenges that the newly created state will encounter. Firstly, among these parties, I must mention former South African President and President of the African Union, Thabo Mbeki, and the mediation he performed, and I think we should also emphasise the mediation role that our own special representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, has played.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new state’s adhesion to the Cotonou Agreement opens up new prospects for development cooperation and relations with the European Union. I think this is imperative and we must do everything we can to promote speedy ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the need to develop capacity to manage the mammoth problems that the new, still very fragile state is faced with. This also calls for attention from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is a need to also contribute to development in North Sudan, which we must not forget, and which is preparing to draw up a new constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the dreadful security situation in the Darfur region and the government’s unilateral wish to organise a referendum on its status on 1 July 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I welcome the personal involvement of our Commissioner for Development and his staff in this crucial phase. He has understood that this decisive period for the future of South Sudan also constitutes a test of strength for the European Union and others as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes. It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support. Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again. The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns. I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states. A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however. If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to.</p>

It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid.

As has already been said, South Sudan will proclaim its independence on 9 July 2011. The challenges are huge, both in terms of the new State’s internal organisation and in terms of its relations with Sudan at their shared borders and in the oil-rich Abyei region.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Sudan and South Sudan have enormous humanitarian needs to deal with. The primary challenges are security, reaching inhabitants in distress and respect for humanitarian principles. The crisis is far from over. It is vital that the international community maintains its presence and a very high level of humanitarian involvement. We must be very watchful of how the situation develops, as it is already dreadful but could get worse and pose a threat to stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that the development aid that is organised for South Sudan is coordinated with and complementary to humanitarian aid. The real importance of the link between urgency and development is highlighted in this context, in which state infrastructures are very weak and the humanitarian crisis is set to last. Development aid must therefore provide support for state infrastructures and increase the population’s access to basic services that are organised at the moment by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the events in South Sudan and the Abyei region must not make us overlook the situation in Darfur, which is considered to be the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The lives of millions of people still depend on outside aid.</p>

Yes, this will be a country with one of the highest infant mortality rates and lowest educational indicators in the world, necessitating fast-track accession to the Cotonou Agreement, with access to the European Development Fund and fair debt alleviation. But, just as the EU should be proud that we have contributed to a largely peaceful and credible referendum process – and I pay tribute to my colleague, Veronique De Keyser, for her personal leadership – the EU must give priority to helping South Sudan with its constitutional review process, entrenching a multi-party system and preventing corruption from taking any root from the start.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, for South Sudan, the 9 July date goes before everything else; for North Sudan, although the comprehensive peace agreement may be coming to an end, its obligations do not. The threat of violence remains, not just in South Sudan itself, but in the neighbouring Blue Nile and South Kordofan provinces of North Sudan, and still in Darfur. Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten.</p>
<p class="contents">I was privileged to be present in East Timor at the birth of the world’s first new state of this millennium.

The EU has rightly supported the CPAP’s process and referendum in South Sudan. However, the next few months will remain critical. South Sudan must be enabled to establish itself as a viable sovereign state. Even without a hostile neighbour to the north, South Sudan faces enormous developmental challenges. Infrastructure is largely non-existent. There is widespread intercommunal hostility. Health care indicators are amongst the worst in the world and the economy is almost completely dependent on oil exports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to increase EU developmental and humanitarian aid to South Sudan. However, South Sudan also needs the EU’s unequivocal support politically. The recent seizure of the disputed border region of Abyei by the Khartoum government suggests that President Bashir is still not fully reconciled to his country’s partition. Lastly, I am also hopeful that South Sudan will live up to its promise and be the first African Union country to re-recognise the stable and democratic Republic of Somaliland as an independent country also. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Various imperialist powers have been trying to exploit the oil and gold, copper and uranium deposits in Abyei for 20 years.

<p class="contents">I also witnessed the major expectations of the people who decided on the liberation of their country from bondage. Thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of what are known as internal displaced persons, who the decades-long fighting in the South had pushed into the refugee camps of the North, set off back to their former homes in the South.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, alongside the independence of their country, the people of South Sudan want, above all, to live in peace and find a way to a happier future after the decades of war in which millions of South Sudanese were forced to sacrifice their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The new state of South Sudan is due to officially become independent on 9 July, extending the family of states in our world. The starting conditions are as bad as can be conceived, and much has, of course, been said about this already. 70% of the population live as nomadic cattle farmers; 80% are illiterate; the dispute over Abyei is widening into a military conflict. There have already been deaths and woundings. As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January. The wounded and violated are hardly even counted.</p>
<p class="contents">Sudan was a failed state. There is a danger that the state of South Sudan will be a failed state from the very outset. I am of the firm conviction that, given the colonial history of these countries, Europe has a major obligation to this region. Together with the United Nations and the African Union, this situation calls for Europe’s common foreign policy, and it is also that policy’s chance to prove itself. This is not only about money, but also about supporting the frail and nascent civil society. We need to negotiate hard with those who hold the future of the country in their hands, namely, the tribal chiefs and the heads of the military groups, so that they do not dash the hopes of the people of their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, during this time, the disputes relating to the delimitation of the border and sharing the income from oil extraction have not been settled.

<p class="contents">As we know, although displaced inhabitants always leave very quickly, their return takes time and is all too often a source of considerable humanitarian and social problems. I therefore propose that the European Union should organise a monitoring mission as quickly as possible, along the lines of the work we did in the Balkans.

It was to mean the creation of a 54th state in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the events taking place at the moment have sort of dampened the enthusiasm. We must be very realistic and acknowledge that, at the present juncture, the peaceful division of Sudan is in jeopardy. The occupation of the disputed Abyei region by Sudanese government forces on 21 May and the violence which continued yesterday, as well in Kadugli, show us that the civil war between north and south can reignite at any time. This must, of course, be avoided at all costs and our message must be loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The military operations being carried out by the Sudanese Government and the militia in Abyei mark a serious violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. I sincerely believe that we are all definite about one thing: any escalation of violence must be avoided, as it could result in further human casualties. The security situation must be resolved according to the Kadugli and Abyei agreements from the start of the year, including, in my view, through the intervention of a mixed security force commissioned by the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">If these obstacles are overcome, numerous question marks still remain about the viability of the two states which should coexist on the territory of the former Sudan. Political will and readiness for dialogue are needed because there is a whole series of issues which remain unresolved: common borders, citizenship, international obligations and, of course, the oil resources.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I want to highlight the deterioration in the human rights situation and rule of law in Sudan where we have recently seen an increase in arbitrary arrests. I cannot help but remind you that Omar al-Bashir is still subject to an international arrest warrant, a fact which the authorities in this country ignore.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on a positive note. I want to welcome the release of the three Bulgarian hostages who worked for the UN Humanitarian Air Service and were abducted from Darfur in January. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it needs to be stressed that this is only an opportunity, because that state today is lacking in basic attributes which should be a feature of every state. It lacks structures and competent officials, and does not have a judicial system. In other words, the way also lies open for the action of various forces which could undermine peace and security there. In this context, I think that as well as the very important humanitarian aid, it is also necessary to safeguard security, and that the current UN forces are still needed there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the political leaders must respect the will of the people expressed through the referendum on independence.

I want to stress the particularly difficult situation facing the population in the conflict zones. There is the risk of triggering a humanitarian disaster if members of the international community are not going to intervene.</p>

<p class="contents">Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European Development Fund will not be available until sometime after accession to the agreement. There is therefore a risk of a funding gap appearing in the period immediately after the referendum, when South Sudan will be very vulnerable and at considerable risk of national collapse. It is clearly necessary to prevent this because of the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe, and we should therefore do everything in our power to help the Sudanese get through this critical period and to prevent a repeat of the bloody conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a truly grotesque undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the differing views on property and belonging that made Abyei the bone of contention of a civil war that lasted for decades; there are also the differing religions, namely the Muslim North versus the Christian and nature-based religions of the South Sudanese, who were forced together by the haphazard borders drawn up by the former colonial powers. When considering the most recent escalations, this should not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">It would never have been possible to push the referendum through while the status of the voters of Abyei remained unresolved. Similarly, we must not forget the equally disputed regions of Blue Nile and South Kordofan with the Nuba mountains.

I will just run through a couple of elements that were raised in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of North and South Sudan are undoubtedly the masters of their countries. We are supporting the process, but the referendum definitely represents a watershed: it is a completely new qualitative situation. It is not the same situation as before. Yes there is violence, there are difficulties, but the situation is different. Now we see a light at the end of the tunnel. So that is why I would say that it is a great victory for us because we supported the process politically, both through our own actions and in financial terms. So that is a completely new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We never compromised on human rights or International Criminal Court issues. Our position is very clear with regard to both the ICC and human rights. Whenever there is a violation of human rights, the High Representative makes very strong and clear statements and puts pressure on the authorities. It has been said that there is no immediate response, but changes are being made. It is not an easy process and we will continue to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">On Abyei, the situation is difficult, but again the European Union position will be a very clear and strong condemnation of the occupation calling for the situation to be resolved immediately. It is basically up to the United Nations Security Council to decide on the situation. It will decide if there is to be another mission and if there is a United Nations Security Council resolution, we will be its greatest supporters.</p>
<p class="contents">But what we need to bear in mind is our strong political stance and declaration and our support for civilian operations. I believe, as I said to South Sudan, that we should not expect all the issues to be resolved by 9 July. Independence will be declared, there will be ongoing discussions, and the important element is that the African Union Panel, chaired by Thabo Mbeki, has support from both sides, North and South. We are very firmly behind the Mbeki panel. So we have every reason to believe that all the difficult questions will be answered.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the debt issue, work is under way as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. This takes time and the Abyei issue certainly did not help. But that issue has not been forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">China, in as much as we can involve it, is a fully-fledged member of the Security Council and it would be a great help in finding solutions in the country. At this stage, I cannot claim that there has been a lot of activity with the Chinese. They are in oil, they are in the North of Sudan, but it is definitely a great help when the broader international community tries to find a solution to the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I am very grateful for your interest in Sudan. On the one hand, it is rather far from us but, on the other, it is very close. If things go wrong, if people are dying in Africa, the European Union cannot stay on the outside saying ‘well, it is too far’. Your broad interest in the issues definitely encourages both the High Representative and myself to put together efforts to help people build peaceful lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has seen numerous conflicts since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1956. With the signing of the Naivasha Agreement and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) (2005), 20 years of conflict between the north and south formally came to an end. In January 2011, as provided for in the CPA, a referendum marked the last leg of the road towards the independence of the south from northern Sudan. In this extremely delicate transition phase, we must keep a balanced approach to both north and south, with particular attention to the needs of the south regarding institution building and governance. The aid given by the EU to South Sudan must be measured in terms of the effective capability of this new state to absorb it. Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption. Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title25"></a><a name="creitem25"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carlos Coelho, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make six brief points. Firstly, on strengthening Schengen: the free movement of people is one of the greatest successes and achievements of the EU, and Schengen is one of the Union’s major pillars. We are therefore among those who believe that it should not be weakened, but rather preserved and strengthened. I agree with the remarks that Commissioner Malmström made to this effect a little while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The five original Member States have given way to the current 25: 22 within the Union, and three outside it. Free movement is thus guaranteed within a territory of almost 43 000 km of external maritime borders and more than 7 700 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on mutual trust: the abolition of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between the Member States. There needs to be a rapid and adequate exchange of information through the Schengen Information System (SIS), good police cooperation and effective controls in place at the external borders. The security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency with which each Member State carries out checks at its external borders. If this does not happen, the security of the Schengen area is weakened, the credibility of the European Union is undermined and mutual trust is destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on equal rules: there should also be trust in the procedures, which must be clear and fair. Candidate countries must be able to implement and enforce all the Schengen criteria effectively and correctly: the same criteria that were demanded of previous candidate countries; no more, no less.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on transparency: we need to ensure greater transparency, in the interests of both freedom and security. I regret that, once again, the Council has not acted as it should in relation to Parliament, denying Members of this House access to the evaluation reports. The problem could only be overcome thanks to the diligence of the ambassadors of Romania and Bulgaria, who requested the declassification of the reports and their submission to Parliament, so enabling Members of this House to have access to the content of the evaluations, recommendations and final conclusions. Unfortunately, the Council has failed to respect Parliament once again. This very transparency is needed to address the outstanding problems that have been pointed out, as although these are not an obstacle to the two countries’ full membership of Schengen, they should be subject to monitoring by the evaluation committee so as to verify that the recommendations have been acted upon, along with any changes that are still ongoing. Parliament demands access to this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on European citizenship: how often do we invoke the value of European citizenship during our speeches? Since their accession to the EU, in 2007, both Bulgaria and Romania have had a legitimate expectation that their citizens would become fully fledged EU citizens and that they would be able to enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens, including freedom of movement within the Schengen area. This is the European citizenship that we are strengthening by extending the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth and final point is that they have worked hard. It is clear that both countries are to be congratulated on the efforts they have made towards meeting all the requirements of Schengen. This is clear in the evaluation reports and in subsequent observations by the expert missions that made the evaluation. It was also clear during the mission that we made to Bulgaria and Romania, and for this I would like to thank my fellow Romanian Members, Mr Marinescu, Mr Enciu and Mrs Weber, and my fellow Bulgarian Members, Mr Kovatchev and Mrs Nedelcheva. We are therefore able to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area, and I hope that the Council will adopt the same position as soon as it receives our positive opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enikő Győri, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, I am particularly glad of the opportunity to participate on behalf of the Council in the debate on the extension of the Schengen area to Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a consistently high priority for the Hungarian Presidency. I am therefore especially pleased that by now, both Bulgaria and Romania have received positive evaluation of their technical preparedness to apply the entirety of the Schengen acquis. We welcome the fact that the assessment by this Parliament has also led to similar conclusions. I particularly commend the work of the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his professional and personal dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">For a moment, allow me to deviate from the protocol for the sake of a historic reference. When the accession of Hungary and other new Member States from Central Europe to Schengen was hampered by a technical difficulty related to the development of the Schengen Information System, the SIS II, it was the then Portuguese Presidency that helped us with a generous and inventive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Chair, Mr López Aguilar, and all the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, for their commitment to this issue. The Hungarian Presidency has made considerable efforts to take this dossier forward. The Presidency became aware early on that there was a need to address persistent reservations on the part of a number of Member States vis-à-vis the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency therefore put the state of play of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen on the agenda of the JHA Council meeting on 24 and 25 February. On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Presidency’s conclusions on the progress made and the need to continue to work in close cooperation with all Member States towards a solution acceptable to all parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Bulgaria and Romania have taken very significant steps to bring their countries’ policy and practice up to the Schengen standards. These include areas such as data protection, police cooperation, the control of external air, sea and land borders, the issuing of visas and the appropriate implementation of the SIS and SIRENE functions. In the meantime, the Schengen evaluation of Romania and Bulgaria on all chapters was completed in March with a positive outcome. Following the adoption of the relevant reports by the relevant Council working party, the Presidency submitted draft conclusions on the completion of the evaluation process to the JHA Council scheduled for 9 June.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this will be good news for most in this House, not least those Members from Bulgaria and Romania. It will mark an important step on their way towards full participation in Schengen. The Council will continue to monitor further progress in all areas since proper follow-up is an ongoing exercise in all Schengen countries. In this respect, I can assure the honourable Members that both Bulgaria and Romania will continue to report regularly on the steps taken to remedy the remaining shortcomings. They will, in particular, be looking to reinforce further the controls at their borders and to improve cross-border police cooperation as well as their systems for the issuing of visas.</p>
<p class="contents">When Parliament adopts the report prepared by Mr Coelho and the Council adopts the conclusions drafted by the Presidency, only the very last step – adopting the decision of the Council which, as we all know, requires unanimity – will be left. In this respect, I would like to underline that the Council may return to this issue very soon to reflect on how it can further the process, possibly in September this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report prepared by the rapporteur touches upon the subject of access to classified documents – as was also mentioned by the rapporteur in his introductory remarks – which was an important question in dealing with this dossier. Parliament’s access to classified documents is one of the outstanding interinstitutional issues between the Council and Parliament that the Hungarian Presidency is aiming to resolve. While we have managed to agree on the way forward with Parliament’s delegations, the implementation of the solution found still requires some time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Hungarian Presidency looked, right at the beginning of its term, for an immediate solution in order not to delay the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. In that context, it was at the proposal of the Hungarian Presidency that the Council gave its assent so that Parliament could have access to documents pertinent to the accession of the two Member States to the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Hungarian Presidency is convinced that the enlargement of the Schengen area to include Bulgaria and Romania, now that they meet all the technical and legal criteria, would be beneficial for the entire Schengen cooperation and for Europe as a whole, where one could travel from the Black Sea to the Atlantic without being stopped to show a passport or identity card. We all know that this free movement is one of the fundamentals of our European Union – something which is really tangible for our citizens and something of value which we all have to safeguard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the most tangible gifts that the European institutions have given to Europe’s citizens – the fact that, as the Presidency said, you can actually drive from Finland to Portugal without stopping at any border control. We must safeguard Schengen and the latest debate on reintroducing borders must be stopped. We have already discussed on many occasions how we should strengthen Schengen, and not weaken it. We need more Europe on this, and not less Europe. We need better evaluation, better tools and better guidelines and recommendations on how to interpret the Schengen acquis. This will be discussed with Member States in the Council this week, but also later at the European Council at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Romania and Bulgaria on the considerable efforts they have made. I have seen with my own eyes that they have done a lot of hard work. One of the advantages of being late is that you can benefit from the latest technology. I have been impressed by the technology and the work that has been put in place by Romania and Bulgaria and I would like to congratulate them on these investments. The result is that they both now meet the technical criteria of Schengen and they are committed and deserve the trust of the European Union. The Commission welcomes this report on the work by Romania and Bulgaria and I would like also to thank Mr Coelho and the shadow rapporteurs for this report and this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always taken the line that there is no formal link between the CVM mechanism and Schengen accession. But, of course, we all know that access to Schengen is also based on trust, and trust, or lack of trust, has been very much debated in the last weeks. The decision to lift internal border controls with Romania and Bulgaria must not only be based on the technical evaluation but also on this trust, and unfortunately, that trust is not there today. That is why it was so important, as the Presidency outlined, to work with Member States to find a swift solution to this so that borders could be lifted as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This must remain a priority. The Council, which has the say on this, must define a clear framework with clear timetables related to border control so that Romania and Bulgaria can see a way forward. They have demonstrated that they are ready to join, that they have made the necessary progress, and hopefully there will very soon be a possibility to achieve a way forward and a decision by the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania. I trust Bulgaria and Romania. They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right – this is no gift.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs. I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal.</p>
<p class="contents">These criteria essentially number five. They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land. Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE).</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe. Furthermore, we should avoid double standards. Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council.</p>

I also thank the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Malmström for the support they have given to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate about Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area has been hijacked so much for political purposes that we have almost forgotten what it is we are really debating. I want to remind everyone that we are actually talking about very clear, specific criteria which any candidate country has to meet to become a member of the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no moral or legal argument which will make us change the rules for joining now at the end. The rules can be improved when approving the new Schengen evaluation mechanism applicable to all Member States, without resorting to double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for us to be honest and acknowledge that Romania and Bulgaria are being held responsible for everything that is going wrong at EU level and internally in some Member States. This notion is completely unacceptable. It is not Romania and Bulgaria that are at fault because the European Union and certain Member States are unable to manage immigration and their borders, nor are they responsible for the extremist and populist deviations of a few governments, applying anti-immigration policies and regarding the mobility of European citizens, especially of Roma citizens, as a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens have to suffer because of the bad personal relations the national authorities have with certain influential leaders. The EU institutions must be the voice of reason and combat this distraction which some are attempting to create. The European Parliament and Council must comply with European legislation, while the Commission has to oversee this as Guardian of the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for the extremely professional manner in which he has carried out his job in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, so as to ensure that these principles are respected. It has been a pleasure for me to work with Mr Coelho, whose constructive attitude has left its mark on the whole dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we are dealing with an issue of principle when we examine whether two EU Member States fulfilling the criteria for joining the Schengen area should be admitted to this area. The answer according to the rules is ‘yes’. Both countries have been assessed regarding their technical preparation for this accession, with totally positive conclusions. Our rapporteur has gone even further and organised off his own bat working visits to the countries, also accompanied by the shadow rapporteurs, so that they can see how both the command centres and some border points look technically.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, another issue of principle has been to do with the institutional relations between the European Parliament and Council when it came to MEPs accessing documents on the basis of which they had to vote. The Council’s viewpoint that only some MEPs could have access and vote on a fully informed basis, while the others ought to raise their hands to copy them, was sharply criticised by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I am pleased that our viewpoint won the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional cooperation must be fair, logical and democratic. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will send a clear, positive message to MEPs about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we do not push further forward at a speed and rate we are not fully prepared for. This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I must stress that this debate should not be used as an excuse to criticise either Bulgaria or Romania, who we know have been working very hard to meet the technical criteria that the Commission has set. Although there may well be disagreement between us as to whether those criteria have been met, much has been done. But this is an opportunity to talk about renewing faith in the Schengen system and the integrity of the European Union itself, and an opportunity to improve a completely outdated and ineffective evaluation mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently dealing with a system which is not able to deal with the current or future challenges Europe faces or the political views of its Member States. Now is the time to set criteria which not only deal with the technical aspects of the Schengen system, but assess the impact of organised crime and corruption, also within the assessment of existing Schengen Member States, and I would like to see Europol and Eurojust involved in those assessments. Perhaps such a new evaluation mechanism would help prevent some of the differences of opinion and lack of confidence in the current system which we are hearing not only in this Chamber but right across Europe at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself come from a new Member State and I remember how it wanted to join the area. I therefore very much welcome the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to that area.</p>
<p class="contents">There were some shortcomings on the road to Schengen, but now the problems are resolved. Bulgaria and Romania are fully prepared to join the area of free travel in 2011. I understand the concerns about corruption and organised crime. That is why cooperation within the framework of the mechanism for cooperation and verification should be continued. However, we cannot invent new criteria for joining the Schengen area and we cannot undermine the certainty that a state is part of that area as soon as current criteria are met.</p>
<p class="contents">The debates in Parliament have revealed a clear need to avoid double standards when evaluating the implementation of the Schengen acquis in existing and acceding Schengen Member States. The file on that evaluation is thus crucial. We find it unacceptable that several Member States have suggested, in the Council, changing the legal bases for the proposal so as to exclude Parliament from the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope very much that our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, will defend Parliament’s prerogatives, as he always does very successfully, with our full support. I would like to thank him for his work and hope for further good cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Think about it – the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union. For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States – including my home country of Germany – totally incomprehensible. The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered. Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here. For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council’s impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents. Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one. We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, ‘The Romanians are euphoric citizens. They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics’. That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, we believe that there would be an urgent need to establish regulatory and operational conditions preventing undesirable elements, who could undermine the security of Member States, from slipping into the EU unnoticed via Bulgaria and Romania, but our assessment is that those conditions do not exist today.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports being discussed in Parliament are not reassuring because of the grave deficiencies which still exist at air, land and sea borders, starting with the performance of border controls. It is not surprising that our police forces are faced with numerous cases of illegal immigrants coming from those two countries every day.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bulgaria and Romania, our corrupt eastern European nests of thieves, absolutely do not meet the conditions for accession to the Schengen area. I repeat: absolutely not. Commissioner Malmström may well idealistically muse how sacrosanct the Schengen acquis is, while the majority in Parliament may well drily consider how marvellous it would be if Bulgaria and Romania were to join the Schengen area, but it is just not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">It is naive, in fact, it is childishly naive. The facts just do not back the idea up. Bulgaria and Romania themselves have long since demonstrated that they are not worthy of accession to the Schengen area at this point. According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, corruption is the order of the day in both countries. When it comes to trustworthiness, Bulgaria scores just 3.6 on a scale of 1 to 10, while Romania comes in at 3.7. In a school report, these figures would be interpreted as a fail, a downright fail. Yet we are supposed to allow these countries into Schengen? Of course we should not – never!</p>
<p class="contents">The facts just do not back this idea up, either. In January of this year, a few dozen Bulgarian customs officials were arrested due to corruption. In February of this year, nearly 200 Romanian customs officials were arrested, also due to corruption. Both countries also have worryingly high scores when it comes to human trafficking. Last year, dozens of victims of Bulgarian and Romanian human trafficking were discovered in the Netherlands alone. Yet we are supposed to allow these countries into Schengen? It would be an outrage, and completely irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">You can want something to happen – you can want something to happen very badly – but you need to see the reality. Take the blinkers off! Bulgaria and Romania are absolutely not ready for Schengen. They are not ready now, and they never will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank the Presidency and Commission for their support on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The process for evaluating these countries and their accession must be completed according to the same criteria with which it started. It was already established in 2007 that, once the technical criteria were fulfilled, Bulgaria and Romania would join the Schengen area in 2011. This is already done. The same evaluation has been reached by the Council’s experts: Bulgaria and Romania fulfil the membership criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">All the reservations which we have recently been hearing relate to the foreign policy debates of some Member States. Instead of looking at the short term, we need to take action in support of better protection for our external borders, of signing and complying with readmission agreements with our southern and eastern neighbours, and of solidarity with those Member States which are subject to the strongest immigration pressure in southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly important at the moment when there are internal challenges from and fears among our citizens about illegal immigration, which may threaten security and social advantages in Europe. We need effective, workable plans for dealing with the crises which we had in Italy and Malta. We cannot allow double standards. If we are going to debate and adopt new rules, they must apply to all countries – both old and new.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members, Bulgaria and Romania have completed their job and they are building on these security systems in cooperation with their Schengen partners. They have made and are making considerable efforts in the fight against corruption and organised crime. At present, I will feel less concerned if the Schengen area’s Mediterranean border is guarded as well as Bulgaria and Romania guard their Black Sea borders. The rapporteur and other fellow Members were there and they understand what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Council needs to decide to admit Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area this September, in order to strengthen security in this area. Fellow Members, I call on you to support Mr Coelho’s report, which will allow us to give the Council a clear, strong political signal that Bulgaria’s and Romania’s rightful place is in the Schengen area this very year, in order to make external borders more secure and give our citizens greater peace of mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are over 900 000 gypsies in Romania and Bulgaria, many of whom would like to migrate. Once they can travel freely within the Schengen area, many of them will inevitably find their way to Britain in order to take advantage of our generous benefits and public housing system, like so many before them.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps some enterprising British citizens might like to meet the Roma as they disembark at Calais and Heathrow and give them the addresses and location maps so that they can find their way to the homes of our Prime Minister, his cabinet colleagues and all the MPs in favour of EU membership. Only when the Roma pitch their caravans on the front lawns of our out-of-touch political class might they change their views on the benefits of EU membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear, in any case, that there are various Member States that will oppose this. They have good reasons for so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a recent report from Europol about organised crime which stated that criminal groups from Albania, Turkey and the former Soviet Union will exploit the opportunities that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area will bring. The report I mention also makes reference to the visa liberalisation for the Balkan States, which was also something of an imprudent measure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the problem of illegal immigration via Turkey, which will occur in much greater numbers once Bulgaria is in the Schengen area. What guarantees is the Commission giving that this problem will be tackled effectively? It is giving none whatsoever. What steps is it taking to prevent additional problems in connection with the Roma gypsies and the nuisance and criminality associated with them? It is taking no steps whatsoever, either.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation when it comes to the judicial reform and anti-corruption measures that are still needed? Those citizens of Romania and Bulgaria who travel to Schengen countries with good intentions will, in any case – and I am convinced of this – understand that the inconvenience of border controls is outweighed by the necessity of protecting all other Europeans against organised crime and mass illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Romania has invested more than EUR 1 billion and the results have definitely been positive in all the evaluation reports. All the Schengen acquis conditions have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania manages one of the European Union’s longest external borders, as a result of which it has developed the most advanced, integrated security system, complying with the standards set by the Schengen acquis. Romania and the agency Frontex have strengthened their partnership. In the Frontex operations carried out in Greece, Romania was the second main contributor, after Germany, of equipment and human resources. In the event of a huge influx of immigrants at the border, specialist immigration and asylum mechanisms have been implemented in partnership with similar institutions in other Member States, Germany and the Netherlands. In terms of the efforts to combat illegal trafficking, every state-of-the-art method is used to investigate and collect information. A unique application has been developed in Europe which allows data to be processed in both SIS I and SIS II. The maritime border surveillance system has been presented as a model of good practice. At the same time, the authorities have focused particular attention on the fight against corruption. Constant cooperation as part of the special mechanism set up by the European Commission has produced the results showing that Romania has the necessary institutional capacity required and political will to achieve the justice objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU’s external borders. Mr Coelho, thank you and congratulations on the way you have handled this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union. But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area. A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime.

This acquis means a lot to Eastern and Central European countries, also for historical reasons, because it provides the opportunity to travel freely without barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important message of our debate today for Member States must be that Romania and Bulgaria meet the same accession criteria that the European Union expected from countries that have joined so far.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be emphasised that we cannot impose more requirements for Romania and Bulgaria than we have done in the case of the previous Schengen accession. Member States should not use the institution of double standard, as it erodes the very foundation upon which the Schengen acquis is built: the institution of mutual trust. It is exactly the events of recent months that prove that Europe’s most important acquis requires protection and support. I would also like to emphasise that under no circumstances should we bundle two matters here, that is, link the Schengen accession of the two Member States to the matter of the supervision of the Schengen verification mechanism. There is a great need for the latter, but the two cannot be connected right now.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, allow me to congratulate Mr Coelho who prepared the report, whose constructive and consistent work has been truly important in this matter. I would also like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for its commitment and the concrete steps it took to facilitate the accession of the two Member States as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me as a Social Democrat, it goes without saying that all EU Member States that meet all of the stringent requirements for cooperation should be allowed to join. It is, of course, important for us to lay down stringent requirements for joining Schengen, but the same objective criteria must apply to everyone. Anything else is political hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that all of the experts deem that Romania and Bulgaria satisfy requirements, I think it is clear that they should be allowed to join. Some objections have been raised this evening with regard to corruption in both countries, but that is not something that can be combated via the Schengen system. Just recently, Commissioner Malmström presented a package for combating corruption that we can use as a basis for further work. This is a matter for the whole of the European Union, not just for Romania and Bulgaria. Likewise, the fight against organised crime requires more cooperation, not more closed doors.</p>

<p class="contents">Bulgaria and Romania have done a considerable amount of work on strengthening their border controls and have succeeded. The latest assessments are very clear, in all areas from police and judicial cooperation to data protection and policies on visas and air, sea and land border controls. All the technical conditions have been met. We can accept this as an established fact. Bulgaria and Romania are now in a position to implement the Schengen acquis in terms of their technical capacity and human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst there is now nothing to prevent us from enlarging the Schengen area, it is worth noting the recommendations that have been made to these two countries. I hope these recommendations will be strictly monitored, especially as regards the borders between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, because as you know, mutual trust between the Schengen States relies on countries adhering fully to their reciprocal obligations. If any of the parties does not abide by its obligations, this breaks the closed circuit and the whole system falls down.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the Council reaches an agreement so that these two countries can become part of the privileged circle of Schengen States. All of us in this House are aware of the implications that decisions of this nature have for the citizens concerned. Well done again to Mr Coelho on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They meet the Schengen standards. Objective reviews have all come to the same conclusion, namely, that the prerequisites for accession to the Schengen area have been met. Our rapporteur also performed a review on the ground. He carried out an objective evaluation and reached the same conclusion. That is why we will not only be voting in favour of the report but we will also be giving our consent for both these countries to join the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Schengen area is also an area of confidence, however. That means that not everything is completed with a single, one-off action but that confidence must be built over the long run; investment in security must be ensured over the long term. The same applies to all States, I would point out, and not just to Romania and Bulgaria. I hope that this confidence remains secure over the long term so that we are able to maintain this freedom of travel, this freedom of movement within the European Union as a major public good over the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I am distressed by something that I heard today, however, although it is something that I am unable to verify, namely, that police wages in Romania are to be cut by around a third. We all know that it is a prerequisite for incorruptibility, for reputable work by the police, that they must be well paid. I therefore hope that my information is inaccurate and that the police, who are performing a service in the interests of these countries and of the security of the entire European Union, will continue to be well paid in the future, too, so that they are not susceptible to bribery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The correct response ought to be to strengthen the principle of solidarity regarding emigration policy and to get all Member States to commit to applying it.

However, the date of their accession to the Schengen area is still uncertain, as some Member States believe that despite the repeated assessments by various European Union institutions, their accession could cause problems in the Schengen system. While acknowledging the deficiencies of the Romanian justice system, I would like to call to the attention of my fellow Members and the Council the fact that the decision they are making directly influences the everyday lives of 30 million EU citizens. The abolition of internal border controls is an enormous success of European integration. Romanian and Bulgarian citizens rightly expect to be able to enjoy the benefits of the Schengen acquis as full European Union citizens.

On the one hand, given the current wave of immigrants from North Africa, where the EU is encouraging democratic change, some states have asked for, and obtained, a temporary suspension of those arrangements. On the other hand, other states have decided, for reasons which would seem to reflect their own narrow interests towards the applicants, to exploit the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are not yet part of the area and to try to keep them out, once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the rules of the game have been modified during the match, to the disadvantage of the two players. I personally support the positive conclusions of the report and praise the author for them but, although I can understand the political reasons for amending the recommendation – the basis of politics is, after all, compromise – I cannot ignore the fact that the new conditionality suggested might facilitate a subjective interpretation of it. I pray to God that I am wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is my firm belief that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to this area will not have an adverse impact on the borders’ security. Quite the opposite. It will boost Europeans’ confidence in the Schengen area. There is often talk about mutual trust, just as has been mentioned in this debate, too. However, how can we talk about mutual trust when some Member States are changing the rules of the game midway by introducing new criteria for joining Schengen?</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments being used today against Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area were not taken into account for any other state which has joined Schengen in the past. The only thing that Romanians and Bulgarians expect is fair treatment in relation to the other countries and an objective assessment based on the same criteria. Parliament must send the Council a clear message in this respect and insist on a definite date for accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fight against organised crime and the improvement of border protection must finally be more valued in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If Italy and its border police’s security system reportedly lags far behind the ordinary Schengen standard, it is to be feared that newcomers like Romania and Bulgaria could soon also slacken in their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The overhasty accession to Schengen for these countries should therefore be rejected, as the main beneficiaries of this could be organised crime from eastern Europe and even from the Caucasus region. I believe that, in combating asylum problems, Denmark has set itself up as a trailblazer for EU-wide rules. That is probably why the Commission has reacted so strongly to the announcement of stronger border controls to fight rising criminality.

There is indeed a clear need to strengthen the trust and faith in Schengen by strengthening governance and by strengthening the evaluation mechanism – as the Commission proposed long before Christmas – with more involvement of independent experts and the Commission, and also increased transparency involving Parliament in all the steps that are taken there. We also need to become much better in immediately assisting Member States which are in difficulties for one or other reason, and we need to clarify under what circumstances border controls might be reintroduced.</p>
<p class="contents">All this needs to be done. We also need to fight against corruption and to increase the fight. Yes, there is corruption in Bulgaria and Romania, but there is corruption in every Member State, and the Commission proposed only yesterday a report on how we want to enforce the struggle against corruption. Some of you were kind enough to refer to this.</p>
<p class="contents">But, in the meantime, we must recognise the enormous efforts that have been made by Bulgaria and Romania in order to comply with the technical requirements of Schengen. They are very clear, they are very transparent. That is why these countries must be given a clear perspective, a clear framework on what is expected of them, so that Member States will feel ready to welcome them into the Schengen community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was very important for us to feel your support throughout the entire past five months. Today’s debate has also shown clearly that there is a strong majority in the European Parliament supporting Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the Schengen area because they have done their homework.</p>
<p class="contents">During the past five months, and for the remaining time ahead of us, we will fight to express this, and for the Council to determine that as far as the technical standards are concerned, Romania and Bulgaria are ready to join the Schengen area. Both countries have worked very hard and deserve the maximum amount of appreciation for their efforts. Many have voiced their opinion during the debate – those who are for, as well as those who are against or for postponing the accession – that mutual trust is the key word in this issue. I also agree strongly with this, and the Hungarian Presidency has aimed to build trust throughout the entire time.</p>
<p class="contents">How did we try to achieve this? On the one hand, we were engaged in continuous dialogue with both countries, watching their efforts and attempting to help them find ways to get a better recognition of their efforts. On the other hand, we were continuously in touch with countries that expressed doubts about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. We then made efforts to encourage these countries to contact the candidate countries as well. As a result, I can tell you that there was a continuous dialogue behind the scenes in order for the parties to better understand and trust one another. This is the mutual trust upon which the majority of our policies are built in the European Union; without it, Member States are unable to make this political decision that requires unanimity. This is a time-consuming process.</p>
<p class="contents">We had six months to achieve this. I trust that during these six months, we will reach the point where, in exactly two days, the Member States will say ‘yes, the homework has been done’. What can help create mutual trust? On the one hand, the series of consultations, which I have mentioned. On the other hand, that both candidate countries continue their efforts and keep proving that they are capable of defending the external borders of the European Union. The conduct exhibited by these two countries, coupled with their enormous growth, pace and rhythm, must be continued in the near future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am convinced that the cooperation and verification mechanism – the famous CVM on which the Commission will release a report in July, dealing with the exact same issues that were voiced in this debate – could be helpful, even if officially, it is not part of the conditions for Schengen accession. The Commission will issue a certificate concerning the fight against organised crime and corruption. We have fought all along for this not to be laid down as a condition, but it will definitely support the building of mutual trust. As such, I am convinced that a positive CVM will promote a positive political decision regarding the Schengen expansion as well.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask me about the general mood regarding any type of admission into the Schengen area, then we all know that it would be difficult to say that the European Union is currently in a particularly welcoming mood. Several comments have been made in this debate that aptly demonstrate this. For instance, some are saying that with the Romanian-Bulgarian accession, the Roma population will begin to move from these two countries. I would like to be very clear: freedom of movement is a basic principle of the European Union, it is effective and valid, it is what our policies are built upon; this freedom is currently enjoyed by the Romanian and Bulgarian Roma population, just as by everyone else in every corner of the European Union. Everyone can move freely, there are no visa requirements, and if anyone wanted to leave now, they could.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am very proud of the fact that a Roma strategy was devised during the Hungarian Presidency which determines clearly the obligations of every Member State in connection with the community of this difficult fate. The problem must be treated at its roots: by providing better employment and education opportunities for them, this internal migration pressure will also decrease within the European Union. And allow me one more comment: if anyone were to deny one of our most basic freedom rights from the weakest, then these rights would be in jeopardy for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, since the ongoing evaluation of the Schengen system has been discussed at length as well, I would like to say that the Hungarian Presidency has already stated this very clearly from the first moment, and this is something we continue to believe in. The issue of the Schengen expansion must be clearly separated from the type of evaluation to which we will subject the Schengen system. Let us not confuse the two. We must preserve the acquis regarding the freedom of movement, and we must utilise our available means better, for instance, to ensure a better mutual control of our external borders. This is why we are working on the Frontex Regulation; this is why we are working on reducing the migratory pressure from North Africa by addressing its local causes; this is why there is a new neighbourhood policy; this is why we are working on increasing the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank. We are in the final hour. There is only one legal problem standing in the way of reaching an agreement with you: the usual ‘delegated act’ problem. It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that the forthcoming session of the Justice and Home Affairs Council to be held in two days’ time will make important decisions concerning both the expansion and the verification aspects of the Schengen issue, but in a way that guarantees the freedom of movement of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally disagree. I believe that when we become adults, we appreciate rational arguments, and if we have been well educated, we recognise when rational arguments are fair. In order to act fairly, we cannot compromise ourselves with double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to ask whether Bulgaria and Romania do or do not meet the conditions for entry into Schengen. If they do meet them, then they should enter. It is perfectly legitimate for their citizens to be seen as full European citizens. The people of Bulgaria and Romania should not become hostage to populist rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that not everything is as it should be with regard to Schengen. We are therefore advocating a new system of evaluation for Schengen in order to be able to identify problems, respond accordingly, and make decisions if the problems persist. However, debates on the new evaluation system for Schengen cannot hold the people of Bulgaria and Romania hostage to this legislative process. These are different processes, and each has its own pace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Gyõri, thank you very much for your kind mention of Portugal and the Schengen Information System (SIS) one-for-all scheme, which has facilitated the entry of several countries, including yours, into the Schengen area. Thank you for reminding us of that and for making that nice mention. I would like the Council to be given a summary of this debate and, I hope, an outline of our votes tomorrow, which I believe will be very enlightening. I hope that Council will recognise that when the assembly representing European citizens says yes with a large majority to Bulgaria and Romania, as I hope it will, the Council should follow suit as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we must respect the right of all European Union citizens without exception to move freely. If Bulgaria and Romania are subject to more criteria than other EU Member States in order to join the Schengen area, then we will be creating double standards. We must avoid a system based on double standards, which is very strict towards candidate countries and very soft on countries that are already members of the Schengen area. The rules of the Schengen acquis must be the same for all countries and the assessment system must be based on the provision that rules should be met continuously, not only during accession. Countries joining the Schengen area must continue to comply with all security requirements because the security of the Schengen area really depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders, as well as on the quality and speed with which information is exchanged through the Schengen Information Service. Therefore, in order to remove controls at internal borders, it is necessary for the Member States to cooperate as much as possible and take the necessary action, particularly when increasing migration flows, because the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Joining the Schengen Agreement and dismantling borders is the step that citizens appreciate the most of the European Union’s acquis; in addition to the euro, this is also the symbol of the European Union. Freedom of movement is one of the keys to the success of the common market. It is, of course, necessary to safely protect the external borders of the European Union, yet this objective is achieved not by keeping out Member States that are prepared but by introducing a continuous and transparent Schengen verification system, which – along with the common European migration policy and the refugee policy based on internal solidarity – represents a solution to many open questions.

Following the visits made on the ground and the technical evaluations which were carried out, not only the rapporteur appointed by the European Parliament but the group of experts, too, concluded that Romania fulfils all the criteria for joining the Schengen area, which were provisions assumed through the Treaty of Accession in 2005. All the shortcomings identified in the past have been rectified. Furthermore, my country has set an example of good practice in some areas. With regard to the objections raised by some MEPs, I want to point out that they relate to topics which have no direct link with the Schengen acquis, which means that they cannot be used as reasons for blocking Romania’s access to this area. I understand the concerns of certain fellow Members about making the EU’s external borders secure, especially as some states can be regarded as favourite destinations for the flows of emigrants. However, I should remind you that European rules must be the same for all Member States and cannot be changed during the game as this would amount to discrimination against Romanian citizens. In view of the positive technical evaluation, the Justice and Home Affairs Council must give the green light to Romania’s integration into Schengen, from this autumn on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, those of us who are familiar with the Europol report OCTA 2011 on the subject of organised crime will be asking ourselves whether the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is deaf and blind, and why on earth we indulge ourselves in Europol at all if we simply ignore its warnings. Europol reports that Romania and Bulgaria are transit routes for drug smuggling, gun running and human trafficking. Organised criminal gangs, increasingly multi-ethnic, act with extreme violence. Many have a paramilitary background. These groups, and I quote verbatim from the Europol report ‘are seeking to expand their interests in the EU, and may exploit opportunities in the possible accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Zone’. Europol Director, Rob Wainwright, stated in an interview that ‘The possible accession into Schengen of Bulgaria and Romania and visa liberalisation for Ukraine – one would see these as potential new opportunities for organised crime’. We have a duty to our citizens to take Europol’s warnings seriously. The Schengen Agreement is already opening all the doors to Europe to organised crime and illegal immigration. It therefore needs urgent repair before it is extended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The existence of effective controls along our external borders must be an important factor inasmuch as the security of the Schengen area depends on the efficiency with which each Member State controls its external borders. Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis. We have discussed at length the practical efficacy of the state machinery of these two countries, as well as their levels of corruption; nevertheless, I believe that the application of Schengen should leave this out of consideration, given that – just as happened with the other Member States – it is sufficient to base a decision only on the efficiency of border controls and the preparation of police forces. Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against the background of the global economic crisis, the EU is experiencing a crisis of democracy and solidarity. We are seeing the renationalisation of Europe. In this context, the debate on Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the Schengen area has provoked stark reactions motivated by pseudo-arguments and double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about technical aspects, nor about the security of the EU’s external borders, nor yet about migration or efficiency of the judiciary. It is a European political problem of a strategic character. It is about EU cohesion. To speak about a lack of preparation at our eastern borders when seeing the permeability of our southern borders is simply hilarious. To promote national political agendas at the expense of the aspirations of EU citizens of Bulgarian and Romanian origin is outrageous. Indeed, we need better defended borders, a better migration policy, better administrative capacity and honest public servants. But this requires more and not less Europe. One right step in this direction is the immediate enlargement of the Schengen area to include Romania and Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our country has fulfilled, albeit late, all the technical requirements relating to external border controls.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a large degree of distrust suggesting that serious disruption may be caused when the control measures are implemented. This distrust features in the reports from the European Commission on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, in the reports from Europol and in a series of statements made by senior representatives of various Member States. With the unprecedented growth in smuggling activity and the informal economy, with the prevalence of corruption and the inability to cope with organised crime, there is no good reason for us to get angry at the fact that our membership is being blocked by additional obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must adopt a position on principle, which is that the rules of the game cannot be changed midway. According to the formal requirements, Bulgaria and Romania are ready for membership of the Schengen area and the European Council must decide in favour of this as soon as possible.

<p class="contents">In February 2011, the Commission registered its 1 000th quality food name. It is clear, however, that the number of applications to register under the protected geographical indication (PGI), protected designation of origin (PDO) and traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG) quality food schemes varies considerably from one Member State to another. Why does the Commission think there are such disparities between Member States? Can the Commission comment on the views expressed by some food producers that the registration process is long and bureaucratic and therefore discourages applicants? How can the registration process be made more user-friendly?</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes? How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The concept of geographical indications was thus familiar and names had already been registered at national level. This explains why there are many registered names in certain Member States. Nevertheless, growing interest in the system has been observed in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure for registering a name generally takes several years. This is because the applicant group has to draw up specifications and have them approved at national level and then by the Commission. The single document summary of the specifications for geographical indications or the specifications themselves for traditional specialties are then published in the Official Journal of the European Union in order to allow objections to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The objection period lasts six months. If there are no objections, the name may be registered. If an objection is lodged, the interested parties have six months to reach agreement. If no agreement is reached, the Commission issues a decision that is voted on by the Standing Committee. This procedure explains the time required for registration to take place. On the other hand, once a name has been registered, it enjoys strong protection and international recognition and benefits from communication tools, particularly use of the logo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the need to speed up the registration procedures. Proposals to this end have been made in the context of the Quality Package, including reducing the time for the Commission to scrutinise applications received to six months and reducing the objection period to two months.</p>
<p class="contents">Awareness of the system varies greatly from country to country, often depending on the number of registered names in a country. The Commission makes funds for promoting quality products available to operators in order to raise consumer awareness of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the labelling of food produce is something that is to be commended. But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration. If ever there was an example of bureaucracy at European level, this surely is it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, it takes the Department of Agriculture five years from the time that you actually make an application until you are registered. Given the crisis in Germany, we need more food labelling, we need more standards; we need more quality control.

Lack of jobs could conceivably generate an exodus of young people from Europe, but the vast majority of young people who change countries to find work will probably choose to move to another Member State. That is why it is so important to promote freedom of movement for workers within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It offers a solution in regions where unemployment among young people is high, given the labour shortages in certain sectors in some Member States that are evident from the Commission’s new quarterly vacancy monitor. Promoting mobility among young people within the EU is one of the aims of the Europe 2020 flagship initiative: Youth on the Move. It outlines a wide range of measures to reduce the current high youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a few examples. Youth labour mobility will be promoted in particular through a new EU job mobility scheme, Your First EURES Job, which was launched with the support of this House and the Council. Its aim is to help young people find a job on the European labour market and assist employers in recruiting young European mobile workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Your First EURES Job will provide advisory, job search, recruitment and financial support amounting, on average, to EUR 1 000 for more than 2 000 young job seekers and companies willing to recruit young EU workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also encourages the Member States to introduce a youth guarantee to ensure that all young people are in further education, training or work within four months of finishing their general education. In Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, as the Honourable Member rightly points out, youth unemployment rates are relatively low. This is due, at least in part, to the comprehensive vocational education and training systems in those Member States, which facilitate young people’s labour market integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bruges Communiqué of December 2010 on enhanced European Cooperation in Vocational Education and Training for the period 2011-2020 is an important European achievement in this area. It outlines objectives and identifies the action needed to improve the quality of vocational training and make it more accessible and relevant to the needs of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also, as another element to my reply, like to highlight the Youth at Work campaign. Launched in Budapest on 29 April, Youth at Work will bring together small and medium-sized enterprises and young job seekers and will provide information and support to inspire young people to set up their own businesses. Over 30 events are planned between now and the end of 2012 when this campaign will end.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I hope that the avenues and initiatives I have indicated will be followed up with effective action within the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the Commission is recommending initiatives to the Member States. I think that in some of the Member States, however, we need some financial assistance in terms of training people and keeping them at home, because I think that, rather than feeding the jobs market within the EU, they will be feeding the job markets of Australia and other countries further afield. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also true that this is more of a horizontal issue for the Commission, and there are in other EU initiatives very relevant proposals including, for example, the country-specific recommendations which we just published today, very important references to the need to reform education policies and improve the performance of education and training systems in various Member States in order to better connect the substance of education and training with the needs of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">This can qualitatively improve the employment opportunities of young people in a number of Member States, including Spain and others where the situation is the most difficult and where the reform of the education system was either delayed or ignored in the recent period.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to highlight the Single Market Act which, among other initiatives, aims at promoting the recognition of qualifications and diplomas, thus making the European labour market more transparent and more efficient, highlighting and raising more opportunities than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to stress that many actions are supported by the financial instruments of the EU, especially in this context, the European Social Fund, but I should also mention the new Microfinance Facility that provides programmes and, in the latter case, entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities, and I think these dimensions have to be reflected in the forthcoming MFF proposal as well.

<p class="contents">Given that the introduction of the Schengen area has shifted responsibility for EU external border controls onto a limited number of Member States, how will the Commission persuade Member States as a whole to show greater and more effective solidarity in the face of a mass influx of migrants and overcome their manifest reluctance to assume their responsibilities in this respect, so as to ensure that the burden is fairly shared? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cecilia Malmström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the question that has been raised by Mr Papanikolaou addresses – as do later questions – the different angles and perspectives of Schengen, the migratory crisis and the pressure put on Schengen. So let me first answer Mr Papanikolaou.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, we discussed Mr Coelho’s report and the need to safeguard Schengen as one of the most beautiful achievements of the European Union. The right to move freely is indeed a very important embodiment of the European project. More than 1.25 billion cross-border journeys are made by tourists within the EU each year. Free movement is also a great boost and a benefit for the Internal Market, so safeguarding this achievement is key to the Commission and an absolute priority for me personally.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise once again that the Commission’s approach is to reinforce Schengen, to improve the evaluation – as we already proposed before Christmas – to clarify the rules, to identify the tools, to assist Member States in need and, possibly, to introduce a mechanism which would bring a coordinated Community-based response to exceptional situations, for instance, when a Member State fails to control its internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s main objective is to have a preventive approach. The proposed changes to strengthen the monitoring mechanism, which is designed to maintain mutual trust between the Member States and their capacity to apply effectively and efficiently the accompanying measures, will make it possible to maintain an area without borders.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be done through more on-the-spot visits to check the application of the Schengen acquis to Member States. These controls could lead to recommendations to the Member States for immediate actions and deadlines for implementing them. Increased trust among Member States will also reduce the recourse by Member States to unilateral initiatives to temporarily reintroduce internal borders or to intensify police checks at internal border zones.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of Schengen is a spirit of trust and solidarity. It is important that the EU show concrete solidarity to the Member States most affected by large-scale inflows of migrants and persons in need of international protection. This solidarity can take different forms by assisting, for instance, where the external border is under pressure. Frontex plays a key role here and we have shown in the recent RABIT intervention at the Greek-Turkish border, and in the joint naval operation Hermes, that Member States are ready to assist other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also foster daily cooperation between national authorities in the field of border surveillance. This is the purpose of the European border surveillance system (EUROSUR), which has been progressively developed since 2008, and for which the Commission will present a legislative proposal during this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also show solidarity by showing financial solidarity. There is a framework programme this year that takes into consideration the management of migration flows. We have a financial mechanism to improve the management of these flows at the European level and to strengthen the solidarity between Member States. Of course, we now have a large consultation process and we are under budgetary restraints, but you can count on me to ensure that there will still be money under this fund for the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States most exposed to migratory pressures and located at the external borders of the EU must receive adequate financial compensation for the tasks they are carrying out in the interests of the Schengen area as a whole – this by fair burden-sharing in order to support those Member States affected by large inflows of persons in need of international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clear that any decision on the relocation of irregular migrants and beneficiaries of international protection depends on the Council and on the willingness of the Member States. The Member States have not yet expressed any support for such an approach on a general basis with, however, one notable exception – the pilot project on relocation to other Member States for persons who have received international protection on Malta. In order to give a timely follow-up to this, I organised a pledging conference a month ago. I am pleased to say that over 300 places were made available from Member States and associated countries. Others will hopefully be offered in the future as well. This is a sign of concrete solidarity. I want to thank those countries and I hope that they can also contribute in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You spoke about trust. Yes, we want to keep building up trust. Does Denmark, in the choice it has made, accept that statement on your part?</p>
<p class="contents">You also commented on the question of the new mechanism. In light of the summit, does this debate on the mechanism strengthen the perception of trust – I recall that, anyway, Article 23 of the Schengen Code makes provision for a mechanism for exceptional situations – or does it perhaps ultimately cause renewed concerns in the Member States and in all the States in the Schengen area? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In answer to the other honourable Member, we are now negotiating the framework, so I am not in a position to give you any figures.

<p class="contents">Of course we need to distinguish between irregular migrants and migrants in need of international protection. As you know, the Council and Parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place, and this is also an area where the European Commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it. In relation to our immediate neighbourhood across the Mediterranean, in the mobility partnerships: we are looking to include all aspects of irregular, legal and international protection asylum under migration.</p>

It is going increasingly mobile, and recent threat analysis suggests that organised crime is getting increasingly involved in criminal activities in cyberspace. So the Commission is pursuing various activities in the field to improve overall cybersecurity and to prevent and to tackle cybercrime.</p>
<p class="contents">At the policy level, specific objectives and road maps have been set in recent policy documents. We have the European digital agenda and the European internal security strategy. In that strategy, cybercrime is clearly identified as one of the priorities for us to work on for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, we also tabled two legislative proposals: one in March, a directive on child online exploitation, was adopted by the Commission and I know it is now being negotiated, and also a proposal for directives on attacks against information cybersystems. That was last September; it is also being negotiated between you and the Council, and I know that a lot of progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">This, of course, strives to adopt European legislation in the face of recent threats in cyberspace. We have, in particular, included provisions to penalise the use of tools such as malicious code that are used to create so-called botnets, which have been used by criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">International cooperation is also key to fighting cybercrime and that is why we are engaging with international partners on these issues. We have the working group between the EU and the United States, created last November, where we have had a series of different expert meetings. We will report on progress for the next EU-US Summit in November this year. We also plan to set up a cybercentre where we could coordinate at European level the efforts that are being made in the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Cybercrime is directly influenced by rapid technological advances, quickly emerging in new business models, but also by the ability of law enforcement and wider society to come to terms with such fluid environments as cyberspace. Cybercrime is becoming a volume crime. It is for this reason that we need jointly to get our systems in order and share intelligence in order to attack this issue. If there is reason to believe that organised crime groups are behind more and more crimes on the Internet, the same investigative measures applied in the detection and prosecution of offline organised crime should be applied, coupled of course with an improved coordination mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ten years ago, the Council of Europe Convention – the Budapest Convention – on Cybercrime was adopted. Ten years later, not all the Member States have signed and ratified that convention. We are pushing, by all means, for ratification by the end of the year, the tenth anniversary, because it would prove an important commitment by all Member States to fighting these crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Schengen evaluations and the possible suspension mechanism</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that Commission proposals for governance of the Schengen zone are seen to be prioritising European procedure over European substance. The Commission is suggesting a dominant lead for itself in a revised Schengen evaluation process, and Parliament proposes to modify that in order to allow a balance between the role of European and national experts. In relation to Schengen suspension, the Commission is proposing an EU mechanism instead of Member State decision, but this has been widely (mis)interpreted to mean that the reintroduction of internal borders will actually be easier in practice. Since it may well prove politically too difficult to implement a Community method for both evaluations and suspension, however worthwhile, would it not be better to make European substance the priority by launching infringement proceedings when necessary against Member States in breach of Schengen rules?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question 12 by Maria Eleni Koppa (<a href="/doceo/document/H-7-2011-000216_EN.html">H-000216/11</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Implementation of the Schengen Agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of movement for European citizens unimpeded by internal borders following the creation of the Schengen area is one of the basic principles of the EU and the cornerstone of European integration. The reintroduction of border controls within the EU does not provide a solution to migration and will, on the contrary, make life more difficult for European citizens and lead to a nationalistic outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this and the statement by the EP President to the effect that freedom of movement is perhaps the aspect of the EU most appreciated by Europeans, what position does the Commission intend to adopt with regard to Denmark following its recent decision to reintroduce border controls? Is it willing to take measures further to strengthen external EU borders? Will it review the principle that the Member State of entry bears sole responsibility for illegal immigrants? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They address the challenge of maintaining and further developing Schengen in view of the migration crisis. I did briefly touch on this in my reply to Mr Papanikolaou’s question, but these elements should, of course, be kept in mind in this context as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In the question, Ms Ludford expressed concerns that the negotiations on the new Schengen evaluation and suspension rules might be lengthy and difficult to agree upon and asked the Commission to prioritise launching infringement procedures against Member States in breach of Schengen rules instead. Let me be very clear on this: infringement of Schengen rules cannot be tolerated, but one element does not exclude the other. We are also planning to follow a parallel approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the guardians of EU law. The Commission will continue to make sure that the Schengen rules are correctly applied and respected by everybody. The basis of our work needs to be the existing legislation. I am convinced that the current legislation can cater for a vast majority of the situations. Where there are any differences in interpretation or implementation, the Commission should consult the Member States in question and clarify the rules. This can be done by issuing guidelines or recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to use all available means to ensure the correct application of EU law, including launching infringement procedures whenever such action is necessary. At the same time, we will work on the preventive measures which should help us to avoid infringement procedures. In this context, we now have ongoing negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council with a view to establishing a more efficient evaluation system for Schengen. We are currently considering whether and how to complement this evaluation mechanism in order to create mutual trust and ensure a coherent application of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Danish Government’s plan regarding controls on the Danish internal borders, which Ms Koppa referred to, you will, of course, be aware that the President of the Commission wrote to the Danish Prime Minister immediately, pointing out that the first analysis by the Commission raised major doubts about whether the proposed measures would be in line with Denmark’s obligations under European and international law. President Barroso emphasised that Member States may not carry out systematic intra-EU border controls of goods or people and urged Denmark to refrain from taking unilateral steps. We are now analysing the information provided by Denmark and will then decide on further action.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Koppa also asked whether the Commission will propose a revision of the principle of exclusive responsibility of the state of first illegal entry. I would like to underline that this is a principle according to which a person found irregularly on the territory of a Member State is returned to the state of first entry into the EU. It is a specific rule under the Dublin Regulation, which establishes that the Member States have to assess which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application lodged on their territory. It is therefore not an instrument designed to respond to the challenges related to irregular migration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission proposal for a recast of the Dublin Regulation, this principle remains untouched. The Member States that play the biggest role in the applicant’s entry into the EU should be responsible for examining his or her application for asylum. The European Parliament expressed overwhelming support for this in its vote on the proposal in May 2009. This support was confirmed by the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in November last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think I have spoken about anything other than Schengen for the last month! I have emphasised how important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it.</p>
<p class="contents">We look very seriously upon all reports of the suspension of Schengen. We are engaged in dialogue with Italy, France and Denmark in order to clarify exactly what has been done, what is being proposed, and whether it is in compliance with Schengen rules. We are also looking at how we can strengthen the evaluation of Schengen in order to make sure, beforehand, that the current peer review system, which is not very good, is exchanged for something that is done at a European level, with an increased role for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have more tools at our disposal to assist Member States. We need to be better at issuing guidelines. We also need to clarify under what exceptional circumstances suspension can be carried out in order to avoid unilateral action that jeopardises the whole system. So you can rest assured that we will do our utmost to strengthen Schengen and that we need more European engagement there, not less.</p>
<p class="contents">Dublin is, of course, related to this, but it is a parallel process. This is part of the negotiations on the asylum package that are currently taking place between Parliament and the Council. The Commission has proposed keeping the responsibility of the first country of asylum in the Dublin Regulation, but also reintroducing an emergency mechanism in order to suspend that mechanism under special circumstances. This is very controversial in the Member States; very few support such an emergency mechanism. It is one of the most difficult areas of the negotiations on the asylum package.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is not the solution to the Greek problem. In parallel with putting the asylum system in place for the whole of Europe, which would also lead to greater burden-sharing – because if all Member States have a system that works, all Member States could receive asylum seekers – the solution for Greece is to continue with the reform plans that are being implemented under the action plan in Greece. The Commission and the Member States are supporting Greece with a huge amount of money, expertise, interpreters and administrators. We are assisting Greece in the important work it is doing to build up a system that is in line with European law. A lot has been done, but there is a lot still to do. This has to be done in parallel with the negotiations on the asylum system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, it differs from the European Social Fund in both its methodology and its objectives. The two instruments cannot therefore be confused, either formally or in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, despite a slow start, changes to the implementing regulation in 2009 enabled the EGF to be used more effectively. Indeed, a clear increase in applications to mobilise this tool that brings the Union closer to its workers has been noted. There is therefore no doubt that it needs to be made sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this specific aspect of the EGF calls for it to be regarded as a permanent fund in its own right, with sufficient payment appropriations to ensure that no transfers have to be made in order to mobilise it.</p>

This year will be crucial for the Fund’s future, because the Commission intends to make a proposal on the rules governing the fund and the way it will function in the next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, the Commission has carried out consultations on this matter with the Fund’s most important stakeholders. In particular, we have closely examined Parliament’s own excellent report on the EGF, which was drawn up by Mr Portas a few months ago. On the basis of experience gained with the Fund in its present form and suggestions made during consultations, we have great hopes that our proposal will significantly improve the fund after 2013 and will, in particular, solve two problems with the current mechanism for financing.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue is the time it takes for a contribution to be granted once a Member State has submitted an application. A large part of that time is taken up by assessing the application. The Commission is looking at ways of clarifying or simplifying the information that the Member States will have to provide to demonstrate that applications are eligible. A lot of time is also taken up with the need to request and obtain approval for each application from both arms of the budgetary authority. This also holds up payment of contributions from the Fund, to the detriment of the workers, because some Member States are reluctant to advance payments for training, job-search assistance and other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the number of applications submitted to the Fund, and thus the overall amount applied for, has increased significantly over the last two years. This has made it increasingly difficult to identify sufficient margins from which to draw contributions. That is a problem. Commission approval of applications to the Fund in 2011 had to be postponed for the first time because sufficient payment appropriations could not be found quickly. I am sure you will agree that this is not helpful to workers who have been made redundant and need assistance quickly. We need to find solutions for these problems and bring the mechanism for financing the Fund more closely into line with these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are several options on the table. For instance, the Fund could be part of the European Social Fund. It could have its own budget. The Commission has taken no decision yet on the best way of addressing these issues, but it intends to table a proposal in autumn on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund of the future, bearing European workers’ best interests in mind. I look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This case is also supported by the fact that, in the near future, fiscal consolidation will remain on the agenda in most of the Member States, and they will find it extremely helpful if there is a strong, quick and effective EU-level instrument to support workers who suddenly find themselves out of a job.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out, some questions remain open, such as the relationship between the EGF and the ESF. As you know, the ESF is implemented through shared management, and I believe that the management system of the current ESF is not compatible with the objectives of the EGF. No matter what eventual format we find, I think this question of management will be very important in influencing the final arrangements. I am not speaking about names, but about the need for a separate fund and the need to pay attention to speed in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, even now, and probably also in the future, various Member States will find it possible to fund programmes either from the EGF or the ESF and have some kind of room for manoeuvre, but it is very important just to keep the EGF available for all Member States in case there is a need to respond to sudden employment crises.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question pointed to the problem of defining eligibility in the current regulation. This is also an issue we are looking at in order to have a greater level of clarity, but at the moment, we are simply working on extending the temporary regulation until the end of this financial perspective. I am speaking here about the rules which have been introduced in response to the crisis and to make the EGF more effective in tackling the impact of the crisis on workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Collective labour agreements</span></p>
<p class="contents">Having had recourse to the bailout mechanism, Greece, Spain and Portugal have come under heavy pressure from the Commission and the IMF to make major changes to industrial relations and collective bargaining procedures under the terms of the respective ‘Memorandums’, thereby overturning national guarantees for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the case of Greece, the Memorandum stipulates the following: ‘The government shall ensure that company-level agreements take precedence over sectoral agreements, which, in turn, take precedence over occupational agreements. The government shall remove the provision that allows the Ministry of Labour to extend all sectoral agreements to those not represented in negotiations’.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, under Article 156 TFEU, matters relating to collective bargaining are governed by the principle of subsidiarity. In view of this: Is the Commission aware that this approach not only is creating a vicious circle of pay cuts and erosion of workers’ rights but also runs counter to the Treaties, which the Commission is required to respect? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some claim that, because these are in the Memorandum, it does not observe the principle of subsidiarity provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. I do not believe that is true. The measures in the Memorandum were drawn up in close cooperation with the Greek Government and endorsed by the Greek Parliament. That shows that they respect the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union backs up my opinion. Article 28 of the Charter stipulates that, in line with EU and national laws and practices, workers or their organisations have the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels, and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action. However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no specific EU legislation regulating which collective agreements take precedence when they are concluded at different levels, nor is there any specific EU legislation regulating the possibility of extending collective agreements concluded at branch level by way of state intervention. These issues therefore fall exclusively within the remit of national law, with due regard for the relevant international obligations of Greece, including the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that I have answered the questions satisfactorily. I also trust that I have convinced you that the fiscal, financial and structural measures in the Memorandum are vital if Greece is to come out of the crisis. I hope I have allayed the fears some of you may have about the failure to observe the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with the free movement of goods, services, and capital, it is a pillar of the Single Market and has contributed to European integration over the last 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has a significant social dimension, insofar as it fosters the social, economic and cultural integration of EU migrant workers and members of their families into the host Member State. The body of EU law on free movement of workers gives EU citizens the right to move freely within the Union for work purposes and protects the social rights of workers and their family members.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, 1 May 2011 was an important date for the EU. It marked the end of restrictions on the right to work of citizens from the eight Member States which joined in 2004, who can now work freely in any Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes that the Member States which still apply transitional measures to workers from Romania and Bulgaria will liberalise their labour markets when the second phase expires on 31 December 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of transitional arrangements means that more EU citizens can take advantage of one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms and work freely in another Member State. That opens great opportunities for the individual, who can move where there are jobs, and also for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that mobility and freedom of movement for workers are also important to this House. The Commission is pleased with the own-initiative report on promoting worker mobility within the European Union and is following the debate in the parliamentary committees with great interest.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are also aware that, despite the large body of EU legislation in the area of freedom of movement for workers, most EU citizens still feel there are too many obstacles to working in another Member State. The situation has been highlighted on several occasions recently. The Monti Report of 9 May 2010 – ‘A New Strategy for the Single Market’ – points out that, while freedom of movement for workers is a success overall from a legal viewpoint, it is the least-used of our four Single Market freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Tackling these problems calls for a broad approach, combined with effective implementation of the principle of free movement. The enforceability of the right of free movement conferred by EU law is particularly relevant in cases of discrimination on the basis of nationality, as the individuals concerned need to have suitable mechanisms to ensure such rights are properly protected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services are currently evaluating EU legislation on the free movement of workers, and in particular Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68, and are exploring the options for improving the enforcement of EU law on freedom of movement, including, where necessary, by presenting an initiative in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report on worker mobility therefore comes at the right time, and will certainly contribute to the debate on enforcement of EU law on free movement of workers and the choice of any further action on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to point out that, for the current funding period, 2007-2013, the resources under the heading of the structural funds have already been allocated and agreed with the regions and the Member States within the framework of the more than 400 operating programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the overall process at the beginning of a funding period is to determine the programmes for the current period and to decide what funding is available for the individual programmes. In accordance with the concept of shared duties or shared management, it is the Member States and/or the regions that are responsible for the implementation of the programmes on the ground. They are also competent and responsible for the selection and implementation of the projects and, ultimately, for monitoring – at least on the initial level.</p>
<p class="contents">Even at the beginning of this period, the subject of energy efficiency and promoting renewable forms of energy was an important point. This is one of the priorities of regional policy, which is also implemented in the form of tailor-made proposals in several of the roughly 400 programmes that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this agreement with the regions and with the Member States, a budget totalling EUR 9.2 billion is envisaged for a sustainable energy policy in the current period, with the key focuses being renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. With a 2009 decision of Parliament and the Council, we also established the possibility that up to 4% of the resources from the European Regional Development Fund could be used for measures to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings. Since then, around half of the Member States have made use of this, with France being particularly exemplary in using and implementing this possibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I also gave you a very specific answer based on the rules that we have in the field of regional policy. The essence of these rules consists of there being agreements in the Member States, and these cannot be unilaterally altered by either the Commission or the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I would want the resources already in place to be used for this, and I would be pleased if that were the case. I find myself going from conference to conference, from Member State to Member State, like a living Tibetan prayer wheel, pleading the case for these resources – which are already in place – to be used. As the expansion of renewable energies does indeed represent one of the focal points of the Europe 2020 strategy, I assume that, in the forthcoming period, there will definitively be a higher budget for this area, including from the regional policy heading. Moreover, there will certainly be investments in this connection, in collaboration with Mr Oettinger, in the field of infrastructure when it comes to trans-European networks in the field of energy provision. If, today, regions are seeking to re-dedicate resources in addition to the resources already available, we are certainly very open, in this area, to the idea of opening up this opportunity or, in any case, to holding serious talks in this regard. Once again, however, we in the Commission cannot unilaterally alter these agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the end of June 2011, the Commission will present its proposal for the next 7-year budgetary framework (2014-2020). In the case of EU regional policy, there have been substantial problems with absorption capacity under the individual programmes. Several programmes have also failed to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to include the absorption capacity of each Member State as a criterion for the allocation of structural fund appropriations in the coming budgetary period?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission agree that payments should be reviewed if a region has been receiving structural funding for years without this resulting in it meeting the targets set?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission consider a ‘sunset mechanism’ that sets a closing date on the allocation of structural fund appropriations to individual recipient regions? Does the Commission agree that such a mechanism would help create a more results-oriented cohesion policy?</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors Annual Report for 2009 found the highest error rate to be in payments under the EU’s cohesion policy. This was the same finding as in previous years. How does the Commission intend to remedy this situation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to absorption capacity and its consideration in the allocation of funds in the forthcoming period, I make reference right now to the existing rule regarding the upper limit on the allocation of funds – in a word, capping. There is a rule that says that, given a certain sliding scale per Member State, only a specific sum measured by the overall GDP of a Member State is available for structural policy. The annual allocation must not exceed this upper limit.</p>
<p class="contents">For the forthcoming period, we will certainly consider whether the level of the current upper limit is justified and whether any adjustments are necessary in order to better design or secure the absorption capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the programmes meeting their targets, I must remind you of the fifth cohesion report and the budget review, in which it was made clear that the performance of the programmes must be given more attention. For the forthcoming period, a set of tests and incentive systems are envisaged in this regard, which the Commission has put forward in the legislative report package for cohesion policy after 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the error rate, I have made reference many times, including in this House, to the methodological problems involved in auditing multiannual programmes. Around half of the EU budget certainly is composed of resources that are allocated for multiannual activities. The auditing by the Court of Auditors in respect of budget implementation always only considers the year in progress, and for that reason, methodological challenges result as, in relation to regional policy, the third audit level applies, while the annual audit by the Court of Auditors already takes place under the first audit level and therefore, a higher error rate will always result here than at the end of a programme cycle, as we can prove already.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, my predecessor, Mrs Hübner, also put in place an action plan together with Parliament in this regard, the efficacy of which is already evident and which has shown its effect. One of these measures, however, was also giving Directorates-General the ability to suspend payments for up to six months in justified cases. By way of example, this tool was used over fifty times last year. All these suspensions of payment were able to be lifted again before their deadlines expired, as the issues about which an objection had been raised had been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the error rate, however, I would also ask you to always take into consideration that regional policy has, if you like, a kind of snowplough function in this connection, that, in relation to certain statutorily developed elements, we check how they are implemented in day-to-day practice, how effective they are and what problems result. The issue of public procurement is repeatedly the subject of discussions with the Member States, regions and final beneficiaries. Around 70% of the error rate occurs in this area. If we succeed in simplifying this system – and we have launched an initiative to this end together with Commissioner Barnier – we will also reduce the practical error rate in this area, too. We are attempting to do our homework in this area and to make progress in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it turned out that they had not been achieved, we would then have the possibility of together examining the causes of non-compliance and whether it was due to domestic or external factors.
