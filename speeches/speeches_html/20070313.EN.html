<p class="contents">I tabled an oral question to the Commission which was supposed to be answered today and I have received a formal answer from the Presidency saying that my question was not acceptable, apparently in application of Annex II(A) of the Rules of Procedure, which says that a question cannot be admissible if it has been answered in the previous three months. But no such question has been answered in the previous three months. Apparently this provision is being applied with regard to a reply given by the Commission to an oral question with debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, Annex II, which is quoted by the Presidency, applies to questions by MEPs regulated by Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure, and the oral question with debate is regulated by Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure. So, since Annex II is a restriction of the rights of a Member of Parliament, an extensive interpretation could not be allowed to apply Annex II to questions in Rule 108 instead of Rule 109. So, I would ask the Presidency to reconsider and to allow the question to be tabled in application of the Rules of Procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us first take a quick look over the context for the next year. In two weeks, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, and the Berlin Declaration will be adopted. The year 2008 should be an opportunity to look forward. We hope that the roadmap to be agreed by the Council in June will create the conditions for achieving a clear and constructive institutional settlement next year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is necessary because Europe needs reform. It would also allow us to send a positive signal before the European elections. Meanwhile, we will see further consolidation of the Union. In 2008, we expect to see a number of Member States joining the Schengen area. We also hope that additional Member States could adopt the euro as soon as they fulfil the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">On the future financing of the European Union, and as agreed by Parliament and the Council, in 2008 the Commission will be working to present a review of the budget. In a few months we will launch a broad consultation to allow citizens, stakeholders and those involved with institutions to express their views on the priorities of the EU and the resources needed to address them.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic objectives defined by this Commission at the beginning of its mandate remain valid: ‘prosperity, solidarity, security and a strong and open Europe in the world’ still summarises the core ambitions of the Commission, and we are happy to see that both Parliament and the Council have backed us.</p>
<p class="contents">In the modern world, a number of highly important issues are not confined to just one or the other of the strategic objectives. They need to be taken forward together across policy areas, and I see three of these as being particularly important for 2008 in the APS.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, energy and climate change. The very positive results of the European Council last week with clear, binding decisions were built on the proposals presented by the Commission in January which brought fresh ideas and policy directions in Europe. Now we must deliver. Whilst we hope to have practical proposals on energy on the table in the third quarter of this year, much work will be needed in 2008. The key elements of the energy package must be put in place. A well-functioning internal market, a vibrant, renewable sector, energy efficiency and solidarity and interconnection will all be taken forward. We will also push for strong commitments by the EU and global stakeholders to reduce CO2 emissions beyond 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol expires.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs remains the main instrument for promoting a more prosperous, environmentally responsible and socially inclusive Europe. We are making good progress in partnership with the Member States. Next year we will reflect on how to press ahead with further reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the single market review and the social reality check which will be presented this year, the Commission will launch a series of initiatives to make sure that the single market continues to deliver on its economic promises and that it allows citizens to reap the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, migration in its various facets is a key challenge for the European Union. Properly managed labour migration can make a positive contribution to our economies and to our societies and we will present two draft directives in this field. We also plan to propose further measures to achieve a common European asylum system by 2010. We will also need further action on preventing illegal migration, combating the ruthless business of human trafficking and protecting our common external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now come back to the strategic objectives and give you a few examples of other key initiatives. As concerns prosperity beyond the continuing consolidation of the internal market, ‘greening’ the transport sector will be a key theme, with action on urban transport, legislation on nitrogen oxide emissions from aviation and on emissions from ships. The Commission will also take preparatory action to ensure the European Institute for Technology is operational as from 2009. In the field of solidarity, the Commission will present a health check of the common agricultural policy, which will pave the way for the future CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on social stocktaking and the mid-term review of the implementation of the social agenda, the Commission will propose initiatives to promote solidarity and access of citizens to rights and opportunities as well as action to tackle discrimination outside the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to propose a new EU action plan on drugs and initiatives to tackle child poverty and protect children using the internet.</p>
<p class="contents">To promote security and freedom, we plan to propose new measures for managing our external borders and to set up a European surveillance system to help Member States to deal with growing flows of illegal immigrants. To support the fight against organised crime and terrorism, we expect to see a centralised data base of fingerprints becoming operational and the Commission will also launch a policy to tackle violent radicalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring internal and external coherence and fighting for a Europe with a strong voice in the world will be another key area for action. We are ready to play a strong role following a status settlement for Kosovo and we will continue the accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey. We will pursue negotiations on new agreements with Russia and Ukraine and develop our ties with key partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards trade policy, alongside continued efforts to deliver the Doha Development Round, action will centre on the Global Europe external competitiveness agenda. The Commission will also work closely with Member States and partner countries to make sure that the European consensus on development makes good progress and strengthens our partnership with the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words on better regulation, which, as you know, informs all the Commission’s work. I am convinced that the Commission and Parliament have a mutual interest in cooperating even more closely than today in this area. Cooperation means agreeing on common priorities and on strategic choices. The Commission’s strategic review on better regulation of November 2006 set out our political priorities in detail, taking into account the views expressed by the European Parliament in its April 2006 part-session, which was devoted to this issue. If need be the Commission will be ready to come back and discuss better regulation in more detail with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also emphasise a novelty in our strategy for 2008. Following the example of the work programme for this year, communication priorities are an integral part of our policy strategy, focusing our messages on a limited number of issues that are of key concern to people, and communicating these clearly reflects and contributes to our overall communication strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to underline the criteria that we applied for ensuring an allocation of staff which matches our policies. Additional resources will be used exclusively to cover needs due to enlargement, whereas all other needs will have to be served through internal redeployment within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The presentation of the annual policy strategy marks the beginning of a process leading to the adoption of the Commission’s legislative and work programme at the end of this year. I feel strongly committed to this process, even though it could still be improved. Together we should make the dialogue between the committees and the Commissioners more political. In the resolution adopted last year, Parliament expressed its intention to involve the political groups more consistently and at an early stage of the procedure. I hope that this will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">A political, frank and constructive dialogue between our two institutions on where Europe should put its political weight and where it should invest its resources in the next year is of major importance, so let us work together for the benefit of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hartmut Nassauer, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>.<span class="italic"> – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is nice that you were able to come after all, Commissioner. We are glad you are here. We have no cause to be over critical, since the presence of Members is in inverse proportion to the importance of this project. This debate makes sense if, when formulating the final legislative programme in the autumn, the Commission listens to what Parliament has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of my fellow Members will be commenting on the details. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats) is in principle prepared not only to give the Commission’s work its political backing in Parliament, but also to go along with the objectives it defined at the beginning of its mandate: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom. I am pleased to confirm that, starting from these objectives, you are also developing the correct political measures for the areas on which we now have to work: growth, employment, climate change, energy, the knowledge-based society, consolidation of enlargement. We can argue about the details.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one criticism of what you say, Commissioner. You announce a common European asylum system for 2010. Forgive my saying so, but the Treaties open the way for minimum standards in these fields, but not for a harmonised European asylum system. Please check very carefully where you are leaving the level of the Treaty here. That is a sore point for me.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative programme is interesting not for what it contains but for what it does not contain. You say in the introduction that these measures meet the citizens’ expectations of where Europe should act. You paint a picture of a Union that is able to respond to the challenges of globalisation. Over all, you draw a comparatively rosy picture of this European Union, especially so far as the citizens’ expectations are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the case, then why did the citizens of France and the Netherlands say such a clear No to Europe? The Treaty itself hardly gave them any reason to, hardly any of them read it. There is a deep unease about the European Union, and if you investigate that unease, you find there is a reason for it — not the only reason, but a reason nevertheless – and that is European bureaucracy. It gives many people the feeling they are having their minds made up for them and having policies forced upon them, being exposed to decisions where nobody understands why they have to be taken in Europe and not in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This feeling of being treated like children provokes rejection, leads to falling turnouts in elections and, if the process continues, it will boost political forces that are really against Europe, and that ought to worry us. We in Parliament, too, must ask ourselves how long we can claim to be the European nations’ legitimate representatives if the election turnout is always less than 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the sources of unease is European legislation. That is why this is the right time to talk about it. You speak yourself, Commissioner, of an ambitious drive towards better regulation. How true and how worthy of support! You have our full political support in that. So far, however, you have only mentioned the target: a 25% reduction. You do not say how that target will be achieved. Better regulation is more than anything something which is meticulous about respecting the limits of subsidiarity and respecting the competence of the Member States rather than craftily pushing those limits back.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has in its hands a key to regaining the public’s confidence. We also need a new culture of subsidiarity. Every piece of draft legislation should take care not to regulate every detail, but to weigh up carefully where the Member States’ regulative competence begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Point the way, Commissioner! Less central lawmaking will be Europe’s gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam Vice-President, our group believes the Commission has done a number of good deeds. We nevertheless hope that in its remaining time in office the Commission, together with the European Parliament, will be an even stronger driving force for the European Union’s development. We will fully support it when the Council hesitates and procrastinates and does not really want to take Europe forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin with a positive example, energy policy, and in this connection of course climate policy, a subject that is very close to your heart. It was absolutely right to insist that there must be binding targets, especially for renewable energies. It was equally correct to look for a pragmatic solution in the matter of competitiveness. So far as nuclear technology is concerned, it was absolutely right to accept that there are different approaches. There is one thing I would like from the Commission here, however, something that may perhaps reconcile the different approaches, namely a high standard of safety and also corresponding obligations on nuclear power plants and the countries that use nuclear technology to provide information. I would like the Commission to come forward with proposals on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In energy foreign policy, too, it is important to press on further, on the one hand saying we want to diversify and on the other supporting diversification. It is also extremely important to nominate the Commission coordinators who will ensure that we forge a variety of links for energy supplies. If the Polish Government believes it needs to develop an energy policy together with Ukraine and some countries of the southern Caucasus, then I hope the Commission will get on with developing an all-European energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, also on energy foreign policy: I know that the Commission is making preparations for cooperation with the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. There, too, it is important that the Commission is not hampered by the Council in its proposals – for cooperation in energy, for migration policy and especially not for visa policy. I was very sorry that the Commission did not object when the Member States originally went so far as to tighten visa policy for our neighbours by demanding higher fees. I hope it will be successful in negotiating a sensible visa policy with all our neighbours, especially of course the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to come to the matter that lies close to our hearts: social competence. Mr Nassauer is not wrong in saying why many people in Europe are sceptical about the European Union, the Commission and even the European Parliament. It is also because the social dimension is underexposed in the Commission’s work. You admit it yourself: in the most recent documents you have published, whether about the internal market for the citizens or social reality stocktaking in Europe, you write quite clearly why this scepticism and this detachment have come about, saying that there is no point in the internal market unless the ecological and social consequences are seen and these aspects are also strengthened. But when I look at the actual proposals, they contain too little of this social component. When I look at two studies recently published in Europe, one about women’s pay on the labour market and the other about poverty, then it is a sign of our inadequacy that we have poverty again in Europe and that the differences between men’s and women’s pay are still so great.</p>
<p class="contents">The social task has not therefore been completed, and so if we are for the internal market, the social component must also be included. If the left and the right have recently had election results that in fact stem from social ills and the feeling that the social aspect is being overlooked, that we are again pursuing a narrow-minded national economic policy and we believe that is the way to deal with globalisation, it is also because we have not sent the citizens enough signals saying ‘yes to the internal market’ and ‘yes to social Europe’. That is very important for us and we would like the Commission to do more here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That comes out in the very first sentence of your work programme, where you say that the policy areas in which the Commission is to be active will meet with broad agreement. We welcome that. We welcome this self-confidence and we also welcome the fact that the Commission has found a clear course. We still want stronger leadership, however. And to stay with the image of a course, we would like you to sail more strongly with the wind, so that you will go faster.</p>
<p class="contents">That was early praise, so to speak, but in essence we are saying that this is a good programme; in our opinion, however, it is not enough for the situation in which Europe now finds itself. What we are missing above all is a clear word about Europe’s future. In the 24 page working paper you devote all of three lines to Europe’s future, but the question of where we are heading, what our common ‘progress’ should look like, is not answered, and this strategy for a work programme does not even attempt an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">That we are all working together for Europe is not taken for granted as much as this paper suggests. As Mr Nassauer has already said, it is unfortunately not accepted by the public as much as we would like. That is why it is important that the Commission sets the direction here. We want the Commission to spearhead the movement, demanding clear instructions as to where the European future is actually to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Your strategy is to supply results. We think that is good. Results are fine for showing the areas in which we are in fact visibly active. Only again and again we have the problem that national politicians, mostly from governments, take the credit for successes, while Europe has to take the blame for failures or unpleasant consequences. The Council’s good results are the most recent example. In Germany, at least, these good results are being credited to Mrs Merkel and the groundwork done by the Commission and European Parliament is not noticed at all. To that extent, the strategy of delivering results is a very ambivalent strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, for all the welcome initiatives you present there are some that make us wonder what the grounds are for your satisfaction. You speak, for example, of a renewed consensus on enlargement. We cannot see that. You also want a common central database for fingerprints. There is no consensus for that either. It surprises us, especially in the light of the fact that, at the start of his term of office, Commission President Barroso styled himself a champion of civil rights. Such a database is the opposite of what he announced at the start of his term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues will speak further about the various areas of policy. I would just like to mention one fundamental structural point that we have always raised in past debates. For the sake of being closer to the citizens and of making this document easier to handle, we would like you to say precisely what are legislative initiatives, what has nothing to do with legislation, what are new initiatives and what are follow-up measures, so that we really know what concrete steps we can expect in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we would like the citizens to be involved. The Commission is keen on communication. We believe that is right. The more interactive that can be, the better. If, for greater visibility for the policy of results, we can have these debates on strategy not only in the European Parliament, but also in the national parliaments, that would be an important step towards making clear where which policy comes from in the common Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe there has seldom been so much attention paid to the particular role and task of Europe as in the last few weeks, when everything has focused on the big question of climate protection policy and energy policy, that is on the biggest environmental policy issue of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased with the outcome of the summit, because even though there is still a lot to negotiate in the small print the summit still achieved what the public expected after being made aware of the issues by Al Gore or the Stern report.</p>
<p class="contents">What the summit achieved was to give the public the impression that we are initiating a paradigm change, that we are bringing renewable energies out of a niche and that we will in future be backing energy efficiency in quite a different way than before. The key thing now is that we should also live up to the expectations we have awakened in Europe. If I may say so, Commissioner, I am not yet so sure that we will, because Mrs Merkel had scarcely announced this summit decision and declared the successes when it started all over again in the nation states and to some extent in the Commission, too. Everything was called into question again. As always, Mr Verheugen came out against the progressive trio of Commissioner Piebalgs, Commissioner Dimas and Commissioner Kroes. And I am not so sure whether Commissioner Barrot will be able to implement the results of the summit properly, neither – I am saying this expressly here – do I have any confidence in Commission President Barroso and the energy policy revolution he proclaims.</p>
<p class="contents">You really are the right person, Commissioner, to try and see that, for example, the debate about the European constitution gets a better future by ensuring that the great expectations that we European politicians have awakened these last few months are not disappointed again. The negotiations on the small print of the summit declaration are only just starting, and I can see some powerful, influential men on the European stage, including Mr Verheugen and Mr Barroso, who despite Chirac’s departure in France are building a kind of old boys network standing in the way of the sustainability of these summit decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why should that be? For one thing, it is rather like a store catalogue and the priorities are not established clearly enough. For another, there are many points that are highlighted as ‘key actions’ but they are very vague and say very little.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention a few examples: the initiative aimed at reconciling family and professional life, legislative initiatives to strengthen consumer protection, further initiatives to implement the EU Maritime Policy — we find one initiative after another, but in what specific way consumer protection is to be strengthened, what you intend to propose in that area, does not appear. All too often there is nothing precise.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the social situation in the European Union, you announce – as it says here – a social reality stocktaking, and at the same time you announce visionary initiatives to promote solidarity and access of citizens to rights and opportunities. I have to say I was quite amazed to read that here. Do you really believe you can convince the public about the European Union and especially about Europe’s possibilities, and allay people’s fears for the future, when in this paper you as good as admit that you know nothing of the social reality in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members Mr Nassauer and Mr Swoboda have already raised this question. I do not believe you will win the public over again like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a word on the subject of cutting red tape and better regulation, which is said to be at the heart of the Commission’s daily work. Better regulation does not start simply by presenting a much more detailed strategy; it is important and essential to assess its impact, and it will in fact be interesting to debate the results of the external evaluation of the impact assessment system. I would like to stress, however, that better regulation must not necessarily mean deregulation or boil down to minimal regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam Vice-President, I would like to ask what is happening about the announced withdrawals of legislative proposals. In my report, Parliament asked that the Commission’s annual legislative and work programme should show precisely which legislative proposals the Commission is thinking of withdrawing. Could you say briefly what is planned for the way ahead until 2008? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite serious doubts about the extent to which CO2 causes global warming, the EU is determined to lead the world in reducing emissions. But, apart from nuclear power, sources of energy other than fossil fuels are still far from viable. This is true of renewables in particular. We now have a binding target of 20% for renewable energy with no proper assessment of the methods of achieving this ambitious goal or its cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to mention a lesson from the kindergarten school of economics. If you raise the cost of a resource, you make goods more expensive and you reduce competitiveness. We are told that this initiative will stimulate innovation in renewable technology and improve exports. Instead, it will make us all poorer.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest this sudden obsession with carbon emissions is a distraction, an attempt to take our minds off all those other projects that have had disappointing results, such as the Lisbon Strategy, immigration and asylum policy, reform of the common agricultural policy, the euro and several more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few weeks ago, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission – and even though a President of the Commission may be a high official, he is, in the final analysis, only a purely politically elected official – told the Dutch people in their own country that they should now move on and accept this European Constitution, which, despite the rejection and democratic referendum in two Member States and despite the fact that quite a few other Member States do not even dare organise a referendum on this topic, is gradually being implemented anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not entirely dissimilar from the accession negotiations with Turkey, which have no democratic basis whatsoever and which were also decided on by European institutions that are far removed from the citizens, by excessively privileged officials and Heads of Government who very deliberately refuse to ask the public its opinion even on an issue as fundamental as this one.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is no different. In its policy strategy for 2008, the Commission has announced measures that should bring about a fresh immigration wave to Europe, even while its citizens are demanding the exact opposite. They are finally asking us for effective measures to limit, or ideally put a stop altogether to, the immigration from non-European countries by adequately protecting our borders and by phasing out the semi-legal immigration channels, such as that of family reunification, which is far too lenient.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission proposal, the impression is given that this is a temporary phenomenon and that non-European temporary workers are expected to return to their countries of origin in a relatively short period of time. This is deception. Reality has taught us that these temporary workers do not return home, that their relatives join them sooner rather than later, and that subsequently, no measures of any kind will force these people out of the country. As a result, the Community is once again lumbered with the consequences of this short-sightedness, the clash of cultures, the forming of ghettos, crime as a result of people being uprooted and eventually, the breakdown of a whole community.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, then, that a fresh immigration wave is absolutely pernicious. Instead, we should start by protecting our European borders, develop a European policy for returning illegal immigrants and aliens who have become involved in criminal activity, and should demand that those non-Europeans who are on European soil legally should become thoroughly integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">In Brussels, Europe’s capital, 40% of the residents of non-European origin, including third-generation, are currently unemployed. So do not try to tell me that we should import even more unemployment. Finally, I come to the essential thing, which is that the European project is once again being met with much distrust among the European citizens. Europe will not generate renewed enthusiasm until such time as it becomes truly democratic and listens to the wishes and needs of its peoples and citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly: energy. The European Council has made a significant contribution in this area, and I hope that the Commission will succeed in converting these directives into practical and effective proposals. This commitment affects us all, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the EU, which asks the Member States to make great efforts to reach the targets, should set a good example: with a single action – rationalising the Strasbourg seat – it would achieve not only a significant reduction in waste in terms of energy, paper, heating, lighting and moving thousands of people in cars, trains and aeroplanes every month, it would also send out a strong political message that would undoubtedly have a positive impact on our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Lisbon. The lifelong learning programmes launched this year are certainly valid instruments; however, there is a need to strengthen the measures to close the gap between education and entry into the world of work, particularly for young people and researchers who are otherwise forced to leave our borders. It is also important to encourage mobility among young people, including with regard to informal learning, to stimulate family policies in order to meet the demographic challenge, and to improve access for small and medium-sized enterprises to credit, including through microcredit programmes, and to EU funding, particularly with regard to research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: multilingualism. I hope that the Commission will honour the commitments made in its communication in November 2005 with regard to, and I quote, ‘promoting multilingualism in European society, in the economy and in the Commission itself’. It is unacceptable that documents intended for all EU citizens, such as websites and, in particular, information documents relating to European programmes, apart from notices, should be available in two or three languages only, effectively restricting access for many small communities to European Union funding. A perfect example of this is that the documents for accessing the LINGUA programme for the promotion of multilingualism are in English, French and German. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, the last document that Parliament had in relation to budgetary priorities was presented in December last year. I am talking about the resolutions that accompanied the current budget, the 2007 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question would be whether you believe that those resolutions, which we approved by an overwhelming majority in this House and which you received very warmly, have been incorporated into the annual political strategy document.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to us that they have not been incorporated and that is a problem, Commissioner, because we always find ourselves in the same situation: Parliament draws up a series of guidelines that should be taken into account in the next budgetary procedure, you lay out your political priorities in this annual political strategy document, you add a budgetary component, but you do not take any notice, or at least you do not take sufficient notice, of everything Parliament asked for the year before.</p>
<p class="contents">That happens year after year. We have yet to find a perfect balance between the budgetary procedures and the European Commission’s legislative programme and therefore our two institutions often work in parallel, but we have not yet managed to bring our systems into line.</p>
<p class="contents">You are playing a game with the timetable. You draw up political priorities but, as the rapporteur for this year’s budget, Mr Virrankoski, has said, Parliament has not so far had any indication of what the European Commission’s political priorities for this year will be, and that means that, when it comes to drawing up the budget, we will find yet again that this Parliament’s budgetary priorities do not coincide with the political priorities laid out by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We find this, for example, within the framework of the financial implications. You intend to fund these political priorities by means of certain headings that are increasing and other headings that are being reduced; you are asking us for 890 new posts in the Commission, although you hope to create most of them by means of internal readjustments; furthermore, you expect to make adjustments in the executive agencies. Commissioner, like every year, we feel a degree of confusion and during this year’s budgetary procedure we hope that we will be able to reach agreements that do not involve great budgetary tensions with the Council, nor, in particular, with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too thought that the result of the summit was satisfactory. I also think that the concentration on growth and employment is to be welcomed. Allow me to remind you of the major review of the economic and employment guidelines due next year. This is important, and Parliament has emphasised on numerous occasions how important it is for Parliament to be properly consulted on this occasion and to have plenty of time to submit its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the topic discussed by Mr Swoboda, among others. I believe it was Jacques Delors who once said that no one loves the internal market. That is why it needs to be supplemented and balanced out by a proper social dimension. The Commission talks a very great deal about the social dimension, but delivers extremely little. There are few new proposals in the social area.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me nonetheless to mention what is positive. It is positive that the Commission is now addressing the issue of discrimination outside the labour market too, for example against disabled people and other groups. It is positive that social services are being discussed and that an attempt is being made to clarify what is distinctive about them. We had a debate about this yesterday in response to a report, and I personally hope that clarification will be in the form of a sector-specific directive. Otherwise, what we have are surveys of the social situation and of the way in which labour law operates. There are all kinds of surveys, but few practical proposals. Allow me to mention two proposals concerning areas in which I think fairly practical initiatives could be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Restructuring is taking place all around Europe. Old jobs are disappearing, and new ones being created. The information and consultancy instruments we have, for example the European Works Council and the Directive on Informing and Consulting Employees, do not work properly. Employees lose their jobs without having been properly informed of the process under way and without having been involved in that process. It is time that the Commission took the initiative and reviewed the existing directives to ensure that they operate as intended.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is that of the working environment. With the 50 or so directives that exist, Europe has made huge progress over the years in terms of the working environment. There are now very few deaths and injuries in the workplace. At the same time, new problems connected with the working environment are arising out in the labour market because of the way in which the latter has changed. These include stress, burn-out and harassment. In these areas, Commission initiatives are conspicuous by their absence. My advice to the Commission is not just to talk about the social dimension but to deliver, for example when it comes to information, consultation and issues concerning the working environment. <span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the amounts of money available are not in harmony with these ambitions. What is even worse, the distribution of the limited resources does not follow or reflect our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect that the 2008 budget will support the process of enlargement and the successful preparation of candidate countries and potential candidate countries more effectively than did those of the past. The accession negotiations that have already begun must be continued, and done on the basis of their own merits. We consider it a welcome development that the document considers it a priority to find a solution for Kosovo. The time has come to take decisive steps in creating equilibrium between the eastern and southern dimensions of our neighbourhood policy. From this perspective, it is a good sign that the strategy contains several new initiatives with regard to the southern, eastern and Caucasian countries as well. We recognise that this is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is desirable that the promotion of democracy and human rights should be the guiding principle of the European Union’s policy of support, which should be implemented not only in words but also systematically in practice. Unfortunately, this has not yet happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Much is said in the document about the importance of energy policy, and with this we are unreservedly in agreement. However, we regret that the substantive and institutional requirements of the foreign policy component of energy policy are not in the document. We must absolutely devote attention to this matter, since this is one of the major challenges of this new era. We have little money, and so we must use what we have in an effective and visible manner that focuses on priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You can happily write anything you like on it, but implementing what is written can be much more difficult. Essentially, that is how I would describe the latest Commission statements. They are noble declarations, but they sometimes create virtual reality.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the very introduction to the document on the Union’s Annual Political Strategy 2008 there is mention of the initiative to create a European Institute for Technology. A couple of pages further on, however, it is stated that the aforementioned institute will indeed be created, but only in 2009 at the earliest. I have actually read carefully through as many as several dozen priority Commission actions for the coming year. We need to be sensible. If everything is prioritised, the term priority loses its meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of external policy, there is reference to progress made by the Western Balkans towards future membership of the Union. In fact, the accession of those Balkan countries depends on institutional reform of the Union, which means the countries concerned have become pawns in our own disputes within the Union. This is a further instance of the gap between the statements made and reality. I agree with the previous speaker who stated that the issue of the South Caucasus countries and their progress towards possible future membership of the European Union should be given greater prominence in this document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet a look at these work programmes, including the one for 2008, just leaves us with long faces. For 2008, too, we find the habitual proclamation of better regulation, but programmes stand or fall on their implementation rather than their proclamation.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of budgetary control, 2008 will be another disappointing year. We note the lack of management measures and proposed approaches to implementing the promise Commissioner Kallas made in 2005 to obtain an unqualified Statement of Assurance on the EU budget from the European Court of Auditors by 2009. I should like to remind the House of the 44% error rate for the Structural Funds that has been detected once again for the 2005 budget. After all, the Commission President has confirmed this promise: we would have expected the Commission to remember its promise and take the necessary steps in its own field of direct management, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">2008 is the last year in which the Commission will be able to change anything. Incidentally, it is the first year in which the recipients of EU subsidies have to be disclosed. We would have logically expected to see a mention of this milestone of EU support policy, too. Perhaps the silence means this disclosure is not taking place? After all, up to now, there has not been a single document – even a single line – about how the Member States and the individual EU funds are to implement the publication requirement. Nor have there been any suggestions whatsoever as to what is to be done with this information. We need, or rather the Commission needs, to think about the way this information is to be used and the consequences of this information for the individual policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is that, in our view, the 2008 work programme is a disappointing document in which the Commission falls far short of its own proclamations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is consistent with our priorities, which are the Lisbon Strategy, the fight against climate change and its effects, judicial cooperation and so on, but it overlooks the importance of the social dimension and of social cohesion in the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Your priorities are needed to enable the Union to rise to the challenges of globalisation. Nevertheless, I question the fact that neither the financial perspective nor the programmes as they have been codecided leave us with much room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">To be more precise, with regard to competitiveness, growth and employment, if the margin is left unchanged – at EUR 70 million – if new priorities are announced regarding Frontex and Eurojust and if three new transport agencies are created, then certain policies are liable to suffer: I am thinking of the seventh FRDP, which could have difficulties in getting off the ground; I am thinking of the trans-European transport network, funding for which is absolutely crucial; I am thinking of all those social policies that are not yet sufficiently developed; and I am thinking of the CIP, which is a vital tool of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought not to reduce the commitments of these already badly-managed policies. It is not only European growth that is at stake here, but also our objectives regarding competitiveness, employment and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the freedom, security and justice policies, the margin of EUR 32 million is very small. Increasing the funding for policies arising out of Frontex and Eurojust will inevitably reduce the resources originally allocated to other vital programmes, such as the integration of third-country nationals and such as a truly ambitious policy aimed at refugees, the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is implying that these programmes are not yet up to speed. Why, though, were they not implemented quicker?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agricultural issues, I join my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in expressing serious doubts about the proposal for a single CMO covering all agricultural sectors. This could result in a lack of consideration being given to the specific characteristics of some agricultural produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the scope of the ‘health check’ exercise is not yet known or detailed in the Commission proposals, I would ask you to provide some clarification on this matter. The recent statements made by the Commissioner for Agriculture contradict what you wrote.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Union’s actions, we are anxious to see all of the declared priorities upheld. We cannot accept our priorities regarding health, education and promotion being neglected in favour of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am surprised at how brief were the allusions made to the revision exercise scheduled to begin in 2008. This leads me to address the Commission directly: is the revision of the financial perspective a taboo subject?</p>
<p class="contents">I have already expressed my curiosity to know the estimated additional cost of the better regulation initiative. Could you provide us with the estimates for which we have been waiting for so long?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to see the spotlight put on communication this year. It is mentioned in this text, but the Commission’s actions need to be refocused on this matter. The Europe of democracy is at a standstill, the citizens are turning their backs on it and our texts are more and more ambitious. We are far from achieving our dreams. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Outside of the issues in relation to climate change which I have just mentioned, three other key areas that the Commission must face and deal with in the coming year are the issues of ensuring the delivery of the Lisbon Agenda and, in particular, investment in research and development – 3% of GDP – looking at areas of innovation and encouraging the new technologies, which will become the major employment opportunities for Europe in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of reconnecting with our young people within Europe. For too long, we have spoken about the wonderful wealth and resource that is our young population within Europe. However, outside of the Erasmus programme and one or two other, smaller, educational programmes, the actual original idea of Youth for Europe action plans seems to have been forgotten and put to one side. And, as I said, this is a huge resource, not just in economic terms but in development terms – in ensuring we can deliver a proper and wonderful future Europe to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the common foreign and security policy is a key element, one where Europe must be seen to deliver on the world stage, and yet there seem to be difficulties with regard to the budget and forward planning with regard to what can be done there.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Commissioner, I know you have much on your plate at the moment and there are other difficulties interinstitutionally, but unless we are seen to act on behalf of our citizens and deliver to our citizens, then all of the bureaucracy is not going to help.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that we should cut red tape and make it easier for businesses to operate. Better regulation and less regulation could be a way forward to achieving some of those goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This morning I want to welcome the early start that you are giving us on the development of the policy strategy. I agree with you that this is important in stepping up our political dialogue. I think you said that you were looking for frank and productive dialogue, so I hope that you will accept my remarks in that spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, one of the major concerns I have with this document, as with the previous ones – and I hope that discussing this now may prompt you to do something about it – is that I want to see the focus and resources underlying your work devoted also to consolidating and implementing the existing legislation. Policy strategy is not just about new initiatives. We want you to have the maturity to tell us about what you are doing to implement the existing rules and regulations. In my particular area of interest, the single market, you rightly talk about allowing citizens and SMEs in particular to benefit from that market. I suggest to you that in 2008 by far the single most important thing you can do is to make sure that the Single Market for Services Directive is properly implemented in all Member States. That would be more important than any other initiative you may want to take. I want to see it in your strategy when the proposal comes out.</p>
<p class="contents">And just two other things: I am surprised that there appear to be no policy initiatives at all in the area of the knowledge society and information technology, despite the fact that there is a large and important work programme in progress. So maybe you should look at that. I do not think that initiatives have dried up in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of better regulation raised by a number of my colleagues, it is no use whatsoever for the Commission to continue these excellent initiatives, if nobody knows about them. Why is that not on your list of communications? Because our citizens need to know what is going on and need to be engaged with the process if we are to assess its impact. So please put that as one of your communication priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what they miss in these proposals. I should like to take this one step further and say that Europe should be more social not only within Europe, but also outside it. It is when Europe is a world partner that it becomes obvious how much the aspect of development and the relationship with development cooperation are lacking from a number of topics in the work programme for 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, in this respect, mention the areas of agriculture, the review of the European framework legislation for pharmaceutical companies and maritime policy. This year’s general objective in the European consensus on development is once again to reduce poverty in Africa and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but the fact is that, as regards the Millennium Development Goals for Africa, things are heading the wrong way.</p>
<p class="contents">Where does the Commission intend to go from here? In the tenth European Development Fund, which is currently being prepared and which accounts for half of all the development funds, only 2% is being set aside for education and 2.5% for health care. This is, of course, in stark contrast with what this working programme is hoping to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, today, Commissioner Mandelson and others are discussing economic partnership agreements with ministers from developing countries and the Union’s ministers for development cooperation, a wide-ranging issue indeed. In actual fact, our counterparts from developing countries have the feeling that we are prizing open their markets rather than placing their development at the heart of our policy. Another inconsistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to agricultural policy, I should like to give you an example from the fishing industry. For the Seychelles, fish, and mainly swordfish, is an essential product to be brought to our markets. We, however, reciprocate by imposing a non-tariff trade barrier in the form of the requirement of very low cadmium levels. While we allow much higher cadmium levels in our chickens and pigs, we ban swordfish from the Seychelles with low cadmium levels. This inconsistency in many areas of policy must be addressed in this programme for 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I like that phrase but I have to conclude unfortunately that, in the area of fundamental rights, the European Commission is falling short of its promises.</p>
<p class="contents">I remind you once again that, in 2004, Mr Barroso got the green light for his Commission only after a solemn pledge to become the champion of fundamental rights. Unfortunately that is not reflected in this document and it is not reflected in the actions of the Commission over the last two-and-a-half years. In this area, the Commission is timid and reluctant. You should not only defend, but also promote fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things in this document which strike me. First, there is an imbalance between your proposals to fight terrorism and your proposals to defend privacy and civil liberties. There is a distinct imbalance there. We urgently need data protection in the third pillar and I wish the Commission would push harder for that. Even if there is no consensus within the Council, then it is still for the Commission to show political leadership. Do not wait for the Council! Let the Council explain why it cannot agree on data protection in the third pillar. You should make it very clear where you stand.</p>
<p class="contents">That also goes for the ‘horizontal directive’ that this Parliament has called for repeatedly, banning discrimination on all grounds, everywhere and not only in the workplace. We therefore welcome the initiative to combat discrimination outside the labour market. However, I think that, in reality, what we are talking about here is only a consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, show more courage! Show more sincere and personal commitment to pushing anti-discrimination legislation. Show more leadership, and do not wait for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a very practical proposal, which you do not even have to include in your strategic programme. In the context of 2007, the year of equal opportunities, I would like to ask Commissioner Barroso to do a personal chat session with European citizens on the issue of discrimination and fundamental rights. I would like the Commissioner to say whether she will pass on this request, or proposal, to Mr Barroso and see if he is willing to comply, because that would show his personal commitment to fundamental rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are many challenges before us. We need to rise to tackle them in a way that will bring about greater cohesion between Member States and increase the citizens’ trust in the Union. Last year, in the context of our relations with Russia, the Union showed that it is capable of demonstrating solidarity with its Member States. This political trend should be fostered.</p>
<p class="contents">If we promote high standards of environmental protection we shall gain respect and strengthen our position on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the latest enlargements and the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, it appears that we should devote more effort to cementing the Union than to further enlargement. The accession of Croatia seems to be the only priority in that regard at present.</p>

After all, Europe – particularly the Commission, of course – is judged on the extent to which it backs up its words with action. Take bureaucracy reduction, for example – the Commission’s flagship. Looking back over recent weeks, I note that the Commission has presented a new strategy on health at work for the next five years, with particular regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, which identifies SMEs as the scene of most incidents. These will undoubtedly have to reckon with requirements to match in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Take consumer protection: there is now a Green Paper on this that makes the relevant stipulations. I think it is good that the Commission is giving thought to where unnecessary bureaucracy can be eliminated. Commissioner, the best kind of bureaucracy reduction starts with the absence of bureaucracy creation. The Commission has simply failed in this regard in recent years, in that it has continuously presented new legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and the Commission’s stubbornness in ignoring Parliament’s words is astonishing – we are stipulating all the records insurance intermediaries will have to keep in future when negotiating with consumers about the relevant products. In terms of the suggestion that we examine the issue of hedge funds without calling for regulation – the risks concerned have been regularly mentioned by Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank in this House and by the central banks around the world – there is no mention of this in the Commission’s plan for 2008. The Commissioner’s colleague Mr McCreevy is not doing anything in the areas that present real risks – which smacks of neglect of duty. We are not calling for regulation, but simply for an analysis of the status quo. The strategy paper says nothing about this; nothing is being done in this field – which is indeed astonishing. This is strongly reminiscent of clientele politics for the benefit of certain regions of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the Strategy and the Commission’s work cannot be divorced from the needs and expectations of the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I wish to refer to one of the Commission’s priorities that the Commissioner emphasised strongly in her presentation, namely solidarity. I do not wish to speak about economic solidarity, but instead about social solidarity. I welcome the Commission’s statements that take account of such solidarity. These include the equal opportunities policy, the prevention of discrimination outside the labour market and combating all its manifestations, reconciling family and working life, and also eliminating youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is in the plan for the current year 2007, which has been designated the European Year of Equal Opportunities. I understand that this must be taken forward. I am especially interested, however, in the Commission’s statements and actions aimed at supporting and protecting fundamental rights, with particular reference to the rights of children, including a forum on the rights of children. I am glad the Commission wishes to protect children using the Internet and other new media, but above all else I welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to combat child poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to ensure that every child enjoys a decent standard of living. In this connection, I should like to ask the Commissioner about the state of progress on existing projects prepared by the Commission. There are some Parliament ones too. In particular, I have in mind the regulation on implementation of maintenance payments, for which I am the rapporteur. This aims to ensure that maintenance payments can be obtained swiftly and directly when those responsible are working in other Member States and have defaulted on their payments, thus condemning their children to a life of poverty because they are deprived of an appropriate standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am asking if the Commission does want to see progress on this issue, because thousands of European children are longing for this regulation. They need our help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication is rather incoherent. It is divided into four parts: prosperity, solidarity, security and freedom, and Europe as a strong international player. This structure is poorly suited to administrative structure and multi-annual financial frameworks. The goal of activity-based budgeting and administration is to make administration transparent and clear, which is what a communication of this type fails to promote. It is hard for the reader to follow what the Commission intends to do in the current sectors. It is difficult to see how both human and financial resources are to be channelled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appears to have faith in administration. It is going to create another two separate agencies in addition to the previous ones and the European Institute of Technology besides. In my opinion, more bureaucracy should be viewed extremely warily. No new administrative bodies can be set up unless they are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">One surprise is that the Commission is to establish two new policy programmes under Heading 4, which would relate to climate change and energy efficiency. The costs of these next year would be in excess of EUR 20 million. It is astounding that, just two months after the new financial perspectives began, new expenditure is being proposed for them. In terms of budget policy, it is regrettable that the Commission intends to find the money for the new expenditure by postponing the financing of existing programmes. Parliament should make a careful appraisal of this move, which could lead to its own priorities being undervalued.</p>
<p class="contents">With all this in mind, we can look forward with interest to concrete legislative and budgetary proposals by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, on climate change, of course, if we do not keep below that 2o target, we know the devastation that will result in terms of flooding and drought and population movement and so on. The other day I went up the Thames with the Environment Agency, saw the need for a new barrage at the estuary of that river, saw the flood plains which are going to be affected by flooding, and saw the building that is going on on the flood plains without taking account of the need to put people higher on those flood plains if they are going to live there.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not designing yet. We are not preventing yet and that must be our agenda in 2008 and beyond. We need a policy of prevention. We also need a policy of managing existing threats. We need a combination of law and individual effort. Hence, we need the 20% reduction targeting greenhouse gasses by 2020. Hence, we need the 20% target for renewables. Hence, we need the biofuels targets, particularly with the second generation. But, hence, we also need the eco-labelling revision to help consumers understand the options, and we need action on light bulbs and stand-by switches and so forth. Hence, we need effective implementation and monitoring by the Commission and particularly, may I say, of emissions trading and the national action plans. And I ask the Commission to be tough on Member States on these.</p>

<p class="contents">The truth is that 2008 is going to be a key year in terms of moving forward the debate on the new budget for the European Union, which should accompany the constitutional advances that we trust will be consolidated during this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a European budget that is a match for our ambitions and the demands of the European citizens in particular. The current situation appears to be clear and favourable. Ecofin has just said that we are in a solid economic situation, to the extent that the economic indicators are clear, and the extremely weak situation of the part of European GDP made up of wages and employment is therefore notable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Juncker has said this and all of the ministers have agreed. It is therefore now time to talk about the distribution of the fruits of that growth and this is not just a concern of the governments and social partners. It is a demand from the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been clearly stated that the current situation is unsustainable and furthermore carries with it considerable risks of regression: the poverty faced by young people, women, the elderly and children; the lack of prospects, which discourages birth rates, and over-indebtedness, which is of increasing concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In its programme for 2008, however, the Commission offers us, as a principal social solidarity measure, the management or execution of the Solidarity Fund, which alleviates the situation of people losing their jobs following restructurings resulting from globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is not sufficient, that we need initiatives to incentivise investment: public investment that attracts private investment. With a view to 2008 and the next three-year stage of the Lisbon Strategy, therefore, I propose to you returning to investments. Investments in transport and energy networks, investments in environmental issues and the whole issue of the management and distribution of water, and the great European projects such as GALILEO or SESAR. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to refer to two areas that I know well.</p>
<p class="contents">One is to do with the High North and you, Vice-President, were kind enough to join us at a conference that Parliament hosted in Brussels a couple of weeks ago. This brings together the issues of climate change and energy that you mentioned, but also maritime policy. It also brings together both the internal and external policies of the Union and somehow we have to get these all together in the same box and give them focus. It means the Northern Dimension. It means participation in the Arctic Council. It also means International Polar Year – which is 2008-2009. Is the European Union even at the table? Can we have a more holistic approach to these issues?</p>
<p class="contents">My second area is that of civil justice. If you look for civil justice in this, you find a bit of contract law dressed up as consumer law. You find wills and succession hidden under security and justice policy, where you also find something to do with bank account attachments. Please can we look at civil justice, which is the other side of the internal market, making it function for our companies and our citizens? Please can we call it civil justice, and can we have a pattern of civil justice that gives access to justice so that our citizens can see what is there? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today I am touching on world trade in particular, because that is my mandate. It goes without saying that I should like to see the Commission move forward on the Doha round, and Mr Mandelson, the Commissioner responsible, is doing an excellent job in pushing that forward. I want to see bilateral agreements used to get into multilateral agreements, because the Commission must look at multilateral rather than bilateral trading agreements, but using bilateral agreements to move towards them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, perhaps most importantly, I want to see a transatlantic dialogue. That has been missing and it is something that is so important to the future of the WTO. I believe that the US has failed to come to the table, and we must look at supporting President Bush in his fast-track system in order to bring Susan Schwab, the new negotiator, to the table so that she and Mr Mandelson can form a real partnership and discuss the way forward. I feel strongly that the US has failed dramatically in the reform of the farm bill, while we in the European Union have been reforming and continue to reform our agricultural policy. This is very important and I hope the Commission will stress that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on your role, Vice-President of the Commission, we should not forget economic partnership agreements. This is part of an ACP agreement. I have been drawing up the report in Parliament and it is vitally important that we finish these by the end of this year so that the Commission can stick to its programme and Africa and the countries involved know exactly what is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish on a personal note, Commissioner. This is quite important for the UK. You have just spent EUR 1.2 million on a building in the UK. I am very concerned, firstly, about the cost and, secondly, about the diplomatic status of the staff. It is not a diplomatic mission, it is there to represent the Commission, and there should be no diplomatic posts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen (ALDE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, there are three points I want to emphasise, and it is very much the budget aspect in which I am interested in this report that you have presented. The programme for better legislation is of course important, and it is not to be seen as an unambitious agenda, as some people make it out to be. On the contrary. Like other speakers, however, I think that the Commission could do a much better job of explaining the efforts now being made to simplify legislation, to assess the effects of new legislation and to involve the general public more effectively when we legislate. Many still see the EU as an ever more tentacular bureaucracy. That is an incorrect view, and I think it important to say so. I make these remarks now, in particular, while Commissioner Wallström is here, because it is of course you, Commissioner, who must convey this message.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the mid-term review of the budget, which must be prepared in 2008. On this subject, I really do hope that the Commission will be ambitious, as there is in truth good reason to doubt the Council's desire to have a genuine and open debate on shifting the priorities around over the next few years. The mid-term reform of agriculture is an important point of departure. We need a debate on the kind of agriculture we want to see, on how much or how little aid it should receive and on whether it is possible to shift resources from agricultural policy to more forward-looking areas such as research and investment in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is very important. It is said that new political priorities will require just under 1 500 more staff by 2008, just under 900 of whom will be new employees – some of them employed as a result of enlargement – while the remainder are to be obtained from re-prioritising. I do not know whether I am too impressed about it being possible to move 2% of staff around. I believe that we must set new guidelines for the EU’s and, specifically, the Commission’s personnel policy. Is there sufficient adaptability to ensure that the political priorities are met, and does personnel policy provide sufficient scope for employing the right experts, for example in the agencies? I think that we must include issues such as those too in any mid-term review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though, together with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is the committee responsible for the most legislative acts, transport always comes last. Yet transport is important. Without transport infrastructures geared towards people’s needs, there will be no growth and no employment. It is possible to order everything over the Internet, but not have it delivered via the Internet. Transport infrastructures geared towards people’s needs are a prerequisite for growth in trade, particularly between old and new Member States, and so the Commission’s approach in its strategy paper is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the most important thing is not to demonise transport. Recently, it has been postulated that, for example, no one should fly any more. The Vice-President of the Commission knows that if she wishes to travel from northern to southern Sweden, the choice is between spending hours on a train and having to fly. It is all right for people to fly, as the exhaust-gas pollution caused by air transport can be reduced considerably by means of sound policies. If we succeeded in ensuring that Member States introduced sound airspace control systems at long last, we could reduce the CO2 emissions from air transport by 8-12%. The Member States must do something about this: we should remind them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Vice-President Barrot plans to present a White Paper on urban transport. I am always somewhat doubtful as to whether urban transport is within our remit, but the Vice-President is absolutely right about one thing: urban transport accounts for a large proportion of pollution. Parliament should agree guidelines with the Member States and the regions: that transport is needed for growth and employment, but that this transport should be as efficient and environmentally friendly as possible. This will have to be discussed in greater detail. We are following the same course, therefore, Madam Vice-President – but, without transport, there will be no growth or employment in the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is a good, old friend and was a colleague of mine when I used to have a real job.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the annual policy paper, Commissioner. I think it is an excellent document. I think we should basically have four priorities. Because you are in charge of communication, I could perhaps say that there are four things that the Commission should communicate and sell.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is, of course, climate change and energy. The European Union has lacked a true project ever since the end of the Cold War. I think that we are starting to find one, and this Commission has done an excellent job on that. Congratulations on what you did in the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing you have to sell – and here I would like you to be a little firmer, so I underline what Mr Duff said earlier – is the Constitution. Stick firm on that, because it is your job to defend the Treaties and to defend the interests of the European Union as a whole. Everyone knows that it is in our interests to get that Constitution through in one form or another, most certainly not in the form of a ‘mini-treaty’.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as regards defending and selling, there is a lot of talk about protectionism nowadays in the European Union. You need to sell the single market better. The whole system is based on four freedoms: the free movement of goods, services, people and money. When you combine that with a sound consumer policy, as Mrs Kuneva is doing right now, I think you can prove that the single market has been a success story.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final element that I personally think you are doing a good job on, but in respect of which the Member States are found to be a little lacking, is enlargement. It is, after all, the most successful policy the European Union has ever had. I know we have to administer it. I know we have to go a little slower. But keep at it and keep on selling it better.</p>
<p class="contents">So my four priorities, which I find in your paper as well, are climate change, the Constitution, the single market and enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, I think that this debate has illustrated excellently the role of a directly-elected European Parliament. Parliamentarians should criticise the Commission, ask for more detailed proposals, point to what is missing or ask about the synergies between different policy proposals. You have also taken the opportunity to congratulate the Commission where appropriate and to call for the introduction of an ambitious climate policy or energy policy, for example, hopefully helping us and the European institutions to work together in implementing these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to the debate, it seems that some of you want the Commission to do more, while others want it perhaps to do a little less. The Commission will always work with the aim of making things better – better quality legislation, better coordination between the institutions and better implementation. This must be the overall goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by commenting on the procedure and the dialogue that we have started between Parliament and the Commission on the annual policy strategy. I think that it is very important that we improve the quality of this regular dialogue. I think we have already realised that the way to improve it, to make it more effective, is to make it more political. We hope that Parliament can plan in such a way as to ensure that the political groups are involved more consistently, and maybe at an earlier stage in the procedure, because this also allows us to identify in advance some of the questions mentioned here, such as what is missing entirely from our proposals or what you think is wrong with their overall structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the political groups should discuss the annual policy strategy in exactly the same way as the different committees do. I hope that the groups will feel the same commitment to this regular dialogue. The points of view expressed in the summary report and which will be endorsed by the Conference of Presidents in September have to reflect the position of both the committees and the political groups. I think that this will help us a lot.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to realise that we are at an early stage and that, when we come to the legislative and work programme, we will be able to see more of the details and a clearer outline of the specific characteristics of each and every proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on the issue of migration, because we in the Barroso Commission firmly believe that properly managed labour migration can make a very positive contribution to our economies and to our societies. As regards asylum, a question several of you also raised, we shall make proposals to approximate the criteria on the basis of which Member States can examine applications for asylum, but this will be done within the limits of the current Treaty and with full respect for the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of visas, which was also mentioned, we shall launch the visa information system, whereby Member States, while retaining responsibility for issuing visas, can exchange information and pertinent data. This is an important step in the right direction and in coordinating between Member States what has to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on simplification and better regulation. Let me start by saying that I have often heard the criticism that the Commission is legislating too little or that it is not ambitious enough in legislating. We have compiled and checked all the statistics and, if you look at the amount of legislation adopted by the Commission, it has remained remarkably stable. If we look at the number of regulations, directives, decisions and recommendations adopted over the past 10 years, it has only once topped 550 and has only once dropped below 430. The average has been some 489 proposals a year, and last year, at 474, we were very close to that average. So, whatever may be said, those are the facts. Nevertheless, with the careful consultation and impact assessments we are now carrying out on every proposal included in the work programme, I think that we are making particular efforts to ensure that our proposals are well prepared and of high quality. It is therefore important to bear these figures and statistics in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the whole issue of simplification seriously and, as you know, we have set out a very ambitious simplification programme of 100 proposals, covering about 220 legislative instruments to be repealed, codified, recast or reviewed over the next three years. On average, there have been about 40 or 43 proposals to simplify legislation or identify legislation which is outdated. We will continue along the same path and at the same pace in order to constantly review legislation. In some cases, it means that we can introduce new legislation and, at the same time, abandon or scrap directives, as we did with REACH, where the 40 existing directives were replaced by a single one.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to be careful to ensure that our legislation is up to date and modern and that we get rid of legislation that is outdated. Therefore, we will continue along the same path and will inform and involve the European Parliament so that we can work hand-in-hand to ensure that the overall political objectives of the Lisbon Strategy are implemented – the four overall priorities that we set out in our annual policy strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members raised the issue of the link between our debate on the annual policy strategy and the budgetary process. I have noted Parliament’s desire to improve this link, and it is important that we continue our dialogue on how to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We see the budget and the policy as complementary and the purpose of the annual policy strategy is precisely to set the political framework in which the annual budget is to be established. But the institutional framework is such that there is seldom a direct link between the policy initiatives undertaken in a given year and related expenditure in the same year. There is a kind of mismatch between those processes. As you know, the 2008 budget will finance actions deriving from legislative proposals presented in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">These were proposals that the co-legislators approved in 2007 or earlier. That means that the legislative proposals put forward in 2008 will have almost no budgetary implications for 2008, but will come on stream at the earliest in 2009. Also, many initiatives from the Commission have little or no costs for the EU budget at all. The Commission strongly believes that the new framework agreement put in place in 2005 actually provides a solid basis for relations. It has already improved the flow of information and enhanced the coordination of planning and programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, let me say something more about the political issues raised here. Some of you referred to the question of fundamental rights. I am surprised at the criticism of the Commission’s actions on fundamental rights. I do not think that we should doubt President Barroso’s commitment, given both his personal history and the challenges that he has faced to assert his rights and to realise his ambitions. As you know, we have just set up the European agency for fundamental rights and we are in the European Year of Equal Opportunities. I have already mentioned planned action to reinforce the protection of children and to fight discrimination outside the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">I could give a much longer list of the things that we are doing. Right now we are fighting, together with the Member States, to keep the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new Treaty. I think this is also a very basic provision and making sure that we can defend it will be an important part of the work ahead. I will pass on to President Barroso and the Commission the idea of holding a chat forum on fundamental rights. My experience is that we are never afraid of entering into debate. I think that if we can engage in different ways, we will most certainly do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked Mr Whittaker to stay, because he actually questioned the whole climate change issue. Maybe he has gone back to where he came from, to the kindergarten school of economics at which he said he studied. If he had looked at reality instead, he would have realised that we have already become poorer because of climate change. Climate change is already costing today’s society and this is a way to improve our competitiveness, to be in the lead, to say that we can show the rest of the world how we combine the best of environmental technology and the best of our knowledge society in Europe with being ambitious in aiming to use a sustainable source of energy for the future. By so doing, we can lead the way and be an example to the rest of the world. We have already shown that this is possible. That is the path we should also follow in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank all of you who have given practical examples of what needs to be implemented, because, before we know it, we will also see environmental refugees as a result of climate change and these problems. Of course, other countries have already experienced that, but, unless we take action, we too will be affected, in ways we can scarcely imagine at present.</p>
<p class="contents">So, finally, on communication, let me say that the Barroso Commission is the first to have started sending proposals directly to the national parliaments. Furthermore, we now send the same documents that we send to the European Parliament and to the Council directly to the national parliaments. The dialogue that we have engaged in – including more than 350 visits by Commissioners to national parliaments, engaging with their different committees, responding to questions, being heard by the national parliaments – is, I think, absolutely crucial in making sure that the European agenda is also anchored in national parties, in the democratic traditions of each and every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">From a communication point of view, this is very important and we have also now set out communication priorities, including better consultation, better listening and explaining, and being present locally in Member States. Without the engagement of Member States and politicians at all levels, it will be very difficult, as has already been pointed out. We also need political leaders in all the Member States to be able to defend what they have been doing at European level and to say why they have come to certain decisions. We have to engage at all levels and this is of course the intention of our communication policy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the European Union to deliver and we want results that respond to the needs and expectations of citizens all over Europe. This means better regulation. Not more or less regulation, but better regulation. It means simplification, more focused action; it means clearer communication, informing citizens and listening more attentively to them; and it also means strengthening the European Union’s institutions by completing the Treaty revision. We need stronger institutions and closer dialogue to address the challenges and the opportunities ahead of us and we will definitely play our role in these matters, making sure we can come to an institutional settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the question about renting premises, let me say that we are working together with Parliament, renting a house in London together. This is exactly how I think we should operate in future, working hand-in-hand to project a single image of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for this debate. I will of course ensure that the whole Commission is made familiar with your ideas and your positions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, thanks to the work of your rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, and to the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the European Parliament has the opportunity today to make its voice heard regarding what I consider to be a major draft agreement between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about the aviation agreement reached ten days ago between the US and European negotiators, in Brussels. In less than ten days’ time, I will be submitting this draft agreement for a political decision to the EU transport ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Your involvement has come at a crucial moment, and you can thus make the voice of Europeans heard, not only at the Council, but also within the US institutions themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">These negotiations have been long and complex. There have been four years of negotiations since the Court judgments in the so-called open skies affair. There have been 11 negotiating sessions, which have caused disruption and turbulence. However, this long negotiation can enable us to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and to make a positive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Within our reach is the possibility for a European airline to fly from any European location to any US destination, without any restrictions, and the nationality of the European airline does not matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, if you wish to fly between Brussels and Washington, you can only travel with a US or Belgian airline. Since Sabena went into liquidation, the absence of a Belgian carrier on that route has meant that you can only fly to Washington with a US airline.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Court of Justice ruled that these bilateral agreements were illegal. These agreements discriminate against our European airlines on the grounds of nationality. With this agreement, we are changing the way in which things are done. The United States recognises the European nature of our airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often we forget that not just anyone can fly to the United States. Sixteen countries have open skies agreements, but eleven do not. You cannot fly directly from the Baltic countries to the United States, and the number of routes to the United States from Spain, Ireland and Greece, in particular, is strictly limited. We are therefore going to open up new possibilities to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, from the beginning, the problem has been the balance of the agreement between Europe and the United States. In November 2005, the Council paid tribute to the progress made, progress regarding the approximation of the European and US rules on State aid, competition and security, and progress in terms of market access, but the Council also requested greater access to the US market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to explain to you why, at the end of the final round of negotiations, this agreement is more favourable to Europe. I shall not go into detail about the freedoms of air transport – the fifth freedom, the seventh freedom – as derived from the 1944 Chicago Convention. They are important, but they are technical. Any technician will see that, where these famous freedoms are concerned, the European Union has gained more than it has conceded.</p>
<p class="contents">My speech is going to focus on the airlines’ problems regarding ownership, investment and capital. Firstly, investment in the United States. US law, which Congress will not be reviewing in the short term due to intense political controversy, stipulates that foreigners cannot hold more than 25% of the voting shares in a US airline and that they cannot control it.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the backdrop of these two constraints, we have secured the right for European investors to hold more than 50% of the total capital, without, however, that being presumed to mean their having control of the airline. We have succeeded in having the US authorities process investments in a fair and expeditious manner. We have also secured the right for European investors to enter into franchise agreements. Lufthansa will be able to add its name, its brand, its colours and sell its know-how to a US airline for US domestic transport. This is not a theoretical arrangement. The Virgin group, which freely sells its books and CDs in New York, is currently trying to sell its brand in order to create Virgin America in San Francisco. The operation has come up against some serious obstacles. The commitments entered into by the United States specify what action is possible precisely for this type of investment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the provisions of the US reform, which failed in 2006 in the wake of some very strong opposition, and which some of you followed closely, it will not be possible to undermine the rights that we have negotiated. These new rights are set in stone in the agreement and will not be subject to unilateral changes in the United States. That is all I have to say about investments in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, US investment in Europe. Since the United States cannot change its 25% rule, we have retained the option to limit US investment in European airlines to the same level. This is about restoring the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, European investment in third countries. Under the current rules, we cannot invest and control a third-country airline without running the risk of undermining its traffic rights for flights to the United States. For example, Virgin has invested in Nigeria. The United States disapproves of Virgin Nigeria’s operations to the United States because the airline no longer has the right nationality. With our agreement, the United States will no longer be able to oppose Community investment in European countries outside the European Union – such as Switzerland – and in 18 African countries. There will be no comeback from the Americans on this point. They will accept the fact that these third-country airlines may receive substantial investment from European airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, third-country investment in European airlines. In line with what I just said, the United States will not challenge European-operated flights to the United States if European countries such as Iceland invest in their capital. That will enable us to attract European investment in our airlines and to standardise the air transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, ladies and gentlemen, this agreement is more balanced, and it is more balanced in the interests of Europe. We must not overlook this first stage, because we need to complete a first stage before embarking on a second one, in order to lead us to the ultimate objective of an open aviation area.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, some of the agreement’s detractors fear that there will never be a second stage because the United States will have gained in all areas during the first stage, which is inaccurate. You are right to request a mechanism that guarantees a shift to the second stage: well, I have obtained it! The negotiations will start in January 2008 at the latest. If we do not reach a second-stage agreement by the middle of 2010, we will be able to suspend the elements of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Above and beyond reprisals, I personally am convinced that the momentum that we have created will break down the last remaining resistance with regard to ownership and control.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not build the internal market in one go. We built it in three stages, but in less than 10 years. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, these 11 negotiating sessions have really made progress possible. What is at stake behind this agreement? In five years’ time, between EUR 6 billion and EUR 12 billion profit. One might also say, over the next five years, 80 000 jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and, finally, 26 million passengers who will have the opportunity to travel between Europe and the United States, in addition to the 50 million passengers who already take advantage of transatlantic flights. Thus, in five years, the number of passengers is likely to increase from 50 million to 75 million. These estimates are the outcome of serious studies.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, therefore, by saying, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement is clearly important and that it may be very valuable where Europe is concerned. I should like to add that this morning’s sitting will also help me to better perceive your expectations, to perhaps answer your questions and, once again, I would say that I am confident that we will be able to overcome this first stage and be secure in the knowledge that the second stage is now also in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have, ladies and gentlemen, the information that I wished to communicate to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us also join together to thank the US negotiating team and Mr Byerly, however, as it was no easy task for him, either, to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this agreement brings about a large transatlantic air-transport market at long last, to the benefit of air carriers and passengers. From now on, European air carriers will be able to access the US market from all parts of the EU without national restrictions. At the same time, we are implementing the 2002 judgment of the European Court of Justice. The restrictions at London Heathrow Airport contravening Community law will also have to be lifted. I am sure that the opening of the skies over the Atlantic will also give rise to attractive offers for air passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason this agreement is balanced is that the Commission has succeeded in opening up access to US markets for European air carriers a little for the first time. We could have seen more than market opening, but all the same. New regulations on ownership and control rights, licensing and branding have been put in place. I believe that these benefits are such as to justify our calling this a balanced agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is even more important, from my point of view, that we have set up a joint committee with the involvement of the business community, as this will be able to prevent, for example, the US or Europe taking unilateral security measures to the detriment of air carriers and passengers in future.</p>

In actual fact, it is only after that that this House will be able to speak out formally about the agreement, by means of a report, which I will then be drafting as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With the resolution, though, which has been compiled on my initiative with the support of the various groups, we want to send a clear message to the Council and the Commission. In a nutshell, Commissioner, you can count on our support, and we are asking the Council to approve the negotiated agreement. This agreement constitutes a major breakthrough on the road towards a fully integrated transatlantic aviation market and offers a way of escaping the legal sword of Damocles that has for some time been hanging over the aviation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Opponents of the agreement are right when they say that there is still an imbalance between the rights which US companies can assert in Europe and the rights which we can assert in the USA. There are historical reasons for this, because the US, thanks to a combination of bilateral agreements, is capable of a great deal more than us. We should not overlook the fact, though, that the European aviation market was not liberalised in one step or overnight. We were clearly in favour of one big agreement, but we think that this is not feasible politically speaking. For European consumers, this agreement is good news. As you stated before, European companies will be able to fly from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in the United States, which will lead to a greater supply and probably a reduction in prices. Moreover, the US has made a number of concessions to grant European companies a little more access to the domestic US market. You gave a few examples a moment ago. What matters to us, though, is that this should be followed up by a second step.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that if we set up a joint committee, this will allow a permanent dialogue, in which a host of aspects with regard to the social dimension, the environment, safety and security, can be addressed. We placed quite a bit of emphasis on this aspect in the resolution, because to us, the liberalisation of the aviation sector, with all its implications, both positive and negative, must coincide with the laying down of high standards in the areas I have just listed. We have noted, for example, that technical cooperation is provided for in the area of the environment so that the most efficient flight routes can be used in future. This is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">To the doubting Thomases, particularly our British fellow Members, who are under pressure, I should like to say that in my view, they too stand to benefit a great deal from the agreement. More than ever, Heathrow airport will be able to develop into the gateway to America, with more direct connections near British consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, we, for our part, will do our best to bring the subsequent stages to a successful end, by, for example, establishing contact with our counterparts from the Congress. We hope we can count on your continued involvement in future negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most Member States have concluded a separate regulation of this type with the US. With the agreement that was concluded on 2 March last, these bilateral treaties will cease to exist indefinitely. This represents an enormous step forward, which I very much welcome. After all, these bilateral agreements form a barrier to free competition if take-off and landing rights are reserved for national airline companies, something which does not benefit industry, let alone the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also how the Court judged back in 2002. And now, following years of negotiations, a reasonably balanced agreement is finally in place – not a perfect one, but a reasonable one nevertheless. I should hope, then, that the Council will lend its approval to this agreement as soon as possible, that is to say during the meeting of 22 March next.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the objections, lodged mainly by the United Kingdom, as not very constructive. Protecting your own market in 2007 is an impertinence and is far removed from the European idea. What is clear is that the new legal framework for transatlantic air transport will benefit the aviation industry, the consumer and employment too. Moreover, it offers our European airline companies the all-important legal certainty that they so desperately need.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said a moment ago, the proposal is not perfect. To this day, the US is using arguments such as safety and security to thwart the negotiations with regard to cabotage, as a result of which no progress has been made in that area. Moreover, the possibility for airline companies from the EU to monitor US airline companies effectively is still restricted, despite extensive provisions of ownership. Protecting our own market under the guise of safety and security makes no sense and is, as far as I am concerned, an admission of weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Commissioner, I am optimistic about the future, for the new framework does, after all, provide for a binding time schedule for a second agreement in which these restrictions will be retabled. If the US continues to refuse future concessions, the EU must stand firm. This is what, above all else, must be made clear to the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am indebted to the Commissioner and his team for their resolve, and I hope that we will see more of it in future. I should also like to thank our rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, for his drive and current input with regard to the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a successful outcome to the negotiations, though the latter will actually continue, as some issues have yet to be settled. The agreement will create an open transatlantic flight area, which means there will be no more arduous bilateral negotiations between the United States and individual Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the practical implications for consumers, increased competition will obviously mean a wider choice of connections and lower ticket prices for passengers. The Union has not singled out the United States for special treatment, as 16 similar earlier agreements exist between the European Union and countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The countries concerned include Croatia, Ukraine, Morocco, Lebanon, Singapore and Australia. The European Union recently concluded an agreement of this nature with Chile too. The previous speaker was right, of course, when she stated that in a sense this is an exceptional agreement because of the scale and importance of the flights concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everything has yet been done to remove barriers and liberalise services. The next stage, which must be borne very much in mind, is potential consent by the American side to facilitate investment by European companies in the US carrier market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a rare event for an agreement entered into by the European Commission to prove so uncontroversial and so clearly beneficial to European consumers. Congratulations are therefore due to the Commissioner. The open skies policy presents an opportunity for better, more frequent and cheaper links between Europeans and Americans. It will be possible to cross the Atlantic more cheaply and in greater comfort than previously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I still see the unfortunate fact that complete reciprocity is yet to be achieved as a great problem. We have to trust in a step—by-step plan for this. If the United States should fail to adhere to this plan, Parliament must ensure that Europe shows backbone. This goes for investment, and it should and must also go for the issue of the security of data transmission and, in particular, the issue of emission limits. We must ensure that European interests are not sacrificed to certain sentimentalities, or individual economic interests put above the common interest.</p>

These two partners must therefore reach agreement if we want to make any progress on international air transport. Such an agreement must primarily be evenly-balanced, acceptable to both sides and clearly specified from a technical point of view. A further prerequisite is that it must be interpreted in the same way by both parties. Ongoing negotiations have demonstrated that, just as in other areas, the United States’ approach will be discriminatory and lacking in transparency, and, moreover, that the interpretation of the agreement will, over time, alter appreciably. It is therefore vital to support further talks aimed at reaching the most balanced agreements on behalf of the EU as a whole. Despite the progress that has been made, it is still too early to talk about an integrated transatlantic market in air transport. These considerations will also be the basis for our approach to the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a closer look at some specific issues in relations between the United States and the EU. As things currently stand, there is a series of bilateral agreements between individual EU Member States and the United States. The situation is confused, and if we think we can achieve complete compliance with EU law we are deluding ourselves. The key problem at this stage is the negotiating power of the two partners. The US position in this regard is, of course, substantially stronger, leading to unfair advantages for our transatlantic partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The first such prerequisite is naturally what is referred to as cabotage. In the United States, inter-state air transport is classified as cabotage, whereas transport within the Union has yet to be incorporated as such into the Treaties. This area should be harmonised. It is likewise necessary to debate the typical protective measures that in the United States prohibit entities from other countries from controlling US aviation companies. Mr Barrot made some very good points on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly problematic is the requirement for control of infrastructure, that is, airports. The discrepancy between the stated aims concerning liberalisation and the reality is even greater in this area. As regards air transport in the Union, the discussion on the environmental impact of transport is a very topical one. Among the issues covered are the taxing of fuel, the share of emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, noise and other controversial areas. If carriers in the Union are to be committed under the Kyoto Protocol to emissions trading, it is essential that the same should apply to the competition, especially from the United States, which is our biggest competitor. We should be aware that we are setting a precedent in creating new international rules which will establish a standard for the entire sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards social conditions, I feel that the problems come mainly in three forms. The first is the obligation to have qualified crew; the second is the harmonisation of working hours, in terms of rotas for flight crew; and the third is requirements on qualifications for the ground staff who perform the pre-flight preparation of aircraft and the checks associated with stopover landings.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, in recent times, had to deal with security risks, biometric data obligations, forwarded passenger lists and various kinds of instructions and prohibitions. Accordingly, we should also remain constantly aware of the recently adopted directive on improving the situation for people of reduced mobility in air transport. Some measures introduced into airports almost come into conflict with passengers’ human rights. A typical example is the processing of passengers’ personal data. Commissioner, I would be interested to know how this relates to data protection under the Schengen System, which will be extended this year. Other measures are verging on harassment, including the repeated baggage checks on transferring inside airports. I believe that these problems will be resolved and I looking forward to working with the Commission on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have very mixed feelings about the whole issue. On the one hand, I think it is good that flying becomes more affordable and that there will be more flights available. Of course, we will have to match the increase with greater fuel efficiency in order to avoid major increases in emissions. However, if the cheaper flights wind up funnelling travel into the three major European hub airports, travelling will become more of a nightmare than it is even today.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many regional airports with the potential to open up areas of Europe to visitors and business, but I fear that they will be sidelined in the deregulated, competitive environment of open skies, if we are not careful about how it is set up.</p>
<p class="contents">The effect on regional airports and their surrounding areas needs to be assessed. In my constituency, we have for a long time been asking for an impact assessment, particularly in the Shannon area. Even at this late stage, it is important that we carry out such assessments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The example we have before us today shows, though, that there is a whole range of issues in which we need more of Europe and more of a Community approach in it, too. Looked at from that angle, then, we can do no other than welcome the conclusion of this prospective Open Sky agreement between Europe and the United States, which will replace a very large number of individual agreements and also serve as an example for many other agreements between the European Union and other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Getting a good result out of the Americans is no easy thing to do, as you, Mr Vice-President, said, and you gave a number of examples. We are aware that it may, under certain circumstances, be even more difficult to reach agreement with the present Congress, but that must not be allowed to result in the USA unilaterally securing itself particular advantages out of its negotiating position. I might well turn that around and say that it would be a good thing if the Commission and the Council were to take greater account than they have to date of the desire of the European Parliament, as the representatives of the people, to add its voice here.</p>
<p class="contents">One very practical argument in this context – something not directly the subject of the agreement, but having much to do with it – is that safety regulations in international air travel have hitherto been largely, and unilaterally, dictated by the Americans’ interests and actions, and this needs to be reviewed, and, if necessary, changed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I accept that the agreement could deliver some benefits to consumers, it has still to my mind failed to address some fundamental issues and has a number of question markets over it. In particular, the deal falls well short of providing the kind of access to the US market that a number of EU carriers would like. It does little with regard to ownership of US airlines and appears little different from previous deals rejected by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in my opinion, those who enthusiastically welcomed this agreement may need to pause a little and examine it in more detail to see what it delivers for the EU. I know the ultimate goal is to create an open aviation area with the US and I indeed support any agreement that would unlock the transatlantic aviation market. But the question is: does this deal help deliver that? To me it is a deal that promises the EU jam tomorrow and gives the US the jam today. However, if this agreement does go ahead, then we must ensure that a clear timetable is quickly put in place with real and serious incentives on both sides to move forward to a second stage deal that delivers a fully open aviation market.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I do not think this deal is a disaster, but it is not as great as the Commission would have you believe. It is merely a first step and one that would appear to benefit the US. I look forward in future agreements to the United States giving something a bit more substantial back and for that country to stop over-protecting its aviation industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, we would all have preferred a general agreement also covering the ownership, control and opening-up of the US domestic market. It is clear, however, that this preference conflicts with the highly important fact that we approached the negotiations in question with two aims in mind: an internal aim and an external aim.</p>
<p class="contents">These aims reflect a need and an interest: a need to put an end to the discrimination inside the European Union caused by having accepted the existence of such distinct markets and the possibility of bilateral agreements, which create unjust situations within the Community – something that the European Court of Justice has prohibited. Evidently, this need, which concerns Europe only, to put an end to the discrimination has weakened our ability to negotiate with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">From this we can realistically conclude that this first stage is undoubtedly ‘internal’, and in this light it is simple to predict the result of any impact assessment: there will be some countries, companies and airports that will be adversely affected by this agreement, and others that will benefit from it. The fact remains, however, that we are reducing monopolistic powers in favour of an equitable opening to all, in all countries and throughout Europe. I believe that this must be considered a positive aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the issue of security and safety, with reference both to ownership and to the opening-up of the internal market. It is clear that, for the United States, this may represent a valid reason or an excuse. We must remove any element of excuse. Agreement on security and safety rules must be paramount, to enable this issue to be resolved, since a solution to this problem would invalidate every other argument on insecurity attributable to the foreign ownership of companies within the United States, or on insecurity attributable to the opening-up of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that, in the United States, security as a whole comes under the federal budget, and from this point of view it would be useful for Europe to reflect on the way in which we approach the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am afraid, though, that I am going to have to disagree with some of my friends here, because, although I applaud efforts to open markets, the markets must be opened fairly and I fear that this agreement does not go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only would the current proposals cause harm to British business, but they could also have a detrimental effect on some of our EU businesses generally as well. What is now on the table will undoubtedly give US companies a substantial share of our unregulated market, while EU companies will be left to fight for the scraps of the US regulated market. I think we should be fighting harder for reciprocal agreements on ownership rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current deal as I understand it, US interests can own up to 49 % of the voting stock of an EU airline, whereas EU interests can only own up to 25 % voting stock of a US airline, and I am not sure that is fair or open. According to the Court of Justice, any transatlantic negotiation should fully honour Member State bilateral agreements, such as Bermuda II, and I think this agreement does not adequately deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is seeking to harmonise its policy and has not taken into account the full differences between states. What we are calling for on this matter is continuing action rather than just dialogue. I think the Commission has certainly moved things forward, but it is also important that, when we go back to the negotiating table in three months’ time – which, again, I welcome – there must be some firm commitments from the United States to take more action in response to our needs in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, this success follows the pressure exerted by, amongst others, this Parliament, which supported the Commission’s open skies strategy from the outset, and encouraged it in the face of increasing difficulties, as in the case of these complicated transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement has the great virtue of strengthening those transatlantic relations at a crucial time for everybody: on the eve of elections in the United States and at a time when we need to make progress with environmental requirements for Europe's aviation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It also helps to strengthen European identity and the European Union’s identity as a global partner. In that regard, I believe that this agreement sends a good message to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also an agreement that makes a decisive contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and specifically, in the case of anti-trust immunity, to facilitating commercial agreements and the development of alliances amongst airlines, which undoubtedly promote the growth and democratisation of air travel amongst the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It also contains provisions on technical cooperation with regard to climate change, which I hope will be useful in terms of tackling the impact of the aviation sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased with the provisions on the control of airlines and, with regard to the security mentioned by Mr Costa, the truth is that I would prefer us firstly to analyse the results of the United States system in depth, since its reliability has very much been called into question on occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now finally overcome the remaining resistance in the Council and I hope that the work of Mr El Khadraoui will be of use to you in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will benefit the travelling public.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition within the aviation sector has revolutionised air travel. Air passengers now have choice, and low-fare, no-frills air travel has become the order of the day. Passengers will benefit even more under the new arrangement. The ownership issue, which was a problem for the United States, has hopefully been resolved by way of an honourable compromise. But I would agree with my colleagues Mr Simpson and Mr Kirkhope and I would encourage the Commission to be very tough in future negotiations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the Commission for the strong stand it has taken in refusing to allow individual bilaterals between Member States within the EU and the United States. Such bilaterals would undermine and delay the agreement just reached. The new arrangement will hopefully offer some protection to Shannon Airport on the west coast of Ireland. For over 70 years, Shannon airport has been the gateway airport between the United States and Ireland. All planes travelling to and from the US stopped off at Shannon. In recent years, this compulsory stopover has been diluted. But, crucially, the new agreement would incorporate a transition period for airports such as Shannon to enable them to adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important that the open skies agreement be reviewed every few years in order to monitor the impact of the agreement on Shannon and other similar airports. The agreement is a very historic one. Indeed, it is the most historic since the 1944 Chicago Convention. I would commend both sides, and the Commission in particular, for rescuing an agreement that a few short months ago seemed doomed to failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU-USA air services agreement will therefore be beneficial to consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. It will help deepen transatlantic relations and serve as a model for further liberalisation and approximation of legal provisions the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice ruling states that several bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the United States do not comply with the European Union’s legal principles, and that the EU-USA air services agreement is the best way of ensuring full compliance with Union legislation. The harmonisation of legal provisions, notably in the area of safety, environmental protection and workers’ social rights is especially important in this type of air services agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental issue is close cooperation between the appropriate EU and US authorities concerned with aviation safety, both at EU and US federal level and also at Member State level. The aim should be to create a single aviation protection area, which implies a single passenger and baggage check at the start of the journey, not at each transfer as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that exchange of passengers’ personal data between the EU and the US must be undertaken respecting the privacy of European and American citizens. This has already been made clear in European Parliament resolutions. The transatlantic air services agreement must be founded on the Convention on Human Rights and on other international acts guaranteeing citizens’ rights and freedoms.</p>

The debates and negotiations have been going on for years now. Your task was difficult but you have managed to be persuasive and effective. I should like to pay tribute to the agreement reached because it is a good agreement for European interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberalisation of transatlantic air traffic is in fact going to boost the growth of our airlines at a time when they are facing an increase in the price of kerosene, increasingly strict security constraints and a forthcoming tax introduced as part of the fight against global warming. By allowing them from now on to operate flights to the United States from any European city and no longer just from their country of origin, you are generating more activities for our airlines and thus more jobs to offer to our fellow citizens. More routes and also more freedom regarding the frequency and times of flights will also mean more choice for consumers: European and US passengers will therefore be the second big winners as a result of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A third source of satisfaction is the opportunity now provided to European airlines to acquire more than 50% of the capital of US airlines. One might certainly regret the fact that our US friends are preventing the market from operating freely by refusing to grant more than 25% of voting rights to European airlines, but let us not turn our noses up because things are sometimes best left as they are. Furthermore, you said, Commissioner, that the agreement stipulated in return the option for the Union to limit US equity investment in our airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Jarzembowski, I should like to conclude by urging the European transport ministers to give their full support in a few days’ time to the Commission, because it is the interests of one of our largest economic sectors that are at stake, and we need to protect them. Faced with the United States, this kind of result would not have been possible without the pooling of our resources. On our own, we cannot achieve much; together, Commissioner, anything is possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, it is a long time since Columbus reached the new world in an ecologically acceptable way. And it is a long time since the monopolistic extremism that brought so much backwardness to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has just reached an air transport agreement with the United States which opens up new prospects for European air companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vice-President of the Commission, allow me to congratulate you most warmly on all of the work you have done. I would also like to congratulate your director, Mr Daniel Calleja, and, if you will allow me, Mr Vice-President, to mention the spirit that I am sure is contained in this agreement, also your predecessor, Mrs Loyola de Palacio.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that this is a significant achievement on the part of the Commission. I hope that the Council will unequivocally approve this agreement as soon as possible. Bilateral agreements between the United States and the Member States need to be replaced by broader agreements. And if the agreement can be applied from October, as the Commission intends, then all the better.</p>
<p class="contents">When that is the case, when the single sky is a reality, the European citizens and companies will enjoy many advantages: common rules on both sides of the Atlantic, the possibility of opening up new passenger and goods transport routes, as well as lower costs, which will make our companies and our air transport more competitive. All of this should benefit consumers in terms of the final price of their tickets.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate objective of these agreements is the creation of a future area of free provision of air services between the United States and the European Union, which will conform to the Lisbon Strategy and enhance transatlantic relations, which are so necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was having difficulty with the lifts.</p>
<p class="contents">Transatlantic tourism is of vital importance to Ireland, and there is much room for expansion. Of the nearly seven million people who visited Ireland in 2005, over half a million of them came from across the Atlantic, contributing over EUR 500 million to the Irish economy. It has been estimated that these numbers could triple if the open skies agreement is ratified, and generate an extra EUR 1 billion for the Irish economy. With the advent of open skies, we can continue to benefit from the goodwill we have received from hosting events such as the Tour de France, the Special Olympics and the Ryder Cup. If a small country like Ireland can benefit in that way, what potential is there for the continent of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we should be concerned about climate change, but the answer is to find new fuels for air transport and make more efficient use of existing fuels. Protectionism does not benefit the consumer or our economies. A clear open skies policy not only encourages individuals to travel to Europe but also helps to promote European goods in North America. Open skies opens up more of the American market to European consumers and business people. Our ability to travel and trade with more cities can only help to boost our economies and allow us additional access to the strong US economy, especially now, given the current strength of the euro against the dollar. This bodes well for European business.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the economic and cultural exchanges that will be made possible by this agreement will ensure that the United States and Europe maintain a healthy relationship for years to come, and I urge the Commission and the Council to resist protectionism and self-interest in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that we are on the verge of concluding an historic agreement where transatlantic relations are concerned, historic, too, in terms of moving aviation forward in the world and – as has been pointed out – of making air transport democratic and putting it within the reach of as many people as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go back over the benefits of the agreement, which have been emphasised by, among others, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr El Khadraoui, to whom I am particularly grateful for his initiative. Access for airlines from any European country to any location in the United States, without discrimination on nationality grounds, is one of the very important benefits. That, above all, will enable us, Mr Costa, to resolve certain legal problems that emerged in the wake of the open skies judgments. Another huge benefit for consumers is the fact that they have more choice at better prices. Furthermore, we are opening up to 60% of the world’s traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought not to forget that a joint committee exists that will play a key role with regard to applying the agreement, to debating social issues, to addressing the issues of ownership and control, to competition, to aid and to environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you raised the problem of security, not least Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert. This agreement contains provisions that are crucial in terms of facilitating the controls on both sides of the Atlantic and of eventually having equivalent systems that will allow us to move in the direction of a single form of security control, or ‘one stop security’.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to environmental aspects, I should like specifically to address Mrs Lichtenberger in order to tell her that she is right. We intend precisely to cooperate far more effectively with the Federal Aviation Administration. On this subject, we are going to review the way in which we operate flights over the Atlantic with the aim of reducing their flight paths. We are also going to research solutions enabling us to use fuel efficiently and to reduce emissions. There is therefore an entire environmental section there.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you raised the problem of cabotage, not least Mr Kohlíček. The option of operating cabotage services in the United States is much debated; we will not have that option to start with. Nor will cabotage be permitted for US airlines: thus, a US airline is not permitted to transport passengers or cargo between Frankfurt and Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sinnott, the agreement will also benefit regional airports by opening up new opportunities with the elimination of the existing restrictions. Mr Rack and several of you emphasised security problems. The United States has acknowledged the importance of working on common practices and standards in order to reduce as far as possible the differences between the European Union and the United States on these issues, and it will take account of the measures that have already been applied within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Simpson, the transatlantic area will clearly not be built in one go. We are, in fact, talking here about a first stage, but one that has already established a very strong link with the second stage: Europe will be able to suspend Americans’ access rights if they drag their feet and if no progress is made. We therefore have the means to act in order to guarantee that there really will be a second stage towards our ultimate aim.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Kirkhope that, since the United States has not yet agreed to change its 25% rule, we have retained the option of limiting its investment in European airlines at the same level. This is one way of restoring the balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you asked me to be brief. I should therefore like to apologise to the speakers to whom I have not had time to respond clearly. I should like to thank all of the speakers and also to say to those MEPs who belong to Member States that are not covered by the ‘open skies’ agreements, and particularly to the Irish Members who spoke, that the will exists on our side to extend the benefits of this liberalisation of transatlantic air transport to all of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Veyrac and other speakers stressed that all of this is the fruit of extensive efforts. I should like to take this opportunity to remember Mrs Loyola de Palacio, who also did a great deal of work on this first stage, which I feel is important for the future of Europe and of transatlantic relations, for the economy and for employment.</p>

In the interests of consistency, it should, however, be accepted that, where the new Member States are concerned, a certain amount of interest offsetting might take place to prevent mass unemployment from being created in the poorer parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This report concerns an extension to a regulation that has existed since 2004 and that compensates those new Member States whose interest substantially exceeds the EU average. The cost of an extension amounts to approximately EUR 10 million per year. It has been proposed that funding be obtained from savings within other budget headings so that there are no additional aggregate budget increases. The Commission also regards this extension as part of a package in which the removal of subsidies for maize cultivation is also proposed – a step that would mean a significant saving of approximately EUR 35 million in 2008 (with, according to the Commission, a total saving for 2008-2014 of EUR 617.8 million).</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, a ‘no’ vote would be in danger not only of having a bad effect on the new Member States, but also of jeopardising the Commission’s proposed saving of just over EUR 600 million. I have therefore chosen, in spite of everything, to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In France, the notion of ‘socially responsible companies’ came about specifically at the time of the Sudreau report in 1975.

Companies that consider themselves to be socially responsible owe it to society to reduce to a minimum the negative social and environmental effects of their activities. Meanwhile, since many initiatives have claimed the label of ‘socially responsible’, consumers can no longer see the wood for the trees and every inspection becomes an impossible task to the layman. Moreover, the effects of the free market and the destructive nature of the constant quest for the lowest prices is progressively becoming a matter of common knowledge. Regulations are needed in this area in order to strengthen the consumer’s hand and reinforce the supporting structure of the odd well-meaning company. Europe can play a pioneering role on the social responsibility front by developing policy that creates, and enforces, standards whilst at the same time guaranteeing a level playing field.</p>

Neither the music industry, Parliament, nor the Council have been consulted, and the ‘soft legislative approach’ proposed by the Commission has already influenced market decisions, which makes it more than a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, companies that want to offer online music services in Europe must organise the rights with copyright organisations and record companies in each country individually. The Commission is right to say that this can be simplified. The recommendation, however, opens up the possibility for a completely free market, which could put cultural diversity and local repertoire at risk, as attracting the most profitable right-holders is, indeed, a more viable proposition for collective copyright managers. Moreover, the Commission rates commercial interests higher than cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">This House argues in favour of controlled competition by prescribing a number of clear conditions, such as the equal treatment of authors, a fair and transparent competition structure which prevents the income of authors from going down and a fair representation of all interested parties in the management structures. This report values unity in diversity, and so it can count on my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Lévai presented a very good report to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical progress and the development of our civilisation have resulted in the emergence of a new generation of cross-border commercial copyright users. These are the suppliers of Internet music services. It shows how the market in copyright and related rights is evolving and developing, which further confirms the need for the initiatives taken in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As we conduct the debate we are engaged in we should also bear in mind the possibility of responding to future needs resulting from the nature of collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights. For that reason also, it is essential to conduct an in depth study of the impact of multi-territorial and multi-range licences for online music services and of the effects on the socio-economic situation of the rightholders and on cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So, then, the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is, and remains, the fundamental cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The European Union endorses the provisions of the NPT and advocates and endorses measures aimed at further reinforcing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thinking forward to the first meeting of the committee preparing the conference on the review of this treaty in 2010, the European Union has already started to do extensive preparatory work at home. We are firmly determined to continue, in 2007, to play an active and constructive role in the debates at the preparatory conference, and since our intention is that the European Union should begin the review cycle in a constructive atmosphere, it is strongly endorsing the plans put forward by the Japanese ambassador Amano, who has been appointed as the chairman of the first preparatory committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union takes the view that all three pillars of the Non-Proliferation Treaty – those being nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy – must be considered and held in balance in the review debate. It is that sort of even-handedness alone that will make it possible for the forthcoming review cycle of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to progress successfully, and it is on that, though, that the joint decisions to be taken by the review conference on the reinforcement of the treaty depend. The Common Position of the European Union, as adopted on the occasion of the 2005 review conference, remains, unchanged, the basis of these even-handed positions by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always attached great importance to the prompt entry into force of the Test Ban Treaty, and this has acquired even greater relevance since the North Koreans tested an atom bomb. The European Union is already helping to shore up the atom test ban regime by adopting common actions intended, among other things, to further reinforce the treaty’s verification system.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also calling for a prompt start to negotiations on a treaty outlawing the production of fissile material for explosive purposes, and for such negotiations to be conducted without preconditions. Conclusion of such a treaty would constitute a considerable step on the road to the control of nuclear weapons and to nuclear disarmament, and would thereby make a decisive contribution to the implementation of the positions agreed on and adopted by the Community at the review conferences in 1995 and 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The consolidation and reinforcement of the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty are still largely conditional upon the dedicated and complete discharge of all obligations arising from it, and particular attention needs to be paid to the regional dimension in this regard. You will be aware that the EU is actively involved in the efforts to resolve the crisis occasioned by the Iranian nuclear programme. We are persuaded that a solution can be reached only by diplomatic means, and so the European Union had a pivotal role in shaping the very generous offer made to Iran in June 2006, and I would emphasise that this was supported by the United States, Russia and China. The European Union will also continue to work towards a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is well aware of the risks attendant on any further spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology, and therefore supports efforts towards multilateral guarantees on the supply of nuclear fuel. Initiatives to this end can also help to persuade countries with an interest in the development of nuclear power that the development of their own nuclear fuel cycle is not necessary, with the effect that they will then freely and voluntarily refrain from acquiring one.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will be stepping up its efforts at maintaining and further reinforcing the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to be able to meet the challenges I have described, and these include the debate largely initiated by the EU on the strengthening of the Treaty’s provisions relating to the consequences of a withdrawal from it. It is to be regretted that the 2005 treaty review conference was unable to agree on a substantial final document that would have constituted a response to the most pressing challenges to the Treaty. This experience must be another reason for the European Union to make every effort to make the 2010 review process a successful one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nuclear weapons proliferation is headline news, not least when it concerns Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iran, we are still at a delicate stage. We noted with concern Dr ElBaradei’s recent report that Iran has not yet suspended its enrichment-related activities and does not appear to have taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1737. The European Union’s External Relations Council has just formally adopted a common position calling for the necessary firmness to be shown by the international community. We are serious about the double-track policy which, as Mr Gloser has just outlined, has been cemented also by the recent ‘three and three’ talks in London. This means that we may aim at maintaining dialogue and enhancing our contacts with civil society, as well as also exerting pressure. Discussions in New York are now focusing on moving beyond the existing sanctions towards a new Security Council resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">On North Korea, we welcome the results of the Six Party Talks held in Beijing on 13 February 2007. The EU is consulting with the Six, offering the best means by which we can assist in this process, while remaining committed to the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1718. We support very strongly the current mission of Dr ElBaradei to North Korea aiming at the return of the IAEA inspectors as part of this accord and I share his assessment that this is a crucial confidence-building process. I hope that the shutdown of the Yongbyon plant goes ahead by mid-April.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) established the non-proliferation regime as we know it – with its fundamental balance between nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. From it then followed several aspects which are of great importance to the European Union, namely the principle of regulated nuclear trade, nuclear safeguards and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors compliance. Strengthening the effectiveness of the NPT will make the world safer. States parties should be encouraged to work towards this aim with a view to the upcoming review conference.</p>
<p class="contents">While the headlines have focused on the regime’s difficulties, we should not underestimate its successes. South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and Libya, for example, have all decided to forego nuclear weapons programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">My recent visit to India also gave me an opportunity to stress to the Indian leadership our hope that India will come much closer to the NPT regime and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to civil nuclear cooperation with India, once the necessary preconditions are met. These developments should also increase Pakistan’s willingness to cooperate with the international community in the non-proliferation context. Nuclear non-proliferation is an area in which the Commission makes an important contribution. Since 1957, the Euratom Treaty has provided the Commission with wide-ranging responsibilities. The Commission’s safeguard activities are closely coordinated with the IAEA, freeing up its resources to be deployed to more troublesome regions of the world. We are also playing our part in ensuring that the EU’s nuclear export controls are as robust as possible, supporting the Dual-Use Regulation 1334 from the year 2000. We also assist third states in enhancing their export controls and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and radiological materials.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also a major provider of assistance for international non-proliferation efforts. One important example is the G8 Global Partnership against Weapons of Mass Destruction, where one billion euros have been pledged for assistance in the former Soviet Union, 400 million of which have already been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">For more than 25 years the Commission’s Joint Research Centre has been working closely with the IAEA, providing it with scientific and technological support.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, in the future we will do more. Under the new Instrument for Stability we will have resources to continue and strengthen work to enhance our security against nuclear proliferation threats. In closing, let me take the opportunity to thank this Parliament once again for the support it has given the Commission in setting up a new generation of non-proliferation assistance programmes through a series of pilot projects.</p>

This treaty historically has been of fundamental importance in preventing proliferation and promoting nuclear disarmament and it is for this reason that it was extended unconditionally for an unlimited period in 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office of the Council stated, the treaty is based on three principles: disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. If we start again from these three principles, adjusted for today’s international situation, we can give new impetus to the treaty, remembering that the balance achieved through the application of the treaty by over 180 countries is today in danger. Today the international community is faced with new threats to its security.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strenuously reaffirm the principle whereby the treaty is the single, indispensable, multilateral instrument for maintaining and reinforcing peace, security and international stability, since it establishes the legal framework to prevent a growing proliferation of nuclear weapons. The European security strategy and the European strategy on weapons of mass destruction emphasise the importance of nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and the treaty itself, which all the Member States have signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Having summarised the situation, I believe it is vital for the European Parliament to be clear about the position for the future. The European Union must remain committed to the implementation of the treaty, and must present a united front at Vienna, where preparations will be made for the 2010 review conference. For this reason, it will be fundamental for the European Parliament to vote unanimously, sending out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission, so that at Vienna they can have the necessary authority to play an active role in strengthening the current non-proliferation system.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve the objectives set out in the treaty, the European Union must contribute to a structured and balanced review, at the review conference, of the way the treaty operates. This must include the implementation of the undertakings made by the signatory States and the identification of sectors and methods through which to achieve future progress, as well as further development of the inspection system to guarantee that nuclear energy is used for exclusively peaceful ends by States not possessing nuclear weapons and recognised as such.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reaffirm the principle whereby all possible cooperation in terms of the development of nuclear energy for peaceful ends must take place on the basis of the treaty, and it is in this sphere that the European Union can make a decisive contribution, since it is at the forefront of research and production.</p>
<p class="contents">The international situation demands that we display a commitment to non-proliferation, to disarmament and to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Finally, I hope that Europe can also have a united strategy for combating terrorist organisations that might gain access to weapons of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work of reconciliation that brought Europe into the world has also made us a zone in which peace prevails and in which military action between the partner states of the European Union has become virtually unthinkable. That is the foundation that must underpin the philosophy of a security policy for the European Union, which is that we must take this concept of peace, which we have made a reality at home, and export it to the world as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament base this thinking on a concept of security that relies on dialogue, diplomacy, disarmament, prevention, and on sustainable and fair development. All these elements belong together, and are held together by sustainable conflict resolution, which itself is feasible only within the framework of an overall conception. While the European Union and NATO have their parts to play in this, so, too, do others – Russia, for example – and that is why we, when we talk about disarmament initiatives – about which I shall have more to say in a moment – have to ask ourselves whether Russia is our partner or our adversary. In view of what I have just said, I would recommend approaching it as a partner, engaging in dialogue with it rather than marginalising it.</p>
<p class="contents">Disarmament is one of the central issues when peoples seek to coexist, and the trustworthiness of parties to treaties is crucial. If, as we review the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty today, we take a really close look, we will have to see that the record is a downright shameful one, for, since it was signed, no fewer nuclear weapons have been dispersed around the world, but rather significantly more of them, and that cannot be attributable to the signatory states, or some of their number, taking this treaty seriously, for the very opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many who, having signed this treaty, promptly proceeded to disregard it and instead, contrary to what had been agreed, exported nuclear weapons, or the technology needed to produce them, around the world. This is where there is a need for a complete turnaround. Fundamental to any review of the Treaty is the intention to be faithful to it; that is why a primary condition for the renewal of the Treaty is that those who sign it abide by it, and the United States of America have not been alone in failing to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">A world free of nuclear weapons may well sound like something out of a daydream, for we do not live in one – the very opposite is the case. We are having a debate on the spread of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and on that I think congratulations are in order. We have just heard from your own lips about the efforts required to prevent the civil use of nuclear energy becoming military, and Iran is a case in point here. More nuclear power stations are being built all around the world, and then we are surprised to find ourselves lumbered with not just one Iran, but many.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of any review of military nuclear policy must be asking critical questions about civil use. The German Council Presidency has the opportunity to put this issue on the agenda of the Council and also of the G8, and critical questions also need to be asked about the anti-missile system that is now, at the American administration’s behest, to be installed in the Czech Republic and in Poland in line with the Bush administration’s philosophy, the inconsistency of which can hardly be surpassed, the delusory nature of which is demonstrated by many examples, and which is set to cost USD 58 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a recommendation to make. It is that, rather than having us Europeans allow ourselves – yet again – to be divided – for we can say goodbye to any single foreign and security policy if we in the EU cannot agree on something like this, these 58 billion dollars would, rather than being spent on the installation of anti-missile systems, be better invested in sustainable development, which would make more of a contribution to peace than the setting up of a dodgy missile system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the reason why I venture to say that with reference to the non-proliferation treaty and the review thereof, is that these things are interconnected, and I hope that Mrs Merkel, having announced that this issue will be put on the agendas of both the G8 and the EU, will see to it that it is.</p>

<p class="contents">Having had a little browse in older documents related to this subject, I came across the 13 practical steps that were agreed upon during the Non-proliferation Treaty review conference in 2000, which is less than seven years ago. When I read those steps, I, too, cannot fail to conclude that we really have not made any progress at all, and that if anything, we have done the exact opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the brutal attacks of 11 September 2001 and everything that followed have, in fact, brought the serious efforts in the area of disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament in particular to a standstill. This is something I deeply regret. I am also – and I am also speaking personally when I say this – very worried about the lack, to date, of any group position on the initiatives with regard to the Member States Poland and the Czech Republic. I too wonder whether this might not be the start of a fresh arms race, which is surely the last thing we need.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to take note of the presidency’s assurance that a great deal of hard work will go into a common position of all Member States with a view to the conference this coming April. I hope, Mr President, that you – or rather the Presidency – will indeed succeed in this, because the poor result in 2005 was attributable to a lack of true unanimity among the EU Member States. I hope that history will not repeat itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look at the Council and Commission documents, however, it must be said that they are more optimistic, and in my view, if we assess what has actually been achieved then the progress made by the European Union must be acknowledged. The European Union’s institutions permanently collaborate to coordinate their work. Of course, the High Representative for the CFSP works actively on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament issues, we at the European Parliament regularly consider these issues, there are discussions between the institutions and exchanges of information with the European Union Situation Centre and the counter-terrorism coordinator. This means that work is actually being done, but the cases of North Korea and Iran, the unsuccessful conference in 2005 to review the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and differences between the United States of America, China and Russia show that much still remains to be done. I would therefore like to express my appreciation for the advance preparations for the 2010 conference on the review of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, and I would also ask the Council to take into consideration the European Parliament’s wish to play an active part in this work, as well as the initiative expressed in Parliament’s resolution, and in the very near future to include MEPs in this conference to work as members of the European Union delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner has already sketched out the various problem areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, then, take a brief look back to twenty years ago, to 8 December 1987, when a shock went around the world, for, before the Cold War’s nuclear threat had passed, the INF Treaty was signed, constituting real agreement on nuclear disarmament. Where are we now? It has to be said, with regret, that we have in some respects gone backwards, for both Kofi Annan and Henry Kissinger have said that the campaign against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the efforts at nuclear disarmament are on the point of complete and final failure.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we in Europe do in this situation? Do we have enough confidence to raise – multilaterally and in international fora – issues on which we can hope to see progress made? Would it not be timely to use the forthcoming meeting of the Nuclear Supplies Group in Cape Town from 16 to 20 April as an opportunity to speak out against the planned deal between India and the USA? If we do not do that, what kind of signal is being sent to the other states? Are we not then saying to them, ‘Build nuclear programmes and nuclear weapons, even outside the NPT, and the USA will even reward and support you’? What kind of signal does that send to Iran?</p>
<p class="contents">I say that quite deliberately, and as one who takes a decidedly different view of these things. Where Iran is concerned, we are stuck in a cul-de-sac, and we have helped ourselves get into it. Everyone in it needs to put themselves into reverse gear in order to get back out again, or else the troops will end up being sent in.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to help keep this Treaty alive. On Thursday, we will be adopting a resolution to the effect that a delegation will be sent to Vienna to actively monitor this process, and I hope that we will, there, together, enable these important NPT provisions to give signs of continued life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the 3 March edition of the <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung</span>, the Americans are planning new nuclear warheads, and that is something on which we take a critical line. In the UK – an EU Member State – Mr Blair, the Prime Minister, wants to spend EUR 30 billion on modernising the British armed forces’ nuclear weaponry. The British House of Commons is due to vote on it tomorrow. That is nuclear rearmament and puts the non-proliferation treaty at risk; a critical statement from the German Presidency of the Council is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the protests against the nuclear programme whereby the USA plans a missile defence system in the Czech Republic, Poland and in the Caucasus, with NATO – according to Mr de Hoop Scheffer as reported yesterday – wanting to take part with one of its own. The German Minister for the Armed Forces, Mr Jung, wants to put the whole system under NATO control. It is about time the Council and the Commission got round to expressing forthright criticism of these anti-missile schemes, and, together with two colleagues, I have tabled a declaration expressing opposition to this system.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, according to the former NATO commander-in-chief Wesley Clark, preparations are in hand for a war against Iran. It is hypocrisy to criticise Iran if we ourselves possess nuclear weapons and are engaged in updating them. The nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty requires that all nuclear weapons be disposed of. The fact is that there are no good nuclear weapons, and what is needed, and right now, is disarmament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, the entire multilateral arms control structure is at risk of collapsing – truly, a spectre menacing the whole world. Meanwhile, the question arises as to what sort of authority the UN Security Council is left with, when UN members stock up on nuclear weapons against its express will.</p>
<p class="contents">Do the Council and Commission share my view that the crisis of the NPT is also a crisis situation for the highest international authority? Given this extremely serious situation, I expect them to make a maximum effort to convince the UN Security Council to persuade Pyongyang and Teheran away from their ominous nuclear course, as time is pressing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also, alas, cannot fail to see that the review conference has, for the moment, proved abortive, and that is why this preparatory conference in Vienna is so important. It is also of the very utmost importance that this House should be able to contribute its opinion to it, but the effectiveness of this is conditional upon the resolution being a joint effort, and one reflecting all our views. I hope that we will achieve that sort of result when we come to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Soviet Union collapsed, we all believed that the days of mutually assured destruction were behind us, but, today, the risk is that, while that may have been banished from the global stage, it may be about to resume regionally. We must, together, do everything in our power to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about one of the proposals, of which there are many, namely the international system for uranium enrichment, something that has now acquired extraordinary importance, but I also want to say something about another matter that is not directly connected with this debate, although it does have to be the subject of public discussion, and that is the issue of the anti-missile system.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, we are currently discussing an American anti-missile defence system and its effects on us, but what must be of real interest to us is the security of Europe. The Iranian rockets against which the Americans are protecting themselves, are much closer to Europe than they are to America. We are told, for example, that these Iranian rockets are already capable of reaching Southern Italy and Greece, and that is why we have to have a general debate on the question of whether this sort of system is needed, for if it is, it is we, Europeans, who need it just as much. That is something else that we in this House must discuss and on which we have to reach decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the spread of weapons of mass destruction forms an increasing threat to international peace and security, we must reassess the treaty, breathe new life into it and strengthen it.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the developments in Iran are causing us great concern. Despite repeated warnings from the international community, Iran continues its efforts in the area of uranium enrichment. At the same time, we know that there is a real risk that terrorist groups have access to nuclear weapons or similar.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, an effective multilateral stance is indispensable. What is more, the Non-Proliferation Treaty stands or falls by it. By acting independently and unilaterally, though, all common efforts in this area are set to be undermined. This is why the recognised nuclear powers must make a visible investment. They are, in fact, also responsible for the credibility of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as it currently stands. Precisely in this light, we are placing question marks by the recent attempt by the US to get Poland and the Czech Republic to agree to the stationing elements of an anti-rocket shield on their territories. According to the Americans, the rocket defence system offers protection against possible attacks from North Korea and Iran. This does, in fact, go against the intention to prevent these countries from developing a nuclear arms arsenal.</p>
<p class="contents">With their proposal, the Americans are also ignoring the concerns of Russia, which, rightly or wrongly, regards the rocket shield as a provocation, or even as a threat to its domestic security. A protective shield that subsequently leads to mistrust between the three key partners – the US, Russia and the EU – that wish to stop proliferation, is not exactly the multilateral action we had in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we wonder how such bilateral cooperation fits into the European security strategy and the NATO partnership. For this reason, we have major objections to this course of affairs, and we therefore call on the United States and the EU Member States involved to reconsider the plans and to seek multilateral alternatives compatible with the security arrangements mutually agreed by us in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately the whole story of the NPT is singularly lacking in success stories. North Korea has withdrawn from the system, and has launched its own military nuclear programme. Iran, too, has turned against the system, and we do not know how far along things are, but its intentions are in any case not favourable. India, Pakistan and Israel show no inclination to join.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are some positive developments as well: on 16 February, the Six-Party Talks at Beijing gave rise to an agreement. We will soon find out what the value of such an agreement is. Mr El Baradei will visit North Korea tomorrow, and his visit will no doubt ascertain whether the intentions of the North Koreans are sincere. The current action is very significant. Respect for the whole NPT is at stake. We need to combine flexibility with consistency. We must be flexible in methods and timing, but we cannot be flexible as regards goals. The goals must be clear and unambiguous. North Korea must return to the NPT system and immediately put a stop to the military nuclear programme. The way we handle the problems of North Korea will have a direct influence on Iran as well. If we are successful in North Korea, then we will also succeed in relation to Iran. If we should fail to achieve success here, then it is to be feared that we will not be able to keep even Iran on the right path.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the review conference will be real and successful if we can thereby face these two great challenges, namely North Korea and Iran, and successfully solve these two problems.

How ironic is it, then, that tomorrow the UK Government is likely to take a decision to replace the Trident nuclear submarine system that will precisely accelerate that proliferation and thus undermine our collective security? When it does so, it will be demonstrating the most breathtaking hypocrisy: maintaining and further developing the UK’s own nuclear weapons, whilst waging illegal wars to try to stop others from obtaining them. What moral authority can the UK Government possibly think it has to lecture countries like Iran about not developing nuclear weapons, when we ourselves continue to do exactly that?</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt about the need for us to get started, right now, on preparing the review conference in good time, in order, there, to set out our priorities as we need to do, but it is even more important by far that we should be trying, right now, to take measures to reinforce the credibility of the international community and of the European Union where the implementation and enforcement of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty are concerned, for the quality of that treaty will be measured in terms of the successes it actually achieves. At present, I see the chances of such strategies being implemented as very good, particularly in view of what I see of the situation in North Korea and the contacts we have with both the South and the North of that land in my capacity as Chairman of the Parliament’s delegation for relations with the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Union of ours, and our Parliament in particular, have helped bring about the resumption of the six-party talks, in which we are a welcome partner, albeit not as part of the six-party talks, but warmly welcomed as a facilitator and as an outside source of support, and we have played our part in getting the talks restarted on 13 February.</p>
<p class="contents">I am cautiously optimistic. What is at stake is that disarmament be put into effect; we have been assured that it will be, and now is the time for North Korea to take action, but, contrariwise, it is also necessary that we, as a Union, should play our part in taking action that will help bring about political change in North Korea, by, for example, supporting the food security, regional security and human security programmes, with the ultimate goal of a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons, so that the present threat – not least to Europe – fades away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe’s position should be based on two essential ideas: strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency and pressing for compliance with Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In this respect, I agree that updating Trident is incompatible with Article 6 of the NTP and, since it affects the United Kingdom, it also affects the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must support the multilateral approach to uranium enrichment and ensure that all countries sign the additional protocol to the safeguard agreement. That may prevent further challenges like those posed by Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the EU must do all it can to ensure that the 13 steps to disarmament identified at PrepCom 2000 are implemented as quickly as possible. Unless Europe takes it upon itself to uphold the essential balance on which the NTP is based, PrepCom 2007 may mark the beginning of the end for the Treaty.</p>

According to one, the biggest threat to the world was the unfavourable impact of high oil production on the stability of the Middle East, and the second referred to environmental factors and climate change. 11 September and Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that the source of the danger is identical: energy greed and excessive energy consumption. Ensuring that 20% of the energy we use is from renewable sources will not bring a complete solution; the only solution whereby we could see off both threats, cut emissions and reduce dependence on the unstable Middle East is nuclear energy. Let us confront the Greens with their now outdated arguments about the dangers of nuclear energy. We must not let them use the situation in Iran and elsewhere to hold us to ransom on the grounds of the possible misuse of nuclear energy. We have one instrument at our disposal to counteract this: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).</p>
<p class="contents">One positive result of the 2010 conference will be key security measures. In our view, the core issues are as follows: uranium enrichment and reprocessing pursuant to Article 4, including debates on regional nuclear fuel distribution centres; and secondly the need to find solutions to unauthorised withdrawals from Article 10 of the Treaty. We therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take the lead in negotiations at the preparatory committee in Vienna and make a substantial contribution towards a positive result in the 2010 conference. We also ask you for a implementation report on the 43 measures arising from the Council’s common position, which already applied to the unfortunate debate on the Treaty in 2005. We also urge the Member States to comply strictly with the tough wording of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions in relation to the NPT, and this includes banking operations and businesses in some southern European states. Commissioner, one final word, if I may. We must begin to look for a way of inviting Israel to negotiate the revision of the NPT. Please consult and work together with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have become even more aware of it in recent times because of the danger that fissile material and chemical or biological weapons might fall into terrorist hands.</p>
<p class="contents">This fear has resulted in strategic documents drawn up both by the European Union and by other international organisations. In particular, I would like to draw attention to the Comprehensive Political Guidance adopted by NATO at the end of last year. The nuclear aspirations of certain countries, notably North Korea and Iran, have also given rise to concern as was mentioned earlier. We are pleased to note that some progress has been made in the multilateral negotiations with North Korea and regret the lack of progress in the negotiations with Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that four conditions must be met if the very serious threat posed by proliferation is to be overcome. Firstly, the current non-proliferation regime in the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty must be maintained and perhaps even strengthened in 2010 on the occasion of the review conference. I endorse the call for the European Union Member States to speak with one voice at that conference. Their determination and cohesive approach are required.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important for the alliance between Europe and the United States to continue combating terrorism consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is important for the negotiations with North Korea to prove effective and to maintain the diplomatic approach to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, contrary to the opinions of certain Members on the Left, it is important to create an anti-missile shield that will defend not only the United States but also its European allies from strategic missile attacks. It is important for this shield to have an interoperative system protecting against short and medium-range missiles and for the system to be a joint one.</p>
<p class="contents">The TBMD project that NATO is to complete by 2010 is therefore of vital importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking our present situation as our starting point, we must address ourselves with greater energy to achieving, at this preparatory stage, a common position on the matters in which we, in 2005, perceived setbacks. I would like to make it clear that while it is not a matter of doubt that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has come under pressure from different sides, it does – if we take it seriously and have agreed on the 2005 Common Position – offer us a basis on which we can and must rely in the present preparatory conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly want to underline what so many of you, including Mr Schulz, have said about the importance of putting an emphasis on the multilateral approach, for we do, indeed, all know from experience that unilateralism gets us nowhere, that we need the multilateral approach, and that the more we demand it, the more necessary it becomes that we, within the European Union, should take up a common position in order to make progress on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">The path that the European Union has sketched out in relation to Iran is the right one in both political and diplomatic terms, and the offer reiterated by the Council a few weeks ago is the right one even though some are becoming impatient – not that there are many alternatives available. We have both – a resolution on security with the relevant sanctions, while, by the same token, the door to negotiations with Iran is still open.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise once more what I said at the outset about non-proliferation and disarmament. This issue must, in the interests of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, remain on the agenda, even though views may differ to some degree as regards the ways in which the dangers can be minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we should get support from your House for the forthcoming discussions, which are sure not to be straightforward. As for the exchange of information between Council and Parliament, and collaboration between them, I am able, on behalf of the Presidency to offer, firstly, a briefing for the relevant committee following the first session of the preparatory conference, and, secondly, a progress report detailing, by reference to the 43 points contained in a previous resolution, which of them have been achieved and which not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will study your recommendations very carefully, because the preparatory conference in Vienna gives us an important opportunity to better prepare for the 2010 conference and thus, hopefully, make up for a very difficult conference in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the seriousness and the importance of the situation as regards non-proliferation goes far beyond what is commonly known among our citizens. We conclude also from recent Eurobarometer surveys that our people want positive action. I agree with Mr Zappalà and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck when they say that the agreement on the importance of the link between weapons of mass destruction, proliferation and terrorism is necessary. This has to be stressed in the European security strategy, and it is being stressed, but we now have to implement it in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my conviction that the efforts of the European Parliament to promote coherence and more joint action are absolutely crucial. Everyone has mentioned that speaking with one voice is also crucial. Therefore, the Commission needs your valuable support to maximise its impact with regard to the common objective. Certainly, we will contribute to the work that will be done in Vienna because this will enhance our credibility, as many have said.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank Mr Pirker and Parliament’s delegation, particularly with regard to North Korea. I agree that North Korea is important not only in itself but also as a possible window of opportunity for progress elsewhere. However, we are still committed to never giving up as long as that is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In our headlines, we see the non-proliferation issues mostly referred to with reference to individual countries. However, let us not lose sight of the importance of the issue, as Mr Schulz has said, of the international system as a whole on the multilateral approach and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important four principles we should try to enhance again at the Preparatory Committee and then at the next review conference are as follows. Firstly, the question of the non-parties: I think there are three states which have so far refused to adhere to the treaty. Let us try to bring them in. Secondly, on the withdrawals in January 2003, the DPRK announced that it intended to withdraw from the NPT – it was the first state to do so. Several states believe that the DPRK is still legally bound by the treaty and has not followed the correct legal procedures to withdraw. Let us try to tackle this question on non-compliant parties. Some states which acceded to the NNWS have, nevertheless, sought to acquire nuclear weapons in the past and this, therefore, needs to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of good faith. It has been mentioned a lot around the table that most non-nuclear weapons states believe the nuclear weapons states have not done enough to make progress towards the goal of nuclear disarmament – Article 6. I think this should be the main bone of our contention at the five-yearly review conferences. We also see, therefore that a broad basis for a consensus is necessary, and all the big countries, like Russia and China, should be included in such a dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proliferation of nuclear weapons makes the world less, rather than more, safe. Whether Israel or India, Pakistan or North Korea, we should pressure them to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Yet we should recall that the NPT talks not only about stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, but about the world's nuclear powers reducing and removing their own capabilities. The former gets more attention than the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist amendment condemning the US anti-missile shield is all too appropriate. As we have seen in NE Asia, with Japan's deployment of Theatre Missile Defence and Theatre High Altitude Defence, these are enabling offensive technologies for the Bush Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive deterrence. With their deployment, the US will be able to launch an attack on countries with small numbers of nuclear weapons and defend against any orphan missile missed in the initial attack.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also be supporting Amendment 1 by the Greens. I am not in favour of unilateral abolition of Britain's Trident fleet, but I am entirely unconvinced of the need, at this stage, to renew it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents">The return to work after taking a break to have a family must be facilitated just as much as parallel working and childrearing for both parents, for it has been shown by a European comparative study that countries with a well-developed range of childcare options have overall a higher percentage of women going out to work, particularly where those women are the mothers of more than one child in need of care.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a particularly low birth rate where relatively few women go out to work, while highly-qualified women delay starting a family for a long time or do without children altogether. Whilst the average hours worked by men increases in line with the number of children they have, women who are also mothers reduce the number of hours they work, and that is why we, at Member State level, must endeavour to arrange things so that equality for women and men at work may improve and to get the conditions for them right.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because there is such a great need for action in this area that the German Presidency is the first since 2002 to make childcare one of its priorities, and one important step towards the improved provision of childcare places was taken as long ago as 2002, when the Heads of State and Government, at the Barcelona European Council, resolved that the Member States would have to achieve a minimum provision level by 2010, with childcare available for at least 90% of children between the age of three and the age at which they are required to begin school, and for at least one-third of all children under the age of three years. This target was, in 2003, incorporated into the European Employment Strategy and reiterated in the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Employment (2005-2008).</p>
<p class="contents">There are countries in which these quotas for provision have already been exceeded, in some cases by a considerable degree; for example, some seven Member States have achieved or exceeded the 33% quota set for childcare services for children under the age of three years, and it is already apparent not only that the other states are lagging behind, but also that the level of provision in some of them is blatantly low. The same can be said for the proportion of Member States that exceed or fail to meet the Barcelona target of 90% for children between three and school entry age.</p>
<p class="contents">What that means is that many Member States have to make much more of an effort in order to achieve the targets set at Barcelona. The 2006/2007 Joint Employment Report, which the Council adopted on 22 February – just a few weeks ago – enlarges on this point and is unambiguously critical of the slow progress where childcare is concerned. The lack of progress being made in child care could well have adverse effects on the attempts to raise the average percentage of women in work in the EU to at least 60%, which is another shared goal under the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that it is of the utmost importance that the European Council on 8/9 March confirmed the European Alliance for Families, which will inject renewed impetus into the achievement of the agreed goals for childcare and women in the workplace, and will also be the subject of discussion at the EPSCO Council on 30 May of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Alliance for Families helps to improve family-friendly living conditions in the European Union, and will create a platform for the exchange of opinions and information between the Member States. It is closely involved with the actual enforcement of equality, for improved balance of work and family life helps to improve equality of opportunity in the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been demonstrated that, if we are consistent in going down the road of improving conditions for young parents, of developing childcare and early-years education, of developing – hand in hand with the business sector – systematically family-friendly work structures, then we will be having a positive effect on the 2020-2030 period, the very period that is set to be particularly problematic in economic and demographic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of work/family compatibility presents challenges, however, not only to the state, but also to businesses. Children are our future; they are the workers, the consumers and the parents of tomorrow. Consideration of family concerns must become part of entrepreneurial strategy and of business culture; flexible working hours and models of part-time working – for both mothers and fathers – must become standard everywhere, and in this respect it would be helpful if it were to dawn on businesses that consideration of family concerns pays off in business terms, for mothers and fathers cannot give themselves completely to their work unless they know that their children are being looked after properly during the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Family-friendly attitudes at work also benefit the state and the social security agencies, for the more mothers and fathers are enabled to go out and earn money, the more taxes and social security contributions get paid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen, though, despite all this talk about the state and the economy, not to lose sight of the children, on whose well-being Europe ought to focus. Children need high-quality facilities in order to learn cognitive and social skills. Good and stimulating daycare for children is an important, necessary and valuable supplement to their upbringing in the family context, and that is what parents want. We must not be content with ‘care lite’.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why it is so important is that, in many states, the reality of the situation is that not all children’s interests are best fostered within the family, and that many children are growing up without siblings. Such children find in the crèche and the daycare provider a safe place, stable relationships and encouragement from various quarters to learn language and other skills. Studies all around the world have shown that children benefit from being supported and taught in a daycare facility or by a daytime carer.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that we will, with your support, benefit from new impetus in the areas I have named and that we have set in motion an important debate in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, five years have passed since the European Council set targets for pre-school childcare availability in the context of the European Employment Strategy. In March 2002, the European Council of Barcelona agreed that Member States should strive to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of all children between three years old and the mandatory age for starting school, and at least 33% of all children under three years of age, in an effort to remove disincentives to female labour participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council reiterated the need to achieve these targets in the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted in March 2006. These targets are a long way from being met, however. The provision of affordable, accessible and quality childcare is vital if Europe is to meet its agendas of growth, employment and gender equality. Childcare is needed to unleash the productive potential of the European workforce. It allows women and men with young children to enter and stay in paid employment, while improving their quality of life. It eliminates a major constraint that restricts the free choice of individuals to reconcile their professional and private lives. It also offers children an excellent start in life.</p>
<p class="contents">Accessible, high-quality childcare is a vital prerequisite to achieving genuine gender equality. Women continue to carry most of the responsibility for the care of children. At the same time, women are affected by the gender gaps that persist in employment, unemployment and pay. The provision of decent and widely accessible childcare contributes to the economic independence of women. It also gives single parents, most of whom are women, the opportunity to improve their living conditions. Childcare also contributes to addressing the demographic challenge of a falling birth rate, by supporting the individual choices of women and men, including decisions on the number of children they wish to have. If affordable, accessible and quality childcare is provided, having more children will not hinder labour market participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to supporting the achievement of the Barcelona goals. In last year’s roadmap for achieving equality between women and men in 2006-2010, the Commission committed itself to supporting the achievement of the Barcelona targets on childcare and the development of other care facilities through the Structural Funds and the exchange of good practice. The current rules for the Structural Funds already allowed for this use. In this context, the Commission pointed out that services and structures are adapting too slowly to a situation where both women and men work and where women continue to be regarded as the main carers of children and other dependants.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Barcelona targets is monitored in the framework of the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs. The Annual Progress Report in December noted that while there has been some progress in Member States to develop childcare facilities, progress towards the Barcelona targets remains slow. The Commission has therefore invited Member States to focus in 2007 on ‘increasing the availability and affordability of quality childcare in line with their own national targets’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Annual report on gender equality for 2006 published last month, the Commission pointed out that Member States should step up their efforts to meet the Barcelona targets and support the development of care for older and disabled persons. It also underlined the qualitative aspect of childcare and the fact that families and parents working on a full-time basis require appropriate opening hours and flexible access.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the establishment of an Alliance for Families, which was announced in the conclusions of the European Council. The ‘Alliance for Families’ will serve as a platform for the exchange of views and knowledge on family-friendly policies as well as of best practices between Member States. The Commission also invited Member States to make full use of the potential offered by the Cohesion Policy to support the promotion of equality between women and men, including improving access to affordable childcare, through programmes cofinanced by the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that childcare should be viewed as an essential part of a comprehensive approach to reconciling work and private life. Men should be encouraged to take an equal share of family responsibilities, in particular through incentives to take leave entitlements and by developing innovative and adaptable work patterns. The need for care services for school-age children and other dependant persons should also be addressed. I am pleased to announce today that I intend to submit, in 2008, a Communication on Childcare in which I will make concrete proposals to increase the availability, quality and affordability of childcare. We believe that this will be an important stimulus to Member States to meet the Barcelona targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I cannot hide my disappointment regarding the very mixed results obtained in the wake of the 2002 Barcelona Council. As the study by your Directorate-General for Employment concluded in September 2005, the insufficient number of affordable childcare structures represents not only a barrier to the economic and social integration of economically-disadvantaged families, but also, and above all, a major obstacle to the equal participation of women and men in the labour market and to the balanced division of tasks between women and men in family life.</p>
<p class="contents">It emerges from a very large number of studies that Europeans cannot have children, as they would like, or have as many children as they would like. Furthermore, given the way in which the needs and demands of the labour market have developed, the Member States should work towards establishing more flexible and more diverse childcare services so as to broaden the range of choices and to respond to the specific preferences, needs and circumstances of parents and families. There are people who wish to care for their children themselves; we cannot let these people down or penalise them since they are helping to maintain the social cohesion of the family unit.</p>
<p class="contents">As for those men and women who care for dependents on a permanent or temporary basis, they should receive a recognised status granting them, among other things, social security and pension rights, and, just like those who are gainfully employed, they should be able to benefit from lifelong learning so that they can fulfil the demands of the job market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of countries have achieved these already. Other countries are still a fair way from doing so, which is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Why is child care important, then? It is important for families with a view to their being able to combine family life and working life. It is important in terms of gender equality because it has traditionally been women who have had to accept responsibility for childcare and so have not entered the labour market. It is important for children to have access to high-quality childcare as an important stage in their progress towards, for example, school and the adult world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for employment and growth as, if we look at those countries that have made good progress in developing childcare, they also have high levels of employment, including women’s employment, and thus higher growth too. Looking at demographic development, we see the need to have women - indeed, everyone – in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The method we have is that of best practice. Many of the decisions are taken in the Member States, at local and regional levels. I have to say, however, how satisfactory it is that the debate has now been extended. I am following, for example, the debate in Germany, which is extremely lively in a way that it has not been in the past. It is important to have this ongoing debate in our Member States and for us to see the need for child care so that this development might get under way.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the German Presidency for having invited me, in my capacity as draftsman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the informal meeting taking place in May, when these issues are to be discussed. I am pleased to accept the invitation. We hope that we can make some headway in developing child care, for the sake not only of children and families but also of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Children and young people are the most valuable asset we have for our future. We have to make the sort of decisions that enable them to live a full and secure life, and these decisions need to be made now.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have been privileged in that, when my children were small, I was a house husband in Finland for five years. In our society there was the option of staying at home, and that is also true today. I can therefore state looking back that the five years I spent as a house husband looking after two boys were, without doubt, among the best years of my life.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that when we speak of parenthood today, we still conventionally try and place the burden of responsibility solely on the shoulders of mothers and women. Parenthood means that fathers too have to take full responsibility for their children. We also need to ensure that work and family life can be reconciled so that families can choose which of the parents goes out to work if it is impossible for both to do so. On the other hand, we should develop forms of day care so that children are provided with good, first-rate care if both parents are gainfully employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Childhood is an important time, as the data from research shows. The first four to five years in a child’s life are reflected in the rest of that child’s life. The decisions made then, the care and love received and the security that a child has felt will be conspicuous throughout a person’s life.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of these aims to try and promote the status of families and children. I hope that something concrete will come of them and that they will not merely remain aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This can only really happen if children are granted political rights. I refer to voting rights for children, rights to be granted to children and entrusted to their legal guardians, namely their parents.</p>
<p class="contents">An attempt to do just this has already been made in the German Parliament, the<span class="italic"> Bundestag</span>. The <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> debated a bill to grant voting rights to children from birth. The rights would be vested in the children’s parents and legal guardians. Of course, significant legal changes would be needed to bring this about, but it does seem that it would be more conducive to righting Europe’s demographic situation than the current legal arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it was because of the changes that the bill was rejected during debate in the <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>, even though it had the backing of many leading politicians and the support of the committee in which it had been discussed.

It means giving them not only the right, but also the opportunity, to work by making good, high-quality childcare available to them. Unless society helps all children have access to good childcare, with fair financial costs for the parents, and accepts responsibility for bringing about such a state of affairs, women will be forced to rely on others providing for them. As the Presidency did, I wish, however, to highlight children’s rights and the child’s perspective in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredibly important for children to be able to associate with other children, to meet with and otherwise encounter adults other than their parents and to have access to the educational experiences necessary to children’s development. Children who have the advantage of childcare involving both other children and adults trained as educators obtain a better start in life and increase their social skills. Good childcare is just as important, then, for children themselves as it is for gender equality and economic growth. I think that it is time for the EU institutions and, above all, the Member States to put at least as much commitment into children’s rights as they have hitherto put into the internal market for goods and services.

<p class="contents">It is important for a woman to have the right to pursue a career if she chooses and good, affordable childcare is essential in ensuring this.

<p class="contents">What is the debate about? It is important that we are honest. Is this debate about children? My first grandchild was born this morning. If we could ask him, he would say that he would choose to be cared for by his mother. Is the debate about choice for women? If it is, we would, on the one hand, financially support childcare and flexible working conditions for mothers who choose to work and, on the other hand, financially support mothers who choose to work at home caring for children.</p>
<p class="contents">If the debate is about the EU economy, then in the short term providing an extensive childcare system and a network of legislation that actually gets women into the workplace, whether or not they want to be there, makes sense. But in the long term, given EU demographics and the intricacies of child development, channelling the vast majority of mothers into the workplace during their children's young years is a policy that I am convinced we will someday regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Besides her desire to be an equal partner at work, a woman also longs to become a mother. The inadequate care that the state provides for children of pre-school age is one of the reasons why women are less likely to secure roles at decision-making levels. For that reason, specific targets were set in 2002 at the European Union summit in Barcelona. It was envisaged that by 2010 all Member States of the Union would ensure childcare for at least 90% of children aged from 3 to 6 years old, as well as for 33% of children under 3 years of age. It is generally known that at this age children grow and develop particularly rapidly, and therefore it is essential to make the best use of this time and to prepare them not only for school but also for life.</p>
<p class="contents">The attainment of these targets will facilitate the social integration of children from problematic population groups. The state should see to it that children from all social classes are given an equal opportunity to benefit from basic training for life, and to ensure that this opportunity is not determined by the wealth of their parents. Facing decreasing birth rates in Europe and ominous demographic statistics, we should take a moment to ponder why young families are not motivated to have children. We will all agree that a combination of short maternity leaves, taken immediately after a child is born, followed by part-time work and high quality child care facilities is the most effective mix possible. This will put the conditions in place for the healthy growth of the young generation and for the fulfilment of their parents’ ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we heard, not even a quarter of the Member States have achieved the targets. While in different Member States the situation apparently varies, in many of the new Member States it is deteriorating instead of improving. It would be a real shame if we were to continue to waste time and to declare in 2010 that the targets were illusory and unattainable, as there is no excuse for the lack of preparedness and in this particular case time is unforgiving.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that providing adequate childcare is one of the basic conditions for a better work-life balance. I am convinced that we cannot increase the employment of women and decrease unemployment among young people, which is very high indeed, without putting the conditions in place for proper childcare as well as care for dependant family members.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also sensible to demand that these services adapt to more flexible work patterns and better adapt to new requirements and changing conditions. It might be worth considering whether this area should not be included in the notion of flexicurity, because without flexibility and the adequate social security and legal certainty associated with these services, flexicurity is not feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">In expanding the network of these facilities the question arises as to who should assume not only the start-up costs but also the operational costs. There should be no doubt that responsibility rests with the Member States in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States should strive to provide childcare for at least 90% of children aged between three and the mandatory school age, and for 33% of children under the age of three, by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fifth anniversary of the Barcelona targets, we are here to evaluate the progress made in this area. Sadly, these targets have not yet been reached. Only five countries meet the 33% target: Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. We must look at how the other Member States are performing. I wonder if the Commission has been monitoring the situation regarding these targets. Is the Commission preparing an analysis? Are there common standards in order to monitor childcare? What are the consequences for those Member States not implementing the targets?</p>
<p class="contents">Why should Europe invest in childcare? It is not by chance that a childcare campaign was launched by the Party of European Socialists, who pleaded for accessible, affordable and good quality childcare. We did so because we strongly believe that investing in childcare means investing in our future; putting our children first gives them a good start in life and ensures equal opportunities when later entering the labour market. It allows the EU to deal with demographic challenges in order to make the EU market a more competitive one, as well as making Europe more social. It allows greater participation by women in the labour market and makes it possible for men and women to reconcile family and working life, as the Commissioner mentioned in his speech. Clearly, by investing in childcare, we can make equal opportunities a reality and maximise life’s opportunities for all children. This can contribute to the elimination of poverty, irrespective of the socioeconomic background.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I ask Member States and the Commission to work together and to commit to achieving these targets. Hungary is a good example: the Minister for Social and Legal Affairs recognised the importance of childcare and is committed to increasing childcare, particularly among children aged 0-3 years, from 8% to 33% in five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, at the same time they are also the most vulnerable, not just because of their sensitive somatic and psychological needs while growing up, but also because of the numerous perils encountered in modern living. For these reasons, amongst many others, our children unquestionably need and deserve our utmost care and attention. However, in a world in which both parents may be frantically fighting their way into a busy career rat race, a world in which both parents may be consumed in the daily fight of earning more, a world in which the forces of social strain may have destroyed family cohesion, a world in which geographical separation may have diminished the invaluable assistance of grandparents and other close family members – in such a world parental childcare may suffer severely.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the world that Member States must assist promptly and comprehensively. There should be encouragement of initiatives to create a greater number of and better-suited childcare services; provision for special leave flexibility for parents; and the establishment of working environments adapted to the needs of parents. These are just some of the main necessities. In addition, innovative measures should also be encouraged and improved upon, such as parent counselling services or even schooling for parents, whereby parents may be given greater knowledge and support on how to be better parents and how best to cope with the problems of parenthood.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us never forget that no childcare services, however good they may be, can replace parental love and affection. Along with all other measures, perhaps we should also encourage people to re-evaluate their priorities in life. Is it better for a family to have a higher income but less child-parent contact? Is it in the best interests of a family to have two full-time career-chasing parents who rarely meet up at the family dinner? Every parent should perhaps consider these questions and try to answer them honestly for their children’s sake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why is this? Do we not love children any more? That is certainly not the case. What has happened is that we have become more aware of the difficulty of bringing up children. Furthermore, women in Europe put off starting a family for longer and longer, if they actually decide to have children at all.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons for this situation is the provision of childcare during working hours. Women can only focus on their professional commitments if suitable childcare is provided.

If I have not misunderstood any of them, there is a great deal of agreement in this House as to the goal that we have set ourselves, which, indeed, we did a number of years ago, when we also accepted certain obligations. We have also seen that we have not yet succeeded in achieving these objectives in all the Member States, and that relatively little time remains to us to discharge those obligations before 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the debate on the Alliance for Families should be revived, and I will say quite deliberately that this needs to be done not only in Germany, as Mr Andersson said in the opening words of his speech. Different views were expressed on the particular subject of whether it might be made obligatory that children be put in childcare facilities, so what we are talking about is freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of choice is a very important thing to aim for. Nobody is stipulating in whose care children should be placed or how many children people have to have. That is not what we are here to debate. It has to be said, though, that there are special cases in which there is no such freedom of choice, because the specialised care facilities are not there, and that is why it is important, as has been said by the Commission, by you in your speeches and also by the presidency, to hold fast to this goal when there are so many different aspects to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have spoken about equality of opportunity, and others about the balance between work and family life, demographic change or children’s education. Something else that is important is that we have undertaken to increase the proportion of women at work, using flexicurity as one of the means to that end. It follows that diverse considerations have been taken into account in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate how very glad I was to hear Commissioner Špidla announce his intention of submitting a document next year in order to find out what will have resulted from the debates in the Council and in your House and what will have been done about achieving these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In thanking you for the frankness of this debate, let me also say that it is for every one of us, in any Member State in which the targets have not yet been met or in which there is a risk of them not being met by 2010, to take appropriate political steps in order that the goals we have set ourselves may – as we indeed hope – be achieved before that date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also no doubt that a number of countries are a long way from meeting the targets and that we must do all we can to encourage the Member States to rectify this.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages of the Barcelona Strategy are clear but I should like, if I may, to go over them once again. Firstly, without responsible childcare structures, it is not possible to achieve basic targets on gender equality. Secondly, without such arrangements the issue of demographic ageing cannot be addressed in a responsible manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Two questions clearly emerged from the debate: the first of which was whether the Commission has followed up the Barcelona Strategy. As I stressed in my report as part of the Lisbon Strategy, the answer is yes. The second question concerned measures with which to compare individual countries. Individual countries are currently compared on the basis of data that they give on an individual basis and, concerning methodology, it is difficult to compare these data. It is easy to monitor development in one’s own country but comparing one country with another is extremely difficult. This situation is unsatisfactory, and we are therefore working on ways of making the various individual viewpoints ready for assessment, which should be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also a third question that came through, which was whether or not, in the framework of the Barcelona Strategy, we are aiming for parental choice. Yes, in accordance with the objectives as they are formulated, this is clearly the case. The Member States should endeavour to provide childcare by 2010 for at least 90% of children from three years up to school age; that is, to provide care or to give parents the choice of whether or not to take up this opportunity. In this regard the purpose of the objective is abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate. I feel it is clear that there is still a great deal still to do, but that we are capable of accomplishing a great deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see this as our contribution to making every citizen safe and confident everywhere in the Union. I hope this House will give its support to this goal. This is also our contribution to increasing the economic wellbeing of our citizens and the competitiveness of the EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the importance of consumer policy to Parliament and welcome the support that has been given to consumer policy in the past. Your support for my nomination as Commissioner for Consumer Policy clearly indicated your expectations of the Commission, and I trust the strategy will be in line with your priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important for the consumer financial programme 2007-2013, in relation to which Parliament has been a key actor in the legislative process in terms of ensuring the smooth adoption of that programme? The programme is an important tool for the delivery of the strategy, and the changes made in the programme to take account of your views have also been factored into the strategy. The strategy and, indeed, my appointment as the first Commissioner for Consumer Affairs are the beginnings of a response to the vision of this Parliament. Some of you have been calling for a stronger consumer dimension to all EU policies for some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer policy seems to me to be equally well placed to tackle the two big challenges the EU faces today: boosting growth and jobs, and reconnecting with our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">On growth and jobs, it is clear that the internet is fundamentally changing the retail sector, but these changes have, in practice, so far been limited to national markets.</p>
<p class="contents">On the retail side of the internal market, we see fragmentation into 27 national mini-markets, and this is both a pity and a missed opportunity as the internal market has the potential to be the largest retail market in the world, with significant benefits to consumers and to the competitiveness of the EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up cross-border retail is the key to unlocking the full potential of the internal market. If cross-border shopping becomes a credible alternative to domestic shopping, then competitive pressure will increase, not only in cross-border shopping but also in domestic retail markets. The integration effect does not require all, or even most, consumers to do most of their shopping across borders. Our experience in removing obstacles to the cross-border sale of new vehicles shows that it is enough for cross-border shopping to be a credible alternative for competition to be enhanced in the domestic markets. This would be good for growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need a strategy that also responds directly to the aspirations of all our citizens. For them, an active consumer policy should be a central part of our efforts to show that they can improve their daily lives by taking advantage of opportunities created by Europe in terms of broader markets, lower prices and guaranteed rights and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting consumers at the heart of all EU policies and regulations is important. This is not just about a narrow consumer policy strip of European policy; the strategy commits us all, in Parliament as well as in the Commission, to look harder at all EU policies to be sure that we have properly taken account of the impact of consumers and have adjusted policies to maximise their benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso has therefore decided to expand the mandate of the competitiveness group of Commissioners to address the consumer dimension so that all proposals with a significant impact on consumers will in future undergo closer scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Under our consumer policy, we see three main objectives over the next seven years. First, I want to empower Europe’s consumers. This means creating the right market conditions for them to be able to make informed, considered and original choices and equipping them with the tools to do so. Second, I want to enhance the economic and non-economic welfare of Europe’s consumers in terms of price, choice, quality and affordability. Third, I want to protect consumers effectively. Market failures for consumers fall into two categories – those that individuals cannot address and those that they should address themselves. Consumer laws should effectively protect consumers from the former and equip them to deal with the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I want the Commission to be able to tell all EU citizens by 2013 that they can shop anywhere in the EU, from the corner shop to the website, confident that they are equally effectively protected and to be able to tell all retailers that they can sell anywhere on the basis of a single, simple set of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a long way from those goals now. Important progress has been made, with the help of the European Parliament: the directive on unfair commercial practices, the regulation on consumer protection cooperation and the network of European consumer centres have made significant progress. We need to complete this work and act on a number of fronts: better rules on contracts, better enforcement, information, advice and redress all need to work as well in the internal market as at home if consumers and SMEs are to be persuaded to make this leap.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonised rules in targeted areas are central to an integrated market – but not to keep lawyers and bureaucrats happy. A simple clear set of rules helps SMEs, consumers and enforcers, and I am not sure it is possible to encourage consumers and SMEs to see the EU market as a truly single territory without simple rules, but harmonised rules will not create this necessary increase in current levels of consumer confidence if harmonisation is agreed in a way that provides inadequate substantive levels of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">My preference is for harmonised rules and good protection. This Commission has recently launched an important consultation in this area and I welcome Parliament’s opinion on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in such a short time I can only give a brief flavour of the strategy. I think it sets out an ambitious agenda and on that we will require Parliament’s support in order for it to be successfully delivered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share the view of other Members of this House that it would be welcomed if you managed to place the consumer at the heart of internal market policy, because that would give the European project a fresh heart, and some will say a soul. We must see to it that we receive wide support from society for the integration projects we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, we are still waiting for concrete proposals, I mean the content of those proposals, because you have definitely compiled a list. Two things stand out, though. Firstly, with regard to legal remedies, which remedies do you have in mind to improve enforceability and retrieval recourse for the consumer compared to now? Secondly, maximum harmonisation is also something that intrigues me in connection with more uniform legislation. How do you think we could bring this about in practice?

I think that, in particular, Commissioner, you have clearly set out that EU consumer policy has to be at the heart of the whole internal market debate.

<p class="contents">Now the question I wanted to pose to you, Commissioner, is that you specifically identified your role as a champion for consumer issues and that you will be looking at other policies in other parts of the Commission. I think that, in particular, many of us are very concerned about the developing issues to do with the Rome Conventions, which, in some ways, may work against your vision of making a legal framework that is simple for SMEs.

<p class="contents">Where <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce is concerned, the European internal market must be a single market for consumers, for, if we are to put consumers in a more secure position within it, we will also achieve a greater volume of cross-border trade across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would like to raise. The first is that complete harmonisation of the kind you have proposed might well make perfect sense in certain fields – in <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, for example – but cannot be a model for the internal market as a whole, something for which good arguments still need to be found by way of a proper impact assessment.</p>

If you will allow me, I will pass on all these good wishes and congratulations to him. I can assure you that he fully deserves it. Anyway, thank you and I hope that on 22 June I can somehow be here at Parliament again to receive my fair share!</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with the questions. Mrs Pleštinská, it is really very important to for all our policies to be financially supported, and we will do our best to accommodate them within the framework of our budget. I believe that the most important thing for you is how you see the policy and how we can maximise what we have in terms of resources through our budget. This relates to education, information, European Consumer Centres and strengthening enforcement. We can think of many other ways of spending the money, but these are the priorities. In this respect, I am more than happy that you mentioned the EU diary. Just today, I distributed several copies during the meeting of the College of Commissioners as a reminder of how important it is as a tool. This will remain one of the best ways in which we can be in touch with the younger generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about the younger generation, I think that we what we have in mind about digital rights is very much in line with what they are looking for. The day after tomorrow, I have a meeting in Berlin on digital rights and I will specially address the younger members of the audience. In this way they could become more interested in what it means to be a consumer in this, our evolutionary world – Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">And now I come to Mrs Gebhardt’s question. It is always very important to have a precise policy and a precise vision about how we can use the framework directive, what kind it should be – because there can only be one – and what kind of sectoral influence we could pursue. I am in favour of this mixed approach. I am sure that this horizontal set of rules equally applied to typical consumer contracts and typical consumer rights, relating to enforcement or whatever – this is maybe not in the soul but in the core of consumer protection – is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">But we cannot exhaust all the sectoral problems. That is why I think we should also focus our attention very much on having sound performance in consumer protection, most importantly in energy, in transport and in telecommunications. That is why I think that being part of the Competitiveness Council is very important. Also, the competition Commissioner is a natural ally for consumer policy.</p>
<p class="contents">So, coming to Mrs Thyssen’s question about redress, I do not have in mind the United States type of class action. This is not a John Grisham story. We have another, European narrative, and this is much more related to collective redress. We have this collective redress in at least ten countries and, in one country, Holland, it is closer to a class action, but is still not the same. This is not the only collective redress. We can use alternative dispute resolutions, which are important, test cases and many other things. This is not about maximum harmonisation, but about bottlenecks – when and how we can identify them – and about focusing our attention on this in respect of the highest possible level of harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr Harbour, thank you for saying that I am trying to be a consumer champion. I would gladly share this role with any of my fellow Commissioners, because I dream of having a consumer champion from the other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Rome Convention, I think that through full harmonisation we can at least overcome some of the shortcomings of Rome I. Right now, as regards Rome I, businesses should comply with the rules of the country from which the problem originates, which does not significantly increase the burden on the business side.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have virtually answered Mr Schwab’s question about what kind of harmonisation we are targeting and about class action. I do not want to challenge the President’s patience by giving quite long answers, but I will be glad to continue this conversation with all of you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to ask you what you mean by the introduction of better redress procedures for consumers, since you told us that you do not envisage any collective redress.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that consumer rights are regularly violated <span class="italic">en masse</span> whether – in terms of the mobile telephone sector – these violations take the form of excessive prices, of deductions of unowed bank charges or of failings on the part of Internet access providers, and that, very often, individual losses do not amount to much but, when added together, represent significant collective losses, thus bringing extremely large sums into play.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with that, individual redress is ineffective and only class actions, in fact, may appear to be a satisfactory solution since they make it possible not only to provide consumers with a means of redress and a single form of compensation proceedings but also, and above all, to drive back businesses. This is what happens in Portugal, for example, and it does not involve any US-style excesses.</p>

<p class="contents">One: I think the paper provided by the Commissioner is a breath of fresh air. There is no false dichotomy between consumer policy on the one hand and the single market on the other and I think this is the first paper that brings it out fairly clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I really appreciate that the Commission is reinforcing the economic dimension of consumer policy because that has not been done previously and I think this is a very welcome step.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I have is about communication. I admit it. I will come out of the closet: I am a mega-shopper myself. I like shopping, but sometimes I do not do too well on the internet or something like that. So, my point to you is please communicate consumer policy better to the European citizens. People sitting around here do not know that the EU actually gives you a lot of rights when it comes to consumer policy.</p>

I believe that what is being done will be of great interest to many Europeans. However, my question to the Commissioner concerns what was said in the communication about the objective being that, irrespective of where in the EU trade is conducted, people should be protected in the same way. Perhaps I am alone in lacking a fully clear understanding of what is meant. Does the Commissioner want us to harmonise the rules so that the same rules apply throughout the EU, or are there to be minimum rules whereby certain countries may, if they so wish, have rules that go further? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Моят въпрос към Вас е как ще се справите с прекомерните, затормозяващи регулации, които се представят като защита на потребителите? И за да ме разберете добре, Ви давам конкретен пример от България. Законът за защита на потребителите забранява авансовото плащане при поръчка на стоки по интернет. Според текста на закона, доставчикът няма право да изисква или да приема плащане преди да изтекат седем работни дни от получаването на стоката от клиента или от сключването на договора.</p>
<p class="contents">Свръхрегулациите не са в полза нито на бизнеса, нито на потребителите. Подобни регулации спират много търговци въобще да доставят стоки в интернет. Това е точно пречка за малкия и среден бизнес. Смятате ли, че на европейско ниво трябва да се вземат мерки за решаването на този и на други такива случаи? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share the view of the coordinators in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Harbour, that the internal market must be attractive and that the consumer must be at the centre of it. As a free-marketeer, I see the market as encompassing supply and demand, but the question is who for? The consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I am worried, though, that our tactic in the past has been too paternalistic, overprotecting the consumer who is inundated with information and cannot see the wood for the trees. I rather like your style, the breath of fresh air, because you seem to be moving away from this paternalistic stance, and I hope – and am, indeed, confident – that the action plan will not prescribe additional restrictions and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question for you. Do you intend to investigate existing legislation to see whether it can be simplified, as a result of which the internal market can be attractive, and can remain so in future, especially with consumers in mind? After all, information is great, and so is freedom of choice, but we must not inundate people with information and we must not patronise them either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My second point concerns unfair commercial promotions. As you mentioned, we did some very good work during the last parliamentary term, but, unfortunately, some unfair competition is actually protected by consumer protection rules in Member States.

<p class="contents">My second point involves class acts or representative action – which does already exist in Member States. There is already a representative action taking place in the UK taken out by the ‘Which?’ consumer group against JBB Sports relating to the sale of England and Manchester United football shirts in 2000 and 2001 using what is called Section 47b of the UK Enterprise Act of 2002.

As I said, last week we launched a study on collective redress, and once we have received all the results, we will present them and discuss the outcome with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no doubt that the collective interest of consumers, in a case such as the small-scale complaint that you mentioned, is very important for ensuring the fairness of the market and also for shaping the market behaviour of producers. We will therefore pursue our efforts in this area, which concerns precisely the first and third pillars of our consumer policy – to empower the consumer and to protect the consumer, not in a paternalistic way, but quite the opposite. This means that we will need more active citizens and more tools available for them.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Stubb's question about priorities, the competitiveness commissioners will start to systematically review policy initiatives to ensure consumer outcomes are given greater weight. This concerns the information society, the digital world, energy liberalisation and trade instruments. The first initiatives are in our work programme. I believe that once this is done, if I may borrow from one of Mr Stubb's articles, we will be able to say that Europe is becoming more 'cool' and easier to understand for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question by Mrs Schaldemose on <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rules, I do not think we can label the rules as minimalist or as maximalist. We need a certain amount of very well measured regulation, precisely implemented, and I do not believe that de minimis rules would always be helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the question by Mr Dimitrov. Allow me to switch into Bulgarian. </p>
<p class="contents">Г-н Димитров, Вие представихте това, което считат за правилно провайдърите на такъв тип услуги. Вие буквално прочетохте тяхното писмо, с което аз съм запозната отдавна. Но аз имам и друго писмо и това е от гледна точка на потребителските организации.</p>
<p class="contents">В събота, в София, аз ще участвам в една конференция, която е специално насочена към тези права онлайн. И се надявам, че тогава ще могат да се чуят и двете страни. В противен случай, от тук да коментираме чл. 56 на националното ни законодателство, не е може би най-доброто време за това. Но мога да Ви уверя, че цялото внимание ще бъде отдадено на това да има повече информация и да могат да се видят различните гледни точки. </p>
<p class="contents"> Then, the impact assessment and cross-border problems – how the new approach could go in the right direction: I think this is exactly what the new approach is targeting, but, unfortunately, I do not have a recipe as to how we can avoid any trouble and make implementation go smoothly. This very much depends on the individual country. The only way I know is to communicate more, to explain more and to rely on the European Consumer Centres, on enforcement bodies in the Member States and on consumer organisations. That is why I believe that adding a strong consumer dimension to Member State governments’ policies and to non-governmental organisations is absolutely crucial for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding tangible penalties: if there is an infringement I will not hesitate to start such a procedure, but first let us think how better to implement and to enforce, and then, if necessary, we can go further.</p>
<p class="contents">On the last question about Microsoft: frankly, I do not think that I have enough information to speculate on this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the young generation, I could not agree more that this is one of the Commission’s main targets. I very much appreciate the approach taken by my colleague Commissioner Kyprianou on the health programme, and I think that it would be useful if we had the same approach on the consumer side targeting the young generation. We should really educate and teach the young generation of consumers – somebody called them ‘digital natives’! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question by the honourable Member is whether the Commission has a full picture of emissions of greenhouse gases from road transport and what measures it proposes to reduce the effect on the environment of these emissions. The Commission services, in cooperation with the European Environmental Bureau, records and monitors annual emissions from all domestic means of transport in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall comment first on emissions of carbon dioxide, to which the honourable Member's question refers. In 2003, emissions of carbon dioxide from the transport sector in the European Union of the 25 totalled 951 million tonnes, accounting for approximately 21% of all emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union. Road transport generated emissions of 892 million tonnes of carbon dioxide; in other words, road transport accounts for the biggest share of emissions of greenhouse gases within the European Union. From these statistics, which refer to all forms of transport within the European Union, we need to distinguish international aviation. Aviation can be divided into domestic flights and international flights. As far as international flights are concerned, the production of carbon dioxide is 112 million tonnes more than the amounts I referred to earlier. I should also point out that emissions by aeroplanes have spiralled in comparison with emissions by other means of transport. Finally, the effect on the climate from aeroplanes is greater than the statistics show, because at high altitudes emissions from aeroplanes affect the ozone, which is a greenhouse gas, and affect cloud formation. That is why, if we want to limit the effects on the climate from transport, we need to take action which covers all means of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards road transport, the Commission has already notified its intention to propose a legislative framework to limit emissions of carbon dioxide from cars and vans in its communication on carbon dioxide and cars. Average emissions from new automobiles marketed within the European Union must be limited to 120 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilometre by 2012. Improvements to engine and automobile technology will bring about a reduction in emissions to 130 grammes per kilometre, while supplementary measures will bring about a further reduction of 10 grammes per kilometre.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, the Commission has tabled a proposal to revise the directive on the fuel quality. The proposal for a directive makes provision for an obligation for fuel manufacturers to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from fuels over their life cycle. This endeavour will bring about a 10% reduction in emissions from road transport by 2020. To get an idea, over a period of 10 years, the reduction in emissions will be equivalent to current annual emissions by Spain and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">So far I have commented on emissions of carbon dioxide from road transport. As far as aviation is concerned, the Commission has tabled a proposal for them to be included in the European Union's emissions trading system. Our proposal has been brought before Parliament. Apart from carbon dioxide, transport produces other emissions which affect the environment and human health, such as suspended particles and emissions which help to create ozone, such as nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds. Within the framework of the CAFE programme, we estimate that, if no further measures are taken up to 2020, transport as a whole will account for 51% of nitrogen dioxide in terrestrial emissions and 20% of PM 2.5 suspended particles. That is why the Commission is proposing restrictions on emission limits for automobiles and an agreement was reached last December on the EURO 5 and EURO 6 standards. The Commission also intends to table a proposal to introduce new EURO 6 standards for heavy goods vehicles during this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think most Members will welcome the 130 grammes per kilometre figure. Of course MEPs including myself will want to see better targets, more effective targets. There is no question of that, but the reason for my question was first of all to reflect the action that you have already taken and that Parliament wants to see taken, but also to get into balance the fact that there are emissions from homes, from waste and all sorts of other areas other than just aircraft and that the Commission, working with Parliament, emphasises that this is a partnership across all of the deleterious effects of CO2 emissions so that we do not just emphasise air flights and then just miss out the emissions of shipping and vehicles. In my own city of London that is extremely important to stop the kind of pollution that we see strangling that city. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with you that we should not focus solely on emissions from airlines, although airlines contribute 3% of the carbon dioxide produced in the European Union and have additional effects because of vapours and nitrogen oxides, because these emissions are occurring at a very high altitude, and because the increase from 1990-2004 was 87% and is still rising. Of course, other sources of carbon dioxide like shipping contribute more in total to EU carbon emissions, but they are not increasing as fast. Furthermore, if we calculate the transport unit per tonne of carbon dioxide, then we see that they contribute less than aviation. You quite rightly mention other sources such as homes. I can go further and mention landfills, F gases, or agriculture: all these are sources of carbon dioxide and the Commission is taking measures to address these particular issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the legislation on car emissions, with the target of 120 grammes. This is to be achieved by engine modifications and improvements up to 130 grammes, with an additional 10 grammes to be achieved by component improvements and biofuels. Biofuels will also be very important for land transport, especially with the amendment of the fuel quality directive, which will not only promote sustainable biofuels but also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. This will be accompanied by a series of other measures adopted with your help and cooperation and aimed at effectively fighting climate change, which is the number one problem in the world today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, Commissioner, London is already failing to meet EU air quality targets on NOx and particulates, and it is forecast to exceed the more stringent levels coming down the track. Increasing use of public transport is essential to cleaning up London’s air, but we are the most expensive public transport capital in the world. Monthly fares for commuters are twice those in Paris and Rome. What role might the EU play in improving air quality in London, not least by enforcement action and encouraging the Mayor of London and the UK Government to make public transport more affordable? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that in London there are additional measures. Actually, very recently there was an expansion of the congestion charge zone, so the local authorities are taking the measures they think appropriate in order to fight climate change, by reducing carbon dioxide and the various pollutants emitted by passenger cars. But you are absolutely right, the better the public transport is, the better it is for the environment, especially if the means of public transport, such as buses, are using sustainable fuel. I think that the introduction of Euro 5 and Euro 6 will be of great importance for London, as it will be for other cities in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have calculated in terms of the contribution of passenger cars towards our quota target, which is 0.8 % of the 8 % target, will be achieved, but, of course, in a slightly different way. We have 130 g/km delivered by improvements in car engines and an additional reduction of 10 g through the manufacture of car components and biofuels. We have therefore left the environmental benefit the same, so, as Commissioner for the Environment, I can assure you that I am very happy with it. Of course, there is a difference: some of the burden is shifted from car manufacturers to car component manufacturers and to biofuels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the1990s, the Commission organised pilot programmes in a bid to promote environmental education in schools. This endeavour included both support for programmes relating to specific environmental issues and the preparation of study programmes. Numerous Member States have now included environmental education in their national curricula. The Commission has also developed means of communication and initiative for the environment which constitute an important source for school programmes and for young people in general. For example, the website of the Environment Directorate General entitled ‘Environment for Young Europeans’ offers young people information on the environment in 20 languages. This website is interactive and analyses environmental problems in a simple, amusing and educational manner. More importantly, it shows children ways in which they can protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Schools play a fundamental role in the Commission's strategy to increase awareness, the strategy entitled ‘Climate change depends on you’ which started in May 2006. Schools taking part in this strategy must record and monitor their efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and declare their commitment to fighting climate change. The strategy website contains a wealth of material and is directed at young people.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, many of our publications are directed at young people. Children's books cover various environmental issues, such as the spiralling increase in waste, the destruction of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and climate change, the importance of preventing river pollution and the importance of biodiversity. Other publications include a collection of sketches and stories by children and an educational leaflet on the Natura 2000 network. I have copies of these publications in various languages, as well as of a video of the Commission ‘Climate change depends on you’ strategy presented by the MTV television channel. It is a USB video and any Members of Parliament interested may take a copy. I also have a number of leaflets over there. I should also like to point out that educational programmes on the environment are eligible for funding on the basis of the action programme in the lifelong learning sector for 2007-2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the specific question of whether schools in the European Union will include programmes proposed by the European Union in their curricula, there was a major debate on this issue in the late nineties, when it was decided that the matter should be governed by subsidiarity and was for Member States to determine.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can do more because environmental awareness is of extreme importance. You can see what is happening with climate change, now that people around the world and in the European Union have become more aware of the threat it poses, because of newspapers and the media, and the reports available on the subject, such as the Turner Report, the IPCC report, and various reports by other scientific organisations like NASA, and because of the work done by the European Parliament, by the Commission and the European Union. As a result we have been able to introduce various measures and to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s historic agreement on the energy and climate change package will give us not only a leading position in the world in fighting climate change, but, most importantly of all, will enable us to be more effective in persuading other countries to come on board after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Children are very important, not only because, as you said, they develop good habits, but also because they influence their parents. So it is really a very good investment to make children more aware of environmental issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The same observation applies to the Bologna process, as a whole, even though that process developed outside the Community framework.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, with regard to the recognition of degrees awarded in the other Member States, the Commission would refer to the provisions of Article 149 of the Treaty, which stipulate that the organisation of the education system falls within the competence of the Member States. This recognition is governed by the national law of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission would point out that a degree recognition information network – NARIC – which has offices in every Member State, has been set up with the help of the European Union. Interested citizens can go to these offices to obtain reliable information on the nature and value of the degrees awarded by every European university.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on 5 September 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal for a recommendation establishing the European qualification framework (EQF).

<p class="contents">As from 10 June, a new commercial service will be implemented between France and Germany following the opening of 300 kilometres of new high-speed lines between Paris and Baudrecourt in the Lorraine region. This section is part of this priority project. The line will be opened on Thursday 15 March.</p>
<p class="contents">The new commercial service will provide for four daily return journeys between Paris and Stuttgart, starting 10 June 2007. This service will be extended to Munich when the new timetables are introduced in early December 2007. This service will run on the existing line between Stuttgart and Munich.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission is closely monitoring the modernisation of the sections between Stuttgart and Ulm. In July 2005, it appointed Peter Balazs as the European coordinator for this line, who submitted an initial progress report published on 13 September 2006. The coordinator is giving special priority to the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck, which absolutely must be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is already cofinancing the sections between Augsbourg and Munich, the entry into service of which is scheduled partly for 2008 and partly for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to you, Mr Posselt, that the coordinator and the Commission are paying very close attention to the studies and the construction of the line between Strasbourg, Kehl and Appenweyer – the interconnection of the French and German networks with the Kehl Bridge, for which we have been waiting for so many years. I am fairly optimistic. I believe that we are well under way on this and that this project, which Mr Balazs is monitoring extremely closely, is on the right track, if I can use the expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I should like to ask what is going to be done in future about the laying down of TEN routes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its answer to my previous question (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-5051_EN.html">E-5051/06</a>), the Commission states that: 'all monies due to Olympic Airways up to 2002 were taken into consideration by the 2002 Decision ...'. This Decision, in conjunction with that of the Court of Arbitration which awarded the sum of € 580 million to Olympic Airways in compensation for a part only of the State's debts to the company and the debts entered in Olympic Airways' accounts, is embarrassing to the Commission, since for many years successive governments saddled Olympic Airways with vast debts which they refused to recognise while the European Union 'washed its hands of the whole business', and pretended to take the information provided by successive governments at face value. Given that unresolved issues with the European Union are preventing the company from undertaking investments which are essential for carrying out its work as air carrier, will the Commission say whether it intends to clarify its claims that the real debts of the Greek State to Olympic Airways have already been offset during the implementation of restructuring programmes? What initiatives does it intend to take to oppose the demand for the recovery of 'aid' which has been taken into account following the judicial decision?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must emphasise this point; there is no reason, in actual fact, not to treat this matter with the utmost rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Statements have certainly been made in the press regarding the previous decisions, and those statements were challenging the validity of these decisions, even though they had been taken following in-depth investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission treats Greece in the same way that it treats every other Member State, and the Olympic Airways carrier should be treated in the same way as every other airline. By Commission decision of December 2002, Greece was forced to recover the amount of aid identified in the decision, something that it has not done. A further negative decision of September 2005 concluded that additional aid had been granted to Olympic Airways. Since no other recovery measure has been taken by Greece since then, the Commission has been obliged to start legal proceedings against Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Greek authorities fulfil their obligations, this action will not be pursued. Unfortunately, the financial problems facing Olympic Airways are not isolated and they are not the consequence of the Commission’s actions, and definitely not the consequence of the procedure brought before the Court.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Cooperation in the transport sector with neighbouring countries and, in particular, the Mediterranean region</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 31 January 2007, the Commission adopted a communication entitled 'Guidelines for transport in Europe and neighbouring regions', setting out the basic strategic guidelines for a revision of the pan-European zones and 'corridors', together with the five basic axes linking the EU with its neighbours, in the light of the new geopolitical conditions, particularly following the latest enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that, of the thirty priority projects for trans-European networks, these five basic axes should take precedence? In particular, three of the five basic axes concern the Mediterranean [(a) motorways of the seas in the Mediterranean region, (b) south-eastern axis EU-Balkans-Turkey-Middle East-Egypt, Red Sea and (c) south-western axis, EU-Maghreb countries-Egypt].</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to present specific initiatives to support the priority projects in relation to these three basic axes concerning the Mediterranean? As of 2007, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will contribute towards the financial support for neighbouring countries in the form of loans for projects in priority sectors and for horizontal measures. Can the Commission say what level of funding is envisaged from the Instrument and what part will cover the needs of the Mediterranean? In addition to the involvement of European and international financial instruments, what is the contribution of the partner countries in this regard?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2004, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a decision that changed the guidelines for the trans-European network for the territory of the European Union of 27. This policy concentrates investments on 30 axes and transnational priority projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Mrs Kratsa, the trans-European transport network (RTE) budget amounts to EUR 8 billion and with this amount it will not be possible to cofinance all the priority projects in their entirety. Therefore, it will be necessary to concentrate the budget on cross-border sections and bottlenecks, that is, the projects that produce the highest European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the document identifies five major axes that link the European Union to its neighbours. These five axes do not alter the priorities fixed by the European transport networks within the European Union. The document is in keeping with the European Neighbourhood Policy. This policy was designed to avoid causing splits between the European Union and its neighbours, whether in the context of membership or in relation to closer cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Euro-Mediterranean cooperation within the transport sector has been identified, from the beginning of the Barcelona process, as one of the priorities for cooperation in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is dependent upon the Euro-Mediterranean transport forum and its working parties. Currently, a budget envelope in the region of EUR 200 million has been allocated for financing actions developed in the context of Euro-Med Transport cooperation. It is mainly about pre-feasibility studies for 10 infrastructure projects on the priority axes for Euro-Mediterranean transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The total cost of the projects proposed within the context of Mediterranean cooperation amounts to EUR 23 billion by 2020 for the Mediterranean region. Of course, national budget appropriations are still essential for the transport sector, in particular for the maintenance of the existing network but also for critical investments, especially at cross-border level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community will continue to support these actions as in the past, by means of technical assistance and by assistance in improving administrative capacity. In certain instances, support may include investment for critical infrastructures, especially cross-border, or key horizontal measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to remind you that the European Investment Bank’s new mandates provide a Community guarantee that should allow that Bank to grant up to EUR 8.7 billion in loans during the period 2007-2013 to Mediterranean countries. I repeat, EUR 8.7 billion in loans! That is no small sum.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, most of the national indicative programmes already make provision for interest rate subsidies in order to make it easier for the European Investment Bank, or other development banks, to grant loans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends also to put in place an investment fund of EUR 700 million in donations for the European Neighbourhood Policy for the period 2007-2013. This fund will make it possible to back the loans granted by the European Investment Bank and other European development banks, especially in the transport, energy and environment sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This close collaboration between the Commission and the European Investment Bank and the other sponsors must be reinforced in the regional context as well as in the global context. Public-private partnerships are a promising tool for the realisation of infrastructure projects that are profitable from economic, social and environmental points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement the package proposed in the communication, the Commission will opt for an approach by stages that is intended to reinforce the framework for cooperation between the European Union and the neighbouring countries. From 2007, the Commission is to start preliminary discussions with the neighbouring countries in order to define with them coordination frameworks that are structured and effective and which should allow the active, synchronised implementation of measures along the axes. I hope that, following these discussions, the Commission will make a concrete proposal. I hope also to be able to present a report at the halfway stage in the autumn of 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It recognises that a key issue is the development and deployment of processes that can supply the required quantities of hydrogen in a way that leads to a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and which is also environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, the bulk of hydrogen is expected to come from fossil fuels, firstly without, and then, in the medium term, with carbon capture and sequestration. The long-term goal is to produce hydrogen from carbon-free and carbon-lean energy sources. Under the fifth and sixth framework programmes, projects have investigated the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier at the global level, as well as looking at many different options for producing and using hydrogen, while analysing the economic, social and environmental opinions for different pathways. Under FP 6, EC funding for hydrogen and fuel cell research and demonstration exceeds EUR 300 million. Around 20% of the activity concerns hydrogen production covering short-term pathways, such as advanced electrolysers, as well as long-term technologies, such as biological and photo-electrochemical processes. Technical research is complemented by socio-economic studies and demonstration.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to give you some practical examples. Under the fifth framework programme, the Commission supported the CUTE and ECTOS programme, which demonstrated 30 hydrogen fuel cell buses and hydrogen infrastructure in ten European cities and contributed to establishing its credibility as an alternative to petrol and diesel. Under FP6, these activities have further expanded into a demonstration of a fleet of 200 hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, including buses, cars and small specialist vehicles, as part of the Hydrogen for Transport initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">A further example of a project financed under the sixth framework programme, and whose results were just recently published, is the hydrogen internal combustion engine project. This is a new type of hydrogen technology that will lead to new and more efficient engines. The project has tested ways to make hydrogen-fuelled engines that are as efficient as current diesel engines, yet not polluting and with little or no trade-off in terms of engine size and power. These hydrogen-fuelled engines offer clear advantages over current generation engines and promise to compete with other proposed systems in terms of performance as well as cost. Under this project, innovative fuel injection concepts for engines for passenger cars, as well as for trucks and buses, were developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me give you another example, worth mentioning because it was awarded the Descartes prize for collaborative scientific research just last week. It is the Hydrosol project, an innovative solar thermo-chemical reactor for the production of hydrogen from water-splitting, resembling the familiar catalytic converter of automobiles. The integration of solar energy with systems capable of splitting water will have an immense impact on energy economics worldwide, as it is a promising route for providing affordable renewable solar hydrogen with virtually zero CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course many more such examples and if the honourable Member wishes, I can provide her with a list of projects. Under the current seventh framework programme, which was launched just recently, research and technological development and demonstration in the field of hydrogen and fuel cells will benefit from very extensive stakeholder consultation undertaken through the European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform. Established in the year 2004, this industry-led technology platform has provided the strategic direction which the sector needs in order to bring these technologies to the point of commercial readiness.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex 4 to the Council decision on specific programme cooperation lists a hydrogen and fuel cells initiative as one of the possible joint technology initiatives that may be established either on the basis of Article 171 of the Treaty — this may include the creation of joint undertakings — or on the basis of a modification of the specific programme in accordance with Article 166 of the Treaty. The JTI, envisaged as a long term public-private partnership, will define and execute a target-oriented European programme of industrial research, technological development and demonstration designed to deliver robust hydrogen and fuel cell technologies developed to the point of commercial take-off. It is expected that one of the JTI targets will be to supply 10 to 20% of the hydrogen demand for energy applications with carbon-lean or carbon-free production technologies by 2015. The precise scope and targets will be defined once this joint technology initiative is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the first calls for proposals for FP7 were launched on 22 December and the expiry date is the end of April. The energy theme includes a number of topics related to innovative materials for specific hydrogen production pathways.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken longer than I intended, but I wanted to give you a broad outline of the programmes or initiatives which are in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By placing more emphasis on the European technology platform, which is dealing with this question, we now have a strategic and coherent approach on how to proceed. All countries around the world are still dealing with major questions and this means putting current discoveries on the market, which would lead to a true hydrogen economy. However, I think we can be very proud of what we have achieved in the past and of how we are handling the issue at present.

<p class="contents">Under a coherent strategy designed to devote 3% of the EU’s GDP to research by 2010, 8 out of every 1000 people of working age in Europe would need to be researchers – that means a total of 700 000 new, properly trained researchers. It is therefore vital that Europe make the most of its research potential, inter alia by encouraging more women to get involved in science and technology. Using only half of the brains available is neither intelligent nor efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">International Women’s Day is on 8 March. In view of this, can the Commission come forward with an initiative designed to put this fault right?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest available statistics show that, in all disciplines, over 50% of graduates, but only 15% of professors, are female. In science, engineering and technology, the figures are 34% for female graduates and 9% for female professors respectively. The Commission agrees that this is a waste of talent and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1999, several documents by the Commission have addressed the participation of women in European research. The Commission is devoted to gathering reliable statistical data in order to view the complete situation and it publishes these results regularly in a brochure entitled ‘She Figures’. This brochure was published in 2003 and 2006, and the next publication is expected in 2009. Since the Fifth Framework Programme, the Commission has also provided financial support to studies and action in the field of women in science. In addition, under the Sixth Framework Programme, a budget of EUR 15.7 million has been devoted to women in science. Several projects are ongoing: addressing the need to provide role models to encourage women to pursue a career in science, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2005 Competitiveness Council conclusions led Member States to set a goal of 25% of women in leading positions in the public sector. In this regard, an expert group on women in research decision-making has begun to look at the formal and informal barriers which make it difficult for women to reach top-level positions in research. Under the new framework programme, a similar expert group will look at the issue of scientific excellence and potential gender bias in the evaluation of scientific excellence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Seventh Framework Programme, the line of action with regard to gender issues is divided into three main areas of activity. Firstly, in order to strengthen the role of women in scientific research, we will finance projects to compare positive action schemes for women in research decision-making positions, which will cover Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, under gender dimension of research, the areas of action in the Seventh Framework Programme will include gender issues as regards the definition and measurement of scientific excellence. For instance, an analysis of all research carried out in the EU on issues of discrimination and disadvantages for female researchers will be financed through this type of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, as regards mainstreaming gender in Community research policy and programmes, work programmes under the cooperation-specific programme encourage female participation. The Commission also continues to have a target of 40% of females on evaluation panels and this is monitored regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have planned to provide training and guidance to various researchers on how to mainstream gender in research.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever we do in the Seventh Framework Programme, it is and will be an important policy statement and will also be important for a number of research organisations who participate in the framework programme. We will have only a limited impact on the situation on the ground in Europe. Thus, we are also looking for new ideas on which the Commission could take action or Member States could take action with the support of the Commission. Therefore we intend to make this a question in its own right in the ERA green paper. The more the specific situation and needs of researchers in Europe are recognised, with regard to mobility or portability of social security rights for example, the more scope there could be for addressing the specific role of women in research. The ERA green paper will soon be discussed by the Commission and I would like to invite Members to actively participate in the ERA debate which ensues. Furthermore, I am relying on your strong support on this and other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that we have opted for a long-term approach based on constant efforts and continuous support in promoting the role of women in the world of science, using the measures and activities I have just explained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your proposals appear to me to be highly appropriate. As you have said, the point is that Europe must exploit its research potential as much as it possibly can, and to that end, women of excellence must have the same opportunities as men of excellence. In practice, that does not always happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask you to what extent the Commission — while ensuring that excellence remains the main criterion, of course — could also take account, as it has done on other occasions, of the gender balance when it comes to evaluating projects, or take account of the fact that these projects are led by women.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is whether you are going to take measures to ensure that the membership of programme committees, high-level groups, working groups, etc. is balanced from a gender point of view and to ensure the same thing in all other activities financed by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The work programmes will encourage women’s participation in research and highlight the relevance of gender in specific topics. Large projects will have the possibility and will be encouraged to include gender equality actions in their projects, and these will be reimbursable actions, just like other activities in the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to repeat that we should and we will give a positive example, but we are all aware that we cannot solve the problem without looking beyond the research portfolio. We are now facing difficulties that are part of a broader picture of reality in a society resulting in this unfavourable and unfair situation in which we are not using all of our knowledge potential. That is why I believe that the debate we will be having and which will specifically focus also on this issue is so crucially important.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning how we are trying to be practical, I can give you an example of how we address the question of evaluation panels, in which we have a target for 40% participation by women. Article 17 of the rules of participation in the seventh framework programme specifies that in the selection of independent experts, we should ensure reasonable gender balance. Women’s participation in evaluation panels has increased since the Commission set that target in 1999. It went up from 22% in 1999 to 30% in 2005. Unfortunately, I still do not have the figure for 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare this with the proportion of women in our expert database, which is only 25%, that will give you a clear sign that we are trying to do our best. On top of that, the Commission encourages female experts to register on our database. The European platform of women scientists created at the end of 2005 will help us in this respect. Those are the things we intend to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mobility of people is crucial for the success of research carried out in Europe or in any part of the world, because the fertilisation of minds is achieved through the mobility of minds. Of course nobody prefers having people educated in his own country – at least to secondary school level – who then leave and live outside their countries. If that happens, clearly we must establish close links with the people who are living outside our countries, for example in the United States. We have a special programme in FP7 which is doing exactly that. So creating networks with the people outside, so that they are not actually lost, is of extreme importance.</p>
<p class="contents">But still, the brain drain is a question which we have to address very seriously. In Europe recent data is not too alarming. Of course there are differences between the Member States, but in many of the countries, many very well-established universities are reporting that there is also a huge influx of students into the European Union. I recently visited India, and learned that 17 000 students come from India to the United Kingdom every year to study on European soil. I think that kind of flow is good and important, and we have to promote it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, brain drain is of course another issue. We have to pay attention, to it, but there are many reasons behind it, for example the attractiveness of the career, social portability, pension rights, many of the things which are interconnected. There is no simple answer to that type of question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore keeping a very close watch on this problem, and I do not wish to conceal from you my extremely serious concern about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has devised a general strategy against the counterfeiting of medicinal products in the European Union and has ensured – in view of the problem’s international ramifications – that it is used to work in harness with, and complement the work of, such international partners as the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community legal framework that permits the authorities to confiscate counterfeit medicinal products brought onto the Community market or found on it consists of Community legislation on medicinal products, on customs action, and on the enforcement of intellectual property rights. It is the Member States that are primarily responsible for the enforcement of the existing regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past five years, they have uncovered, on the EU market, 27 cases of counterfeit medicinal products in the legal supply chain and 170 on the black market, and, while that may not seem to constitute a vast amount, it is evident not least from the seizure, by Customs officials, of counterfeit medicinal products on our external borders that there has been a marked increase in them over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics for 2005 show that Customs officials seized 560 000 counterfeit medicinal products at the EU’s external borders in that year, and an initial analysis of the Member States’ figures for 2006 has shown that the number of counterfeit medicinal products seized by Customs in that year can be expected to total over 1.5 million, which amounts to a dramatic increase.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on how Customs might respond to the most recent developments in the counterfeiting and piracy of goods and products, the Commission put forward an action plan containing a series of concrete measures whereby this increase can be combated.</p>
<p class="contents">A start has already been made on two of the most important of these measures, namely the creation of an electronic system for the speedy exchange of information between customs authorities on risks of new kinds of counterfeiting and the establishment of a system through which businesses can submit to the customs authorities, as rapidly as possible, information that they need on counterfeits in order to be able to take action against them. The Commission also, in March 2006, sought to raise public awareness of this problem by warning of the availability of counterfeit medicinal products on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">In this warning message, the Commission publicly announced that it would be running a project to analyse the situation and would, in collaboration with the Member States, the European Medicines Agency and international partners, be examining whether the protection of public health made intervention necessary. The project will consider such matters as, for example, the trade in counterfeit medicinal products over the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to build on this analysis, on which work has already begun, and will, on the basis of it, arrive at policy solutions to the question of how any loopholes in the law may be closed. If it turns out to be necessary, we will have to carry out a wholesale revision of European law on medicines. These attempts at resolving the situation will of course be based on impact assessments, but I would like to assure you that we will do everything in our power to prevent counterfeit medicinal products continuing to find their way onto our markets in the future and thus putting people’s health at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I look forward to the action plan, but I worry whether the scale of the response is equal to the scale of the problem. Two weeks ago the International Narcotics Control Board talked about what it called the ‘flood of counterfeit medicines’, perhaps between 25 and 50% of medicines in developing countries are fake, and in Europe, as you have mentioned, sales on the internet are one of the main challenges. Can we try and help locate the people and businesses behind illicit internet sites?</p>
<p class="contents">Can we, while maintaining the avenues for parallel trading, try and make sure that illegality does not creep in to parallel trading?</p>
<p class="contents">What do you think about a ban on the repackaging of medicines?</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of loopholes in legislation are you talking of closing?</p>
<p class="contents">Could we have criminal legislation on aligning the definitions and the penalties on offences in the law enforcement third pillar? I just think that there needs to be a great sense of urgency. This is killing people, and seriously harming health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention is that the project of which I spoke should supplement the ongoing international measures already taken by the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe, and devise a TeleMed-style solution for Europe, whilst the parallel trading project will address specifically those aspects relating to the safety of patients.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to really sort out the problem, we first have to know exactly how the land lies, and so we have asked the Member States for the necessary information. I think we will have collated all the information we need by the end of the year and will then be able to take some decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the same view as you do of the situation in developing countries, which is scandalous in the extreme. During a debate about it in this House last year, I said that we would do everything in our power to help the developing countries to put in place the structures to ensure that the medicinal products finding their way onto their markets were in line with international standards. The problem is, quite simply, that, in many developing countries, the administrative structures required to exercise proper control are not in place, and that is why I agree with my fellow-Commissioner Mr Michel that it is vitally important in terms of development that we step up our efforts at supporting the developing countries in this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As part of the Lisbon Strategy, the European Strategy for Growth and Employment and the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship, which measures does the Commission intend to take to boost private entrepreneurship, in particular among young people, and to create the right environment for risk-taking so as to modernise, develop and promote the competitiveness of Europe's economy?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European economy is not as dynamic as it could be, it is not creating as many jobs as it could, and the main reason is that we do not have enough enterprises. We do not have enough enterprises because we in Europe do not have enough people who are prepared to take entrepreneurial initiatives and to carry entrepreneurial risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important answer to your question is therefore that we need a growing understanding in our societies themselves that it is enterprises that create jobs, that there have to be entrepreneurs with the courage to do that, and that entrepreneurial activity has to be accepted as socially responsible, socially useful activity. We therefore need to work for greater social acceptance of entrepreneurial initiatives. The Commission has developed a large number of initiatives there in the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the European Agenda for Entrepreneurship published a progress report, from which you can see that we have greatly increased the resources for the Community financial instruments for enterprises, that we have provided the stimulus for the formation of mini-companies by schoolchildren and students, so that they can learn entrepreneurial activity, and we have the database run by the Euro Information Centres to help find business partners.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to create growth and employment, it must provide a general social framework that encourages entrepreneurial initiative. As mindsets are formed early in life, education can make an important contribution to successfully promoting entrepreneurship. On the basis of the work done in the Member States, the Commission was able to adopt a communication on promoting entrepreneurship in schools and universities in February 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see all European schoolchildren and students having the opportunity of coming into contact with business reality during their time at school and during their studies. In many European countries that is already done in an exemplary manner. But in a number of countries there are still substantial deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Commission is very much involved in putting across entrepreneurial ways of thinking at university level. We know that the experience in America has been extraordinarily positive. Universities that offer to teach entrepreneurial skills and thinking report great successes in that a much higher percentage of graduates from those universities are willing to start a business after completing their studies than is the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three other important ways in which we can help to make it easier for people to start businesses. Firstly, there is the whole ‘better regulation’ project with simplification of the law and cutting red tape. Many people are prevented psychologically from starting a business because they believe there are too many regulations and that they are too complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because many people do not even start to set up a business because they think it is much too complicated, last year we proposed to the European Council that the Member States should commit themselves to limiting the time needed to start a company to one week. That should be the case in all the Member States by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that we are looking very hard at the question of the negative consequences of bankruptcy. How do we deal with the failure of the first attempt? As you know, in America it is no problem at all socially if the first attempt at business is a failure. In many European countries, the first failure is also the last.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to mention is the problem of finance, which is a key problem for the creation of new businesses. The Commission has increased the funding available for the period 2007 to 2013 considerably. Most of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme goes into financial instruments: we are making more than EUR 1 billion available here for credits and counter-guarantees, for national guarantee facilities and other modern financial instruments, including the provision of share capital. The programme is being very well received by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Over all we have therefore taken a wide range of measures, which I hope will encourage more new young businesses in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do they recognise such talent, do they acknowledge the courage of wanting to do something and do they encourage it, or do they act like bureaucrats? I think European financial institutions are well-advised to take what you have said, the qualifications of a person who wants to start a business, his talent, his knowledge and his ability, into account when assessing his creditworthiness.

Engineering work is essential for many sectors of the economy and therefore deserves our full attention.</p>
<p class="contents">A high-level working group, the ‘Mechanical Engineering Dialogue’, was set up at the end of 2005 to make a comprehensive analysis of the sector’s competitiveness. This initiative follows similar action in other manufacturing sectors, and further initiatives will follow shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The working group’s initial findings show that questions of training and qualification are a serious challenge for manufacturing. Not only are the absolute numbers of young technical staff entering working life inadequate, but there are also problems with retaining skilled personnel in the industry and with the public image of engineering. There are also problems with the necessary adaptation to various changes that are currently taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking at these matters together with industry and the Member States. Since the Commission has only a very limited mandate in the field of vocational training, it is particularly important that other groups and affected parties make their contribution. In particular, the Commission is comparing the different approaches taken by the Member States in order to find the best possible solutions and to define the right framework for innovation to develop. Member States need to do more, especially as regards course contents, lifelong learning and worker mobility, while it is up to industry to define future requirements accurately and to make technical occupations more attractive.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Verheugen appears to be opposed to proposals from Commissioner Dimas regarding binding provisions concerning the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for all categories of automobile, calling for a more 'integrated approach'. One of the factors under discussion concerns the use of biofuels which is related to a very important and sensitive issue in the Greek farming sector, that is to say the problems faced by sugar producers.

The assumption underlying your question is completely wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">There has not been and is not the slightest difference between Mr Dimas and myself in the matter of binding upper limits for CO2 emissions – quite the opposite. The two of us were the first to say, in December of last year, that legislative measures are necessary. In November last year I announced here in Parliament that we would be laying down statutory measures with binding limits.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, we are basing ourselves on the recommendations of the High Level Group <span class="italic">CARS 21</span>, about which I have reported to Parliament. That group recommended the ‘integrated approach’, and the Commission included it in its decision, which was adopted with the agreement of both Mr Dimas and myself. The integrated approach means that greater use will also be made of biofuels to meet the reduced emission target of an average of 120g CO2 per km for the European automobile fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given a large number of interviews on this very subject both before and after the Commission’s decision, pointing out how important it is to increase the proportion of biofuels now. I am therefore very pleased that last week the European Council decided to follow the Commission’s and my proposal to increase the proportion of biofuels to as much as 10% of European fuel consumption in the next few years. I can therefore assure you that not only are there no differences of opinion between Mr Dimas and myself on this issue, but we are working together to do all we can to reach these targets that the Commission has decided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of those benchmarks is the increase in the proportion of biofuels. There is as yet no specific programme for how this increase in biofuel content is to be achieved, especially as the European Council only accepted the Commission proposal on Friday of last week. The Commission will now be making the relevant proposals very quickly. I can however tell you that the general opinion is that we in Europe will be able to solve the problem by mixing biofuels with the conventional fuels produced in refineries. We are convinced that we should concentrate on second-generation biofuels in order to avoid harmful ecological side effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy supports biofuels through the single area payment. As you know, farmers are not allowed to grow food plants on land that has been set aside, but they can grow non-food plants, including plants for the production of biofuels. The growing of such crops, including sugar beet, can be supported by the granting of energy plant premiums of EUR 45 per hectare. This rule has now been extended to all Member States. The new EU policy for rural and regional development also provides support measures for renewable energies. The same applies for the research framework programme, which concentrates primarily on second-generation biofuels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is a response to the request made by the Council in the middle of 2004 towards a harmonisation of the definition of veal within the European Community. It follows a lengthy consultation process involving different stakeholders and Member State experts, during which the Commission has demonstrated its readiness to take into account, to the greatest extent possible, traditions and habits in different Member States. The Commission has also considered the main feature of the consumption and the production of veal within the European Union. It allows the main problems as regards the marketing of the meat of these young animals to be addressed, and I think it offers a balanced response to most of the concerns that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, it is now possible to reach an agreement on this difficult issue. Many of the amendments that have been proposed or introduced aim to simplify the Commission proposal in order to try to cut red tape, to reduce the administrative burdens and the cost as much as possible, and in principle these amendments should not raise any problems. I am looking forward to listening to the discussion, and hopefully we can find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a sensitive matter on which the Member States and the European Commission have been seeking an agreement since the beginning of the nineties, as the Commissioner has just reminded us.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the problem is that usually, when meat from calves is sold, no reference is made either to the type of feed the animals are given or to their age at the time of slaughter, although production practices differ greatly from one Member State to another. Consequently, because of differing interpretations, traders and consumers find themselves faced with very different products, but sold under one and the same description: veal.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Commission has emphasised, this practice could disturb trade and encourage unfair competition. Studies show that the term ‘veal’ is a sales description that adds value and some traders make use of it to benefit from substantially higher market prices, when in fact they are marketing meat from young bovine animals with very different organoleptic qualities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at the request of several Member States and of the European beef sector, who want clarification, that the Commission has set out its initial proposal, which I think is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is to lay down precise sales descriptions according to age at the time of slaughter, a criterion that is significant enough and easier to monitor than the feeding regime. It proposes the introduction of two categories and the use of a letter to identify them: ‘X’ for animals slaughtered up to the age of eight months and ‘Y’ for animals slaughtered between the ages of nine and twelve months, letters that Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has chosen to replace with ‘V’ and ‘Z’ in order to avoid confusions linked with gender.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first category, the sales description will continue to use the term ‘veal’. For the second, a different term will be used:‘<span class="italic">jeune bovin</span>’ in French, ‘<span class="italic">vitellone</span>’ in Italian, etc. On this subject I refer you to Annex II(B) of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an exception for trade carried out on the domestic market in four countries, Denmark, Greece, Spain and the Netherlands, where, in order to take account of local customs and cultural traditions, it will still be possible to use the term ‘veal’ in the second category.</p>
<p class="contents">The terms ‘veal’, ‘veal meat’, or any other sales description defined in the proposal may no longer be used in the labelling of meat obtained from animals aged more than 12 months. Traders who wish to supplement the sales descriptions laid down in this proposal with other, optional information, such as the feed used, will, of course, be able to do so. Therefore, coming from Limousin, I could speak to you about ‘white veal’.</p>
<p class="contents">I was keen to propose changes to the European Commission’s initial proposal to make this legislation more coherent and restrictive and I thank my colleagues for having supported me. In particular I asked for a system of penalties to be introduced in the event of failure to respect the rules, and I proposed amendments to include within the scope of the regulation meat-based products intended for human consumption, prepared, processed or cooked products. I also insisted that the sales description should be used at each stage of production and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that certain points are not acceptable and could spoil the balance of the proposal for a regulation. I am talking about Amendments 8 and 12, which were adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Amendment 8 suggests that designations and IGPs (protected geographical indications) registered after the publication of this regulation could be exempted from it, and this is not consistent with the legislation as a whole. Designations of origin and protected geographical indications that have already been registered are not affected, but it is important that new AOCs and IGPs should be subject to the provisions of this regulation, otherwise they could be completely bypassed.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 12 calls into question the proposal for a regulation based on the criterion of age. In fact, as Annex II shows, the United Kingdom has chosen to give the description ‘veal’ to the first category, and the description ‘beef’ to the second category. This country’s specific requirements have, therefore, been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I do not support the two new Amendments 26 and 27 presented to plenary. These two amendments introduce a new derogation that, in my opinion, is incompatible with Article 3 of the Regulation, as they allow a given Member State not to apply the regulation if its production of animals in the first category, aged less than 8 months, does not exceed 3% of the total production of animals aged less than 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to support me and to reject these four amendments which would reduce the scope of the Regulation, which is supposed to apply to the whole of the European Union and the scope of harmonisation of the first category ‘up to eight months’, which has been very difficult to attain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Laying down precise sales descriptions according to age at slaughter – an easier criterion to monitor than type of feed – to be used by all Member States will make it easier for consumers to understand and will prevent any possible unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important that the term ‘veal’ and other terms defined in the Commission proposal should not be used in labelling meat from animals aged over 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I consider vital is that meat imported from non-EU countries should be subject to this regulation, thus preventing any risk of unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with the rapporteur, Mrs Bourzai, whom I should like to congratulate on the excellent work she has produced and on the dialogue she initiated, I believe that the Commission’s proposal is a good one and that this subject has been calling out for a solution for a long time. In addition, we both think that the letters considered by the Commission for identifying carcasses are not the most appropriate, since they may give rise to confusion with the sex of the animal. This and other aspects of the draft regulation were improved by amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and included in the report that we are debating here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that any possible reservations regarding particular traditions that call the new provisions into question should not be taken to the point of jeopardising the work carried out by the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would remind Members that the descriptions proposed by the Commission were arrived at after consultation with organisations from the various Member States, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, and that the draft regulation allows for the possibility of amending the list of descriptions in Annex II in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall also congratulate the Commission on its excellent proposal, which should bring more clarity into the marketing of calf meat and enable the consumer to be better informed.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is the result of a long process of negotiation within the Member States and the relevant professional associations to give clearer information to consumers and allow fairer competition between the different producers. Most of the latter were actually penalised by a designation that applied to a product, veal, whose physiological development resulted in great differences within a few months because of its rapidity. A veal calf develops, within a few weeks, from being a monogastric mammal, during the time that it feeds almost entirely on milk, to being a ruminant mammal with four stomachs as soon as it moves on to fibrous foods such as grass, hay and cereals. It is not difficult to imagine the consequences of this development on the dietary and nutritional composition of the meat, including a different vitamin content and the white, pink or red colouring of the meat resulting from the fact, in particular, that there is no iron in milk but there is in plants.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, to treat as equal and call ‘veal’ meat from an animal up to the age of six or eight months that has been fed on milk and meat from an animal aged 14 to 16 months that eats, grazes and ruminates, allows neither the consumer nor the producer to determine what he is actually eating.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European area, this harmonisation which makes it possible to differentiate between calf meat and that of young bovine animals, and I say this without in any way prejudging the quality of one or the other, is an important step in terms of respect for the consumer and the producers and reflects our concern for healthier and more balanced nutrition for more responsible consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the past, there was veal when the farmer’s wife was in her confinement. We used to call that ‘fasted veal’. It was distinguished by being white meat, because the calf had only ever drunk milk. Then some people got the idea of penning the animals in and depriving them of natural food because the meat produced that way was considered good and expensive. They were then fattened up to 170 to 200 kg. Those calves still had white meat because they did not get any feed containing iron. That is not changed by this directive. However, because that meat fetched a particularly good price on the market, the practice was in that way indirectly supported. If you ever saw how calves locked in their stalls started to gnaw at the gates to get something of what they really needed, then you will know what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Incorporating the time factor has not put an end to that, but it does now indirectly support species-appropriate animal husbandry. Mother cows are kept at pasture, and the calves drink milk for several months but are also already eating grass, which contains iron, making their meat pink or red. What the directive still does not contain, although it may encourage it indirectly, is the quality of animal husbandry and the process of the animals’ growth.</p>
<p class="contents">An end – or at any rate the beginning of an end – is now put to the practice of paying a high price for meat that comes from animals that have been tortured, and we will soon have nice pink veal from happy animals. That does not mean that the farmer’s wife will no longer get white meat in her confinement, but that meat really will be from calves that have ‘fasted’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear, well written, well documented and comes with a good proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With the veal market, once again, we come face to face with the distortions of competition, indeed frauds, brought about by the single market in all fields. We shall be called upon to speak about it again in relation to wine, Commissioner, with countries that have a land registry and others that do not, with the composition of wines that can vary depending on the country while the description remains the same. There is also the area of VAT, with the intracommunity frauds that the single market allows, with fiscal dumping and our Baltic friends who benefit from their ‘flat tax’, to give themselves an advantage. There is, of course, the veal market, where, if there is not fraud, there is unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Forgive me, Mr President, but they say that our Spanish or Danish friends have old calves more than eight, nine or ten months old, sort of grandfather calves, that they still call ‘veal’. Obviously, with a price difference of two or three euros on leaving the abattoir, according to whether it is a real calf or an extremely old grandfather calf, it is sure that the added value can be extremely profitable, even though 800 000 tonnes of calves are not all involved – thank God! – since 80% of the production and 70% of the consumption takes place in countries that have harmonised the definition of veal or of vitellone. The distortion of competition is, therefore, limited, but it does exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, after almost 20 years in Parliament, for once I congratulate the Commission, which proves that you should never give up hope about anything. The system that has been proposed to us is excellent. First of all defining the age of veal according to a fixed limit of more or less than eight months old is very clear, just as it is very clear to distinguish them by two letters, X and Y. In this respect, there was an ambiguity, hormonal or sexual or something, and the rapporteur did well to propose the letter V as veal and the letter Z as, we do not quite know what, but it is better. Providing for a system of penalties is excellent and extending the legislation to meat based preserves, that is very good. Excluding AOCs and IGPs, everyone can only be delighted about that.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, Mr President, Commissioner, perhaps all that offers us a good example: if one could define right or left wing politicians according to their age, according to their diet, according to whether they are monogastric or according to whether they are mammals, it would make it easier for electors to know whether they are dealing with a left wing calf or a right wing calf. Maybe our rapporteur is proposing this as an avenue for us to explore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By supporting the Commission’s proposal as modified by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s report, we can put an end to the further spread of the abuse of competitive advantages stemming from inadequacies in regulation as well as of confusing market information about beef.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the diversity of regulations used in Member States provides opportunities for abuses, and therefore in numerous cases there have been requests for clarification of the definition of ‘veal’ and for its harmonisation among various States. Since the manner of producing and marketing the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less varies from one country to the next, therefore the finished manufactured products can also differ significantly amongst each other. As a result, they come to market under different names and their selling prices can also differ significantly among each other.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider important the Council’s proposed directive appearing on the agenda of this sitting, which is to regulate the market and provide more precise consumer information than is presently available. In this way we will be able to rule out market distortions in marketing, and provide the opportunity to solve the resulting problems with nation-wide measures. The harmonisation and identification of trade names in the various Member States can contribute to market transparency. In addition, we would thereby make it possible for consumers to be properly informed about meat originating in any Member State. At a later stage we will need to devote attention as well to ensuring that the end users receive information on the trade names that will be introduced, especially if this would differ in a Member State from the customary and commonly used names. Those who stand to gain most from such harmonisation processes are the consumers and the manufacturers, since a transparent system of labelling offers a higher level of consumer protection and more reliable control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely for this reason that I would like once more to welcome the systematic effort shown by the Commission here and in similar matters, to create appropriate regulations, and I would like in particular once again to congratulate Mrs Bourzai for her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I said at the outset, the majority of these amendments should not create any difficulties. I think we are all along the same lines in trying to simplify our legislation as much as possible without jeopardising the system.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are amendments that cannot be accepted. This is the case for Amendments 2, 11 and 16 in particular, concerning the display of information on commercial documents. This would put an additional burden on the sector. Similarly, Amendments 1 and 9, regarding the extension of the field of application to cover cooked products, are not indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments 8 and 21 would not clarify the approval procedure for PDOs and PGIs and would also overly complicate the amendment procedure of the different annexes in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 12, aimed at marketing the use of sale descriptions established for meat of the second category of these animals –those between 8 and 12 months – I am prepared to try to find a solution with the ministers on the usefulness of this option.</p>

<p class="contents">The added value of this Convention, a real beginning for a code for international maritime labour, lies in that it makes the existing standards more effective, that it adapts them to globalisation, and above all that it makes it possible to increase the number of ratifications by States. The Commission, like the ILO (International Labour Organisation), considers that the goal of a level playing field is fundamental. We are convinced that the Maritime Labour Convention will contribute to that, eliminate shipping that does not respect minimum standards and make careers at sea more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention must, however, be ratified speedily in order to produce these positive effects. A decision authorising Member States to ratify the Convention is legally required given that the ILO’s current rules do not allow the Community as such to ratify the text, even if it includes provisions that fall within the competence of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid delaying the ratification procedures, the Commission has endeavoured to present its proposal for a decision hard on the heels of the adoption of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission anticipates the principle of authorisation to ratify and suggests 31 December 2008 as the target date for depositing the instruments of ratification. Consequently, the Commission wishes to retain a strong wording on the commitment to ratify the Convention and rejects any editing that could weaken this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McDonald, I should like to thank you and to give you my full support for your report, which upholds the target date of 2008. Taking into account the level of European standards, one may think that third countries will be much more affected by the Convention coming into force than the Member States, who already apply more exacting standards. When the Convention comes into force it will reduce the disparities between the standards of most of the third countries and those of the Community, which should encourage fairer conditions for competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Whole sections of the Convention are already covered by equivalent provisions in Community law. Member States, therefore, will not have to review their legislation entirely and will be able to accelerate ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can understand the internal constraints of Member States and, in this context, can be more flexible about the time limit, but on the principle of a definite time limit without conditions attached. It would be very sad to lose the momentum we had during the negotiations in Geneva by weakening the principle of depositing the instruments of ratification.</p>

<p class="contents">The Convention brings together 65 previous ILO conventions into one consolidated document. It sets minimum requirements for seafarers, with provisions on employment conditions and recruitment, working hours, wage protection, leave and repatriation, accommodation, recreation, food and catering, health and medical care, welfare and social security. It will immeasurably improve the conditions of the millions of workers in this sector worldwide. Because the maritime industry is global, it is important that global standards be adopted in order to limit the negative effects of globalisation, in particular social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention, when ratified, will apply to all ships, even those flagged by countries which have not individually ratified. It will shift the behaviour pattern of the whole industry by creating minimum standards, avoiding social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately following its adoption in February 2006, Chris Horrocks, Secretary-General of the International Shipping Federation, said, ‘This landmark decision is just the beginning. Now we have to ensure that every government ratifies this Convention as soon as possible and applies it in full.’</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2006, the European Community Shipowners’ Association and the European Transport Workers’ Federation confirmed their full support for the Convention in a letter to EU transport ministers. In their letter, they strongly recommend that Member States ratify the Convention and engage in processes to that end as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The representative of the ILO, Cleopatra Doumbia-Henry, speaking at the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, where it was discussed, said that a delay in ratification could slow down the extraordinary momentum which has built up in support of the Convention. Strong words indeed for a representative of the ILO!</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, having invested much in the negotiations on the Convention and ensuring that it was compatible with EU law, is also on record as supporting ratification of the Convention by the end of 2008. Ratification by that date would enable the Convention to enter into force by 2009, almost ten years after negotiations began.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the only people who do not want the Convention to be ratified by 2008 are the Member States, who want, in their own words, ‘to make efforts to ratify the Convention, preferably before 31 December 2010’.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that without the Convention, shipping in Europe will find it difficult to compete, as it is increasingly being undercut by ships flying flags of convenience. I would urge Members to endorse the Convention overwhelmingly and, in adopting this report, send a message to the Member States that the shipping industry, and particularly workers within that industry, cannot wait. Member States should stop dragging their feet and ratify this Convention speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make some additional remarks about other measures that could be undertaken by the EU. The Commission’s excellent communication on strengthening maritime labour standards provides a good starting point, and I hope that my report makes some small contribution to doing just that. The EU needs to look at areas not fully covered by the Convention and, in particular, the regulation of recruitment agencies. The EU should look at how to strengthen, complement or extend the standards of the ILO Convention and to go further in protecting the rights and interests of seafarers. The EU should look at adopting measures to reduce the risks of different interpretations of the Convention between EU Member States. Proposals should be brought forward to allow for family-friendly facilities to be available on ships. The EU should try to enforce minimum employment standards and wages for all vessels operating in its waters and, in particular, I would say that the Commission should retable the proposal for an EU ferries directive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the first and the most important step is the ratification of this ILO Maritime Labour Convention. There is no time to be wasted in this matter and there can be no delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from the quality of work of our seafarers, careers at sea may become more attractive, which we welcome, given the need for seafarers for the competitiveness of our shipping industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This convention is also very important for global shipping, because certain standards for the organisation of maritime labour will be applied uniformly. Today the various states apply fragmentary provisions already in existence through this convention but, apart from that, conditions of healthy competition are also safeguarded; with the clause precluding more favourable treatment, protection will be provided to the fleets of the states that ratify the convention, thereby preventing social dumping, to which the rapporteur referred just now and which is unfair to our seafarers and shipping companies, given that, as things stand, numerous companies already have the opportunity to recruit seafarers from countries with no social standards of the level which the international convention wishes to impose and to which the European Union aspires.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important issue is that it introduces the maritime labour certificate and the maritime labour declaration. This system comes under the control of the port state, in which case it is possible for ships to be inspected and detained in the event of doubt as to whether these standards are being complied with. I believe that the principles that we wish to disseminate throughout the world, over and above the application to our political entity, are expressed in this convention and it is a good thing that all the Member States are endeavouring to ratify it soon. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we had amendments for deferral to 2010, because we know that there is not the same type of ratification in the various Member States and we believe that it would be possible for sufficient time to be allowed to prepare such ratification properly. In any event, the prevailing opinion is that we must have completed the procedures by 2008, meaning that we need to hurry up and set a good example of proper integration and application, starting in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus it is acknowledging how important it is for the status of seafarers to be safeguarded within the framework of globalisation and for exploitative practices to be prevented. It also safeguards the existence of a Community regime coordinating the social insurance systems. In ratifying the convention, the Member States will primarily be strengthening the global social framework, because they are aiming for decent conditions worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it necessary to strengthen maritime safety, so that careers at sea attract young Europeans and so that 17 000 vacancies for Community seafarers can be filled, especially vacancies for bridge and engine officers. This is an opportunity, Commissioner, for us to emphasise how very important it is to strengthen maritime education and the pan-European campaign for career guidance in careers at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Current progress in technology allows direct daily contact between seafarers and their families and complements safe working conditions. A campaign to attract people to careers at sea should include employment prospects for disabled seafarers in activities on shore or parallel alternative employment between sea and shore. We also need to strengthen maritime jobseekers offices, so that there is optimum management of the available workforce. It is a good thing that, at European level, social dialogue is to start between seafarers and shipowners and we hope that it will result in agreement. The proper application of the ILO international convention also makes provision for monitoring by a tripartite committee with the participation of representatives of shipowners, seafarers and the state.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would remind you that the European Commission quite rightly withdrew the proposal for minimum employment standards and wages for seafarers working on its waters in 2001. Plans for equal treatment of Community and non Community seafarers are good, but in practice a Community directive on car ferries cannot be applied as all voyages are international. We call on the European Commission to be especially careful when it comes to the compatibility of its proposals with the international law of the sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt whatsoever that this consolidated Convention on the working conditions of seafarers is an extremely important step forward. It is an attempt to bring up to date some conventions which go back as far as 1920, and it seeks to put in place some global standards which hopefully will lead to more humane conditions on board ships.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been pointed out, however, even the higher minimum standards which the Convention will set out will still not reach the standards for employees and employment in the various EU Member States. It is regrettable, therefore, that EU Member States are resisting a rapid ratification of this particular Convention. In my view, it is part of the race to the bottom which many Member States have resisted. For instance in Ireland, there was the manning of ferries directive, and the experience was that Irish Ferries sought to sack their entire staff and subsequently employ cheaper labour at less than half the legal minimum wage rate in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think that the blocking of the manning of ferries directive and the attempt to slow down the ratification of this Convention is symptomatic of some Member States’ attitudes. I agree with everything that Ms McDonald has said with regard to the need for Europe-wide regulation. However, I say to her that in order to make this regulation, we need QMV in this area of work, which we do not have at present. In order to get QMV we need the proposed European Constitution and I suggest that Ms McDonald ought to review her opposition to that Constitution if we are serious about making progress as regards implementing common labour standards across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Erika case is typical of those disasters that are avoidable but that nonetheless happen because the gains of a handful of individuals must necessarily take precedence over everything. That is the outcome of liberal logic, of profit pushed to the extreme, according to which, for the sake of making a few euros more, everything is permitted, including disregarding the most elementary safety rules to the point of catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this same logic that we have seen at work in the miserably famous case of <span class="italic">Irish Ferries</span>, which soon will have nothing Irish about it except its name. In the name of profit, the entire staff complement of a company, which is nonetheless operating correctly, can be thrown overboard.</p>
<p class="contents">Again it is this same logic that pushes some shipowners carrying out intracommunity cabotage to operate ships with insufficient crew and in conditions that put both the crew and shipping as a whole at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">These miserable working conditions go so far as to jeopardise seafaring traditions and expertise because the image they give of the sector is such that it has become more and more difficult to recruit European seamen.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this pursuit of profit is never mentioned. It is better to put forward the argument of international competition, which is essentially Asian and obviously unfair, to justify these practices, even when this competition does not exist. Has anyone ever seen Chinese companies operating ferries in the Baltic or in the Channel?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question of denying this competition. It does affect part of the sector and it also has its merits, but it must be controlled and it must be fair. It is possible to choose the basis on which it should operate. And if, sadly, social dumping is a reality in the maritime sector, it is not inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, those who accept it and seek to profit from it, but one can also reject it by pushing for a general rise in social standards in the world as a whole so that, in the end, everyone can find themselves on an equal footing in terms of international competition. That is, as you will have realised, the way that I would like Europe to go.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, as we know, competitiveness will not be achieved through minimising costs and lowering social standards. It can only be achieved through quality. The quality of vessels, the quality of crews, safeguarded by means of decent working and training conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ILO Convention that is being discussed this evening offers us the opportunity to make that choice. It does not solve all of the problems, but it represents a step forward. And it offers European shipowners and the Member States an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to defending certain values enshrined in the European Union and in its social model. On signing it in February 2006, they were signing a statement of intent in that regard. We now expect them to move on to actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as shipowners are concerned, I can only welcome the fact that they have given their firm and willing commitment to entering into social, European dialogue, with their trade union partners, with a view to signing, by the end of the year, a collective European agreement that would include the relevant provisions of this Convention. An initial cycle of negotiations has ended today and the climate seems very constructive. This is a good thing and I think that we can also welcome the constructive role played by the European Commission in facilitating this process.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Member States, they hold the key to bringing this Convention into force. It has been said, if the European Union and the European Free Trade Association ratify it, then the Convention will come into effect and will apply everywhere. If Europe ratifies speedily, other nations will follow, and Europe will have been the driving force, in showing that another way, apart from exploitation and dumping, is possible, and that competition can go together with responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential, therefore, if we believe in the unique quality of the European model, to see to it that this Convention is ratified speedily. It is also essential to keep to the target date of the end of 2008 proposed by the ILO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to say that the ILO Convention is an initial response. By raising working standards, its effect will be to allow fairer competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has undertaken a very in-depth study on the ferries sector. The Commission will assess subsequently whether a new proposal for a directive on this subject would be relevant and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like also to say that we are aware that the target date of December 2008 is ambitious, but it is realistic. The ILO has worked out a plan of action that relies on the Maritime Labour Convention coming into force in 2010 and, at the latest, in 2011. The Commission, in proposing the depositing of instruments of ratification before the end of 2008, guarantees that Member States will be in line with this timescale. Taking into account the ILO’s own rules, if Member States deposit their instruments of ratification at the end of 2008 at the latest, the Convention would come into force before the beginning of 2010. You see, therefore, that it is essential that we stick to that date.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also answer Mr Navarro and Mrs Panayotopoulos. Alongside the European Parliament’s work in relation to the opinion on the draft decision authorising ratification of the Convention, the social partners have come together to negotiate a possible joint agreement on the basis of this same Convention. I would remind you that the method of joint dialogue is a good thing for the European Union and it is true that I myself had the opportunity to express to the social partners, that is, both the shipowners and the unions, my wish to see them sign an agreement on this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The social partners who have the existing text do not have to renegotiate it but rather to select the relevant provisions to add to Community law. It seems now as if the prospect of a joint agreement by the end of 2007 is really plausible. As soon as it has an agreement from the social partners, the Commission will propose a directive to ensure that the provisions of the agreement will be respected in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Parliament, we can expect the necessary ratification of the Convention and, thanks to the social partners, we have a joint agreement that will make it possible to speedily introduce the new provisions into European law. I think that in this way we shall have worked well together for seafarers’ conditions and for a very important social advance, which will encourage, as you pointed out just now, the recruitment of young seamen, seamen whom the European Union needs in order to develop its maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly thank Parliament, Mr President, for its extremely determined action in support of this great Convention. I am happy to see that Europe is leading the movement and, in some way, helping to advance that globalisation with a human face that we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My homeland, Estonia, has been a maritime country for centuries. Ernest Hemingway noted that one could find an Estonian in every port in the world. In the last ten years, however, we have lost 57% of jobs in shipping.</p>

This Regulation set up common rules for the airworthiness of aircraft and established the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">You agreed that an optimum and uniform level of safety could only be achieved by extending the scope of this text, and consequently the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which have been extended to air operations, pilot licensing and safety of third-country aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">You also expressly asked the Commission to make a proposal to this end. It is time to put an end to an anomaly. While planes develop in complete freedom within a unified market, the safety level remains disparate between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">You know as well as I do that the rules worked out by specialised intergovernmental organisations are implemented very differently within the Community. Consequently there are great national disparities, not to mention the fact that it is not always the most rigorous standards that are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked that we should pursue efforts to improve the general level of air safety in Europe. That is the goal of the proposal that we are discussing, since it aims to extend the common rules to air operations, pilot licensing and the safety of third-country aircraft, that is, to give the Community tools that would contribute to increasing the safety of air transport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also reinforces the obligations of Member States in respect of inspection of planes of both third countries and of Member States. It gives the Agency the power of inspection extended to all the activities of the civil aviation authorities of the Member States and their companies as well as the airlines, and that is in order to check that they are complying with the common rules. A system of penalties is also envisaged, such as withdrawal of mutual recognition in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">This text is part of a coherent package of measures for the improvement of aviation safety. I will briefly remind you of them: the black list, which allows those airlines that least respect safety rules to be banned from our countries, the strengthening of systems for the inspection of planes – SAFA directive – and very soon the Commission is going to propose completing this regulatory framework by extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency to airport security and to air navigation, as set out in the attached regulatory proposal that you are examining today.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, by 2010, the Community will have a coherent and uniform set of safety rules and a unique organisation, the European Aviation Safety Agency, responsible for preparing, implementing and completing their application.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate you and to thank you for your contribution to this strategy for the strengthening of European aviation safety. I shall listen with interest to your speeches on this subject that is obviously vital for the citizens of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the content itself, what is the state of European airspace at present? In theory, we have a single European sky, but we currently have 27 different safety standards, and that makes some things possible that I do not believe are good. For example, less reputable airlines are currently still able to have the pick of safety standards in Europe, so to speak, depending on the country in which they want to be certified. Then there are European aircraft that do not see their home countries for several years on end, because they operate on other routes and can therefore be inspected only inadequately or not at all, and it has also been relatively difficult to check aircraft flying into the European Union from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expressly welcomed the Commission proposal, which the Commissioner has just presented – and I think the great majority of this House did too. The thing on which we were not always entirely agreed was the way to get the outcome we so much wanted. In principle, I can distinguish three areas here: we were agreed that it is absolutely necessary to check third-country aircraft efficiently, and we were also agreed that the EASA should be able to carry our ramp inspections unhindered.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on how the EASA Management Board should be appointed in future was rather more difficult. In my opinion, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as the competent committee, in its vote proposed a very positive Europeanisation of the whole procedure, with something of a shift from the Member States to the Council and the European Parliament. The second essential question was: what qualifications should be required of the Management Board’s members? Here, too, a satisfactory solution has been found. The question of whether the EASA should be able to impose penalties was rather more difficult. Opinions on this in the House differ, and we shall see how things turn out in the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two things that were particularly difficult and which we were unable to get accepted, but I would like to mention them anyway. Firstly – and I have never made any secret of my conviction in the matter – we were unable to agree on more extensive rules for the certification of cabin crew. There seems to be a religious war taking place here – Mr Jarzembowski is just waving at me as a proponent of that war – with an uncompromising For on one side and an uncompromising Against on the other. I can only hope that the solution we have now found will open a door for a solution in the future and that, in the interests of cabin crews and above all of passenger safety, we will not have to wait for that future solution for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question where it was particularly difficult was the one where it is in fact always difficult, namely funding. The EASA budget amounted to 70 million in 2006, funded partly by certification and partly by the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with certification is, firstly, that it is increasingly difficult to get money for some certification tasks and, secondly, there is a desire, which I share, that these certification costs should not be as heavy a burden on small and medium-sized enterprises as on large undertakings, whose larger production runs make it easier for them. An interesting solution would have been to introduce a kind of passenger fee, if you think that 5 cents a ticket could fund half the EASA budget. But there was no agreement on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to tomorrow’s vote with great interest and would like to close by once again expressing my thanks for the close cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats agrees with the approach that, in this day and age, we need to extend the scope of activity of the European Aviation Safety Agency within reason, in order to enhance its effectiveness most importantly with regard to pilot licences, air traffic control and relations with developing countries. We also accept that for this purpose higher numbers and a larger budget are necessary, and are to be constantly subject to control, as this was expressed in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, however, to emphasise a few matters of principle. Firstly: I consider it important that as regards flight staff, we do not touch in any way the compromise concerning training and permits which we have already provided in another form under the so-called EU-OPS. Secondly: I consider it important that in authorising commercial and non-commercial activities, we should retain the distinction between the two. For apart from safety, the parameters of activity and their nature are different, and we should not just try with bureaucratic tools to cause private activities to atrophy. Likewise, in the case of medical examinations and leisure time activities, we must use the principle of subsidiarity. There is no need to complicate things.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the ever more complex tasks, we support the creation of an Executive Committee as well as, in the case of the Management Committee, a greater role in the community. The Council should appoint the delegate of the Member States and should consult with Parliament, and the Commission should hold 25% of the votes, which can be a realistic compromise. I consider it important that the tasks of the EASA in granting type ratings should not hinder the competitiveness of smaller businesses on account of the price and time factor, in comparison to the previous period of national permits. We are opposed to the idea that the EASA should carry out independent punitive responsibilities; this should remain the right of the Member States. It is crucial that the finances of the EASA be transparent, that no outside pressure group be able to gain decisive influence by means of donations. We further oppose the idea of shifting the burden associated with any new obligations to the passengers, since none of this branch receives subsidies but works entirely on a market basis, and the industry pays fees and contributions to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are looking at an extension of the European Aviation Safety Agency. I think it is a good idea, but only if it is done properly. If done in the wrong manner, it would not be positive. We, as members of this committee and this Parliament, know that air travel – and many of us use air travel more than we would like – is actually one of the safest modes of travel available. I think that we need a sensible response and in a single market it is quite appropriate that we should have a European response to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, there are issues in this report about which I have concerns and I would like to draw Members’ attention to some of these. Indeed, the rapporteur is aware of some of my concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 17 highlights my concerns about fines and penalties. I do not believe you can compromise on safety, so I do not think that fines and penalties are an effective measure for correcting safety problems. If there were a safety concern about a particular airline, I would be much happier if that airline’s licence were suspended or its certification revoked. I do not think that we can have half measures. I do not think that a fine or a penalty would make an airline improve in the way that a withdrawal of its certificate would.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mr Jarzembowski)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Well, let me carry on and I will not interrupt you. I could not hear a word you said, so it may have been important but I missed it completely!</p>
<p class="contents">I also have reservations about fees, because I believe this Agency needs to have a secure footing. The funding needs to be there, they need to know it is going to be continued and I do not think there can be arbitrary limits on the setting of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reservation I have – and Mr Leichtfried spoke about this – is the management board. I think that citizens expect the board members to pay a full role in ensuring their safety. Member States should be able to nominate and vote on qualified people to ensure that their interests and obligations are met.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns Amendment 1. There is a difference between safety and security. They are very separate and it is not clear to me – and I wait to be convinced – about what benefits would be brought by bringing security into this measure, which is to do with air safety. Air security is equally important, but it is a very separate issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is perhaps one of the nicest aspects of our work in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are considering amendments to the Regulations that came into force in 2002 – a logical step which gives us the opportunity to assess and extend the application of the Regulations in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments extend the jurisdiction of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and improve its management, budgeting and other procedures. Much attention has been paid to the confirmation of uniform aviation safety standards and supervision of their implementation. Aviation safety is a priority for all of us. The increasing intensity of air traffic compels us to have a single strong institution; this prevents lack of coordination or disputes between national aviation bodies from having negative consequences on aviation safety. This is why most of the proposed changes are intended to achieve the most important outcome: that of giving the EASA more authority in practice to perform the functions expected of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that in improving the Regulations we sought not just to be stricter and to centralise authority, but also to relax standards in those fields where changing practical circumstances make this possible. One such area is the use of amateur light aircraft. The proposed amendments set more relaxed standards for the issuance of private pilot licences and less strict rules for this type of activity, allowing authorised bodies, for example, pilots' associations, to issue ‘amateur light aircraft pilot licences’.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments are also related to the protection of information sources, which is important when trying to gather vital information about breaches of regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Accompanying remarks about the regulations are likewise aimed at improving the rules for recruiting EASA experts, with a view to maintaining the EASA's ability in the future to attract experienced specialists and to create the conditions for necessary internal training.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to invite colleagues to support these timely and very necessary amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with the rest of the world, Europe needs to ensure that its civil aviation operates safely and effectively when transporting both goods and passengers. The same applies to recreational aviation, aero sports and pilot training.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary technical, organisational and legal measures must therefore be taken. Clearly, issues relating to environmental protection and the workers employed in the aviation industry must not be neglected either. All this obviously has a specific financial dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 currently in force is almost five years old and has served its purpose fairly well. The time has now come, however, for us to take account of the new circumstances that have arisen partly because of the ongoing exponential increase in air traffic movements and the terrorist threat, and partly because of the need to tidy up and unify the whole complicated system of provisions, procedures and standards relating to aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion must therefore be in line with other provisions for this sector, starting with the Chicago Aviation Convention. We must cherish the hope that the European Aviation Safety Agency will be ready to undertake the tasks entrusted to it diligently, working in cooperation with individual Member States, which I believe is very important. We must also hope that safety standards will be unified and that the resulting standards will be high.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth highlighting the important role played by international cooperation in air transport. It is regrettable that there is a lack of representation of the European Union in the ICAO, which is the UN body dealing with global aviation issues. This shortcoming must be remedied. The regulation provides for the Aviation Safety Agency to deal also with aircraft from third countries. This is appropriate, and will allow checks to be carried out to ensure that third country operators meet safety standards before they are authorised to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur as regards increasing the competence of the Agency to include matters currently handled by Eurocontrol. On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I support this regulation and almost all the amendments. I would, however, like to emphasise that our activities must focus primarily on the passenger and on the safety and comfort of his or her journey, including both the time spent at airports and the time in flight. I believe it is necessary to continue the process of harmonising European and global provisions in this important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it seems logical to everyone at first that with a single European sky we also need uniform standards and strong uniform controls if we want to guarantee safety. We must also draw the obvious conclusion from our debate about the ‘black lists’ and see to it that third-country airlines can be inspected as strictly and closely as our own.</p>
<p class="contents">We have created some of the conditions. The Management Board as it is now proposed will be rather better able to act, and to act more quickly, than has been the case up until now. In the matter of funding, apart from the usual fee for the certification of aircraft, which clearly should not be replaced by any form of tax, we must think of certain fees for services that fall outside this area and are not, and cannot be, used commercially, so to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, there was of course much debate about cabin crews; we had the same debate with EU-OPS. It is an issue that needs to be resolved. We must create standards that will also be a safeguard against poor working conditions and social or safety dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Another task for the future will be to cut harmful emissions from aviation to an acceptable level and bring them into the European Union’s climate objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can only applaud, for example, the fact that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is able to contribute towards ensuring the free movement of air technology products, of transport services and of crew, on account of the fact that various licenses, permits and other documents issued via the agency or national offices, on the basis of their own rules, will be automatically accepted in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to express my support for the proposed regulation and for the rapporteur’s work, on the basis of the many years I spent as a pilot. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, measures can sometimes, despite the best intentions, be controversial or even detrimental to some of those affected. One example is the fact that enforcing the EASA in respect of aircraft up to 600 kg does not fundamentally improve aviation, but rather leads to extraordinary costs and a greater administrative load. Manufacturing ultralight aircraft represents an opportunity for our SMEs that have a strong export side to make their mark in difficult world markets including that of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the annex to the regulation unfortunately does not exempt this specialised sector of aviation technology from the implementation of the regulation, unlike a number of other cases, the document will have untold consequences for the competitiveness of manufacturers. It will lead to discrimination in the market, which is certainly not among the objectives of the new legislation and the legal amendments adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find the issues surrounding the imposition of fines confusing. I feel that it would be better to retain the previous practice of taking away licences or not awarding them in the first place. Fines are not a standard measure and there could be a risk of their misuse in the drive to boost the revenues of those in receipt of resources that are collected in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">One further point is that some of the proposals in the document affect Member State sovereignty, even though they are unconnected to the criteria of air transport safety. Consequently, we should monitor more carefully all of the consequences of our measures on all citizens and businesses in the EU, as part of the overall fight for greater safety. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We agreed this morning that there is a large transatlantic market for air services that we want to see further developed. Now the question is: who are the players? In the negotiations we clearly said that we want Europe to be America’s equal. That also means that we must develop the European Aviation Safety Agency into an equal partner of the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The situation today is that the FAA decides which aircraft must be repaired and which must be taken out of service, because it has a high level of competence and has tremendous power in world aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding today on extending the remit of the EASA must be seen in this context. We must progressively bring the EASA up to the same level as the FAA, so that we – Europe and the US – are also represented as partners in the administrative field.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Commissioner, as planned, in the next few weeks we should discuss quietly in committee the release of the reserves for the EASA. The fundamental question for me however is: what equipment and what staff must the EASA have in order to be recognised both by the national aviation safety authorities – because there are still misgivings about that – and by the FAA?</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue down this road – a gradual, careful expansion of the EASA’s competences for both equipment and personnel to make it in fact an equal partner to the FAA – then we will have done our best for our airlines and our passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the amendments we are proposing improve the text, amongst other things by simplifying the management of the Agency through the removal of the Executive Board, which was redundant. The independence of the Agency is guaranteed in terms of the economic aspects, conditions are established for the transparency of accounts and a system of penalties is provided for in order to ensure that they are properly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, it needs to be improved and I am therefore pleased with Mr Jarzembowski’s Amendment 30 which prevents disadvantages for European industry by increasing the number of helicopter passengers. I was not very happy with the presence of definitions of aircraft, but I agree that they should be extended, if they are to be included. In particular, I would like us all to support Amendments 33 and 34, which acknowledge the importance of cabin crew, who are increasingly responsible for our safety, as well as our comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">We must conform to that which was laid down in the EU-OPS Regulation and develop and provide excellent harmonised training, qualifications and professional and medical certification for those cabin crews. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such an extension has become necessary in order to attain a high and uniform level of aviation safety while, at the same time, maintaining the fair conditions for air operators practising in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In the main, the report appears to meet with widespread cross-group approval, and this is to a large extent indicative of the good cooperation achieved by Mr Leichtfried with the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that the most important issue of note concerning this report is the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has voted in favour of a small number of very important amendments to the Commission proposal that give the European Aviation Safety Agency the power to impose fines with periodic penalty payments if safety standards are not implemented properly. Let us not be confused: the fines are intended to be in addition to more drastic measures, such as licence revoking.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the committee voted in favour of establishing adequate protection for informers – whistleblowers – who could provide information on abuses or non-compliance with the legislation. The committee amendments should be given our full support, as they provide sensible and proper practical means of making sure that aviation safety is given the serious attention it deserves by all concerned and that strict compliance with safety rules is effectively achieved. In this respect, the use of the carrot alone is not good enough in some cases. The stick has important uses too.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighteen months ago my country, Cyprus, suffered a major aviation tragedy, leaving 121 people dead. A report into the causes of that incident points towards major flaws in the implementation of aviation safety standards. If this Commission proposal had been in place at the time, I am sure this air disaster could have been avoided. Therefore, let us hope that this proposal, as amended by the Committee on Transport, will quickly be implemented. The sooner this happens, the better it will be for the avoidance of major air disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, every time a new agency comes into being or an agency’s powers are to be extended on the basis of a regulation, we need to ask ourselves whether the number of people and powers is commensurate with the requirements of the organisation concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Common rules in the area of civil aviation are indisputably important. As with the previous regulation, the problem lies in the definition of civil aviation in the field to which the rules relate. There remains a discrepancy between the rules in the United States and those in the EU, not least in the definition of the specifications of the ultralight category. Perhaps the negotiators in the EU and the US will come to this question at a later stage of negotiation and the outcome will be incorporated into an amendment to the new regulation in force in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Agency, I take the view that the proposed number of employees and the budget are inappropriate for fulfilling the task of coordination and control. National testing has hardly been taken into account. I believe that this question will be assessed and handled by the Council. The proposals in question will strengthen the European Air Safety Agency (EASA). I do not support all of them for practical reasons. In particular, I do not welcome the idea of bringing the testing of ultralights under central control.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in particular to mention Amendment 5, regarding which I fail to understand why the Commission’s proposal restricts small aeroplanes with a take-off mass of 5 700 kg to a maximum number of nine passenger seats. This proposal runs counter to the job of developing small aircraft in the CESAR programme, which was adopted more than a year ago by the Commission on the basis of the third challenge laid down by the Sixth Framework Programme on science and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The new amendment lays down 19 seats for passengers pursuant to the proposal in the CESAR programme. As regards the call for the entire air crew, and not just the pilots, to be qualified, the amendments specify the original wording, and for this reason I support them. Unfortunately, the clear removal of the ultralight category from the scope of the EASA has not happened. As Mr Remek said, this refers to all aircraft lighter than 600 kg. It would be appropriate if, in this category of aeroplanes, the control and testing procedures that have been adopted could be applied in such a way that national testing bodies would continue to perform the verifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dossier that we are debating here today is of the utmost importance for the future of European civil aviation, especially in view of the prospect of a constant increase in air traffic over the coming years and of the European Union’s recent commitments on CO2 emissions, which will certainly affect civil aviation as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), we are seeking to ensure that we have the most stringent civil aviation safety regulations, which will also apply to non-EU operators using European airspace and airports. An assessment of the work carried out by the EASA since 2003 makes it very clear, however, that we need to cautiously extend the Agency’s powers in the areas of air operations, pilot licensing and third-country aircraft, but that must not involve any increase in bureaucracy or unlawful obstacles to the normal performance of this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only support these changes if they will in fact help to increase air safety. The inevitable resulting loss of competences by the national aviation authorities is unacceptable unless there is obvious added value in terms of safety management and the future of European civil aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">The common objective that we share thus means giving the EASA the practical powers to carry out the new tasks entrusted to it. Until now, each Member State would, in most cases, adopt its own regulations on the basis of internationally agreed minimum standards, and it is a fact, quite frankly, that Europe’s airspace has always been the safest in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to stress the need to take account of the experience built up by the competent national authorities, so as to ensure that common EU rules are laid down and enforced effectively and that safety is constantly improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into detail – many details have already been mentioned – we can expect that a number of improvements will need to be introduced in several areas, especially as regards greater interaction with the Member States’ aviation authorities. The aim, Madam President, will remain that of providing all passengers flying in European airspace with even greater protection and safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am completely in agreement with him when he says that extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency is an advance for the European Union and for the safety of passengers. Indeed, the Regulation stipulates that third country aircraft will no longer be able to fly in the European Union unless they are certified by the Agency. This text, therefore, brings an improvement in terms of safety. Every aircraft will be inspected and will have to receive certification in order to be authorised to carry passengers in the European Union. It is also an advance in terms of harmonisation of protection for European citizens, which is part, Commissioner, of the extension of the process that was begun with the European black list. This process is intended to allow every passenger to be protected in the same way in every airport in European Community territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to say a word about the way that these new tasks for the European Aviation Safety Agency are to be financed. Amendments proposing levying a tax on plane tickets were tabled in committee. Fortunately, they were rejected. We must stop always wanting to pass on the cost for these measures to passengers. Taxes on plane tickets are already very high and I hope that we will find a way of financing that does not impose a further burden directly on air passengers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments proposed by your rapporteur reinforce the Commission’s objectives in the interests of aviation safety in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts, therefore, 14 of these amendments, which contribute to this objective. In particular I shall mention the two amendments whose purpose is to allow for the benefit and mutual recognition of the certificates to be automatically withdrawn in the event of failure to respect the common rules. I shall also mention the amendment aimed at obliging the European Aviation Safety Agency to communicate to the Commission all information relevant to the updating of the black list. I also noticed that, in your supplementary amendments, Parliament asks for the inclusion of a reference to the medical certificate in Article 6b, paragraph 4. I would like to indicate my agreement with this proposal because it reflects the Commission’s initial proposal. I am referring to Amendment 34 from Mrs Ticău.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think that 15 of the amendments proposed by your rapporteur are not acceptable as they are and deserve to be debated again. Mr Leichtfried and Mr Evans, your Amendment 17 aims to allow the Agency to impose fines, but this amendment does not seem acceptable to us as it stands. I quite understand the interest in imposing fines in the event of very minor breaches and it is true that the tools currently available to the Agency may, in this respect, seem out of proportion. This proposal for an amendment, however interesting it may be, raises a great number of legal, institutional and practical questions. In order to comment on these important and complex questions, the Commission needs to study them carefully. Indeed, we need to be sure that the legislation that would be put in place complies with the Treaty. In the meantime, as you will understand, the Commission cannot accept this amendment although it agrees that it is of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Leichtfried and Mr Evans, it is difficult for us to accept Amendment 27 which seeks to finance part of the certification process by means of Community subsidy. In 2007, these processes will amount to EUR 9 million. That is an expense that grows rapidly by about 5% a year, without inflation, and which cannot therefore be funded within the scope of the current financial perspectives. Furthermore, this amendment would result in charging taxpayers instead of the businessmen who receive or have received benefits in terms of marketing the products concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Several amendments, specifically Amendments 30, 31 and 33, have also just been tabled concerning EU-OPS. As you know, this has been the subject of long and heated debates which finally resulted, last year, in a compromise that was broadly accepted by the three institutions. This compromise  Regulation (CE) No 1899/2006  makes provision for its own development. I do not think it is reasonable right now to try to call it into question. I shall ask, therefore, for you to confine yourselves to the amendment voted for in the Committee on Transport and Tourism as well as Amendment 34, which I can support. There, then, are a few points that deserve still to be debated, and which also call for some further information<a href="#def_26_1" name="ref_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Mr Janowski, the Commission is always seeking the agreement of Member States and of the European Parliament in order to be able to contribute to international organisations on behalf of the Community. I thank the European Parliament for its support. Unfortunately, the Member States have not quite reached the point of understanding the importance of the presence of the Commission and of the Union within international institutions such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Remek raised the problem of light aircraft, which also operate commercially and can reach high speeds. They fly in the same airspace as other planes. It is appropriate for them to be subject to safety rules, although lighter ones, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question, which I have already answered, concerns the Agency’s capacity to carry out these new competences. It may be said that the Agency has the material and human resources necessary to fulfil these tasks. At the end of 2006, that is scarcely four years after it was set up, it had a staff of 280 agents and in the financial statement attached to the proposal before you, provision is made for 330 agents at the end of 2007. That being so, it is true that the Agency’s financial resources pose a problem as, of course, it has to be funded partly by subsidies but also by the fees paid by airline operators who are applying for certification for their aircraft. It is a difficult problem, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, and we shall certainly have the opportunity to return to it because, there too we shall have to find a budget that can remain fairly constant. I shall speak about it again with the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Veyrac reminded us of all the advances that we have made and in which Parliament has really distinguished itself. Does that mean though that this legislation would make the black list redundant? No, because the black list is a repressive tool whose aim is to ban bad carriers from European skies. Prior authorisation to operate in the Community granted to third-country transporters will be a preventive tool intended to guarantee that only companies with an appropriate safety level will be able to fly into the Community. These two pieces of legislation are complementary and one can imagine that one day, indeed, as a result of prevention, repression will lose its usefulness. We are not there yet, but I am just expressing a wish.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, Madam President, while apologising for, no doubt, failing to reply to all the questions asked, to say how grateful I am to the European Parliament for helping us in this way to gradually provide the European Union with legislation for monitoring the safety of aircraft, of air transport, which, in my opinion, will be one of the most effective in the world. We want a European sky that is safe; it is very important for our fellow citizens who will be called upon more and more to use air transport and who, of course, demand proper protection against all safety risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you and again I thank the whole of Parliament for its valuable contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can only support the publication of this report as a result of our having identified, during the five years since the establishment of the Aviation Security Agency, the areas in which regulations need to be modified or perhaps refined, or, on the contrary, where the agency’s scope needs to be expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has sought and has provided answers to these questions. The fact that the Agency’s scope of competences will in the future extend to pilot licensing, air operations, third country aircraft, collective oversight, etc., means that the safety of air transport can only increase; for in these kinds of activities, central procedures can be much more effective than if different regulations were in force within each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no less important that the Agency be prepared to face the challenges of the future, in order to be able to guarantee aviation safety over the long term. We need also to meet the challenges of providing appropriate financing for this purpose. In my opinion, the report takes a significant step forward in this direction as well.</p>

For quite some time now, this committee has been dealing with the issue of reprehensible hunting of birds on Malta. We have received a petition from a number of bird protection associations with a combined membership of several hundred thousand individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">This hunting activity is reprehensible for three reasons. Firstly, because it takes place in the spring. Secondly, because traps are used. Thirdly, because it is done from motorboats on the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">There is very strong opposition to the hunting and the Committee on Petitions has recently received two thick volumes detailing the latest infringements of the principles on which hunting is supposed to be conducted. As you can see, there is a photograph of an osprey on the cover. The osprey is an endangered bird in Europe, yet it is being hunted and killed in Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that the hunting expeditions described only target migrating birds. This is because no birds spend any length of time on Malta. These are all birds that fly enormous distances, often from southern Africa up to northern Europe or back. They land on Malta simply to rest a short while, only to die at the hands of the hunters.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have ascertained that most of the inhabitants of Malta are opposed to this hunting. The Committee on Petitions undertook a special fact finding mission to Malta last year to report on the situation. We formed the impression that only a small proportion of the population is involved in hunting. These people are, however, drawn from many different political parties and therefore enjoy the support of various politicians on both sides of the political divide. This means that although the hunting fraternity is only a small minority, it is in a strong position because it knows all the political parties will protect its interests. In other words, all the parties are prepared to back these hunters who are intent on killing birds.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learnt recently that the government now wishes to grant licences for spring hunting once again. It is the spring hunts that have the most detrimental effect on Malta’s bird population, and in fact on the bird population of the whole of Europe because migratory birds are involved, as I said earlier. The repercussions are felt by bird populations across the whole continent. Malta is actually the least affected as no birds are permanently resident there.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I have addressed a question to the European Commission. The substance of the question is as follows. Despite the fact that the Commission has opened proceedings against Malta for failing to meet its obligations and despite the recommendation made by the Committee on Petitions following its fact finding mission in May of last year, the Government of Malta is preparing to award licences for hunting wild birds in the spring of 2007. This is consistent with the practice adopted by Malta every year since its accession to the European Union in 2004. The question is: what urgent action does the European Commission intend to take to convince the Maltese authorities to impose an effective ban on hunting wild birds, especially in the spring migration season? It should be remembered that many of these birds are threatened with extinction, including predators such as the osprey. How does the Commission intend to oblige the Government of Malta to honour the commitments it entered into? How does it intend to ensure that the directive on wild birds is adopted and suitably implemented in Malta?</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to your response, Commissioner, as does the Committee on Petitions and indeed the whole House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a question of compliance with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the conservation of wild birds clearly bans the hunting of migratory birds returning to their rearing grounds, as contained in Annex ΙΙ to the directive. As Mr Libicki also said, this spring hunting is the worst form of hunting.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9 of the directive makes provision for the facility for derogation on the part of the Member States. Nonetheless, this facility only applies under exceptional circumstances, subject to compliance with the very strict criteria laid down in that article. In such cases, there is basically only a facility to derogate if there is no other satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the Maltese Government decided to exercise the right to apply a derogation for hunting quail and turtle doves during their spring migration. Nonetheless, according to information passed to the Commission by the Maltese authorities, the derogation in question does not appear to comply with the preconditions laid down in the Birds Directive. More importantly, the Maltese authorities were unable to substantiate that there was no other satisfactory solution or that spring hunting was being carried out under conditions of strict surveillance. For these reasons, the Commission came to the conclusion that the derogation for 2004 was in breach of Articles 7 and 9 of the Birds Directive. In July 2006, infringement proceedings were started in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty and the Commission has not yet received an official response from the Maltese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter under discussion concerns the derogation for the year 2004. Nonetheless, the Commission knows that Malta allowed spring hunting during the following years also, in other words in 2005 and 2006, and it would appear that it allowed it during this year, in 2007. The continuation of spring hunting in all these years, in breach of legislation, constitutes a systematic case of poor application of the Birds Directive. For this reason, in order to extend the subject of the current infringement proceedings, we intend to send the Maltese authorities a supplementary warning letter about what is now standard practice on the part of the Maltese authorities over the years since 2004. The Commission decision is expected to be taken at its meeting on 21 March. If Malta does not comply with the Birds Directive, the Commission will pursue the legal proceedings provided for to the end. Despite this, we have not yet reached this stage and I still hope that the Maltese authorities will comply with Community legislation. Within the limits of its competence, the Commission is taking and will continue to take the necessary measures, so that Malta, like every other Member State, complies with the Birds Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, here in front of me I have the document dated 27 September 2002, proving this. The Commission is well aware that the negotiations with Malta were not easy because the decision on whether or not Malta should accede was one that concerned the whole country, yet, even so, Malta did not pursue its right to a derogation capriciously. I do not, therefore, expect the Commissioner to come here and say, on the first occasion that Malta applies to make use of its derogation, ‘now you cannot use it’. How can the Commission have accepted in writing the use of a derogation during the negotiations and then, the first time it is to be used, say that this is not allowed? Moreover, how can the Commission say that there are alternatives to spring hunting? Why was this not said during the negotiations? These are the answers we expect from you, Commissioner. </p>
<p class="contents">I thoroughly agree with you that this derogation does not give hunters free rein, and I would like to inform you of a few measures that Malta is taking to deal with those who violate the hunting rules. First of all, only two species are allowed to be hunted in the spring. Before Malta’s accession, 32 species were allowed to be hunted at that time of year; so we have reduced the number from thirty-two to two. Secondly, the spring hunting season has been shortened by 18 days. The third and most important point is that the penalties for those who break the rules have been increased to a fine of € 14 000, two years imprisonment and the permanent confiscation of hunting licences for repeat offenders; in other words, the second time round they are shown the red flag and sent off. I hope that the Commission acknowledges that these are positive steps forward. Unfortunately, the Commissioner has made no reference to them.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us condemn abuse of the rules, but those who do not break the rules should not be placed in the same camp as offenders. That is why I am opposed to those who, at the other extreme entirely, would like to ban hunting altogether. Moreover, and to conclude, the Commission must be careful, despite intense political pressure, not to ignore what was agreed on during the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This really is an international problem. In Malta, thousands of migratory birds are shot dead or captured every year. This is particularly bad since Malta is one of the few resting places for migratory birds when they cross the Mediterranean. After all, what is the use of European countries investing money and energy in protective measures in the framework of the Habitat and Bird Directive if those self-same birds are shot dead on their journey in other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">To my Maltese opposite numbers, I should like to say that, although it is true that Malta has acquired, until 2008, a number of transitional measures in the accession treaty, these measures only pertain to the capture of birds with a view to breeding them for the purpose of preserving the species. These amount, in other words, to animal protection measures. Under no circumstances does this transitional measure allow for migratory bird hunting in the spring. In its notification, the Commission has made it clear that Malta is, in this case, riding roughshod over the Bird Directive, and that exceptions cannot be made for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Mr Libicki’s report of June 2006 of the inquiry task force of the Committee on Petitions denounces the way in which migratory birds are hunted down on a large scale, and concludes that the derogation from the Bird Directive, which Malta decided on off its own bat, should lapse. I therefore think that it is of the utmost importance for this House to support the Commission in the procedure and to convince Malta to respect the Birds Directive and therefore not allow migratory bird hunting to take place this spring. This case could, in fact, prove vital should the Birds Directive be found to be being infringed elsewhere in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are practically in the spring and hunting is still going on in Malta. Illegal hunters have taken over a significant portion of the country’s territory. The Directive on wild birds is blatantly being violated while the Maltese authorities remain entirely passive.</p>
<p class="contents">The hunters, protected by the government, are even resorting to violence. Three Maltese journalists have been hospitalised after being brutally attacked by hunters while simply doing their jobs alongside people who were protesting against this illegal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the majority of Maltese society is opposed to spring hunting. According to a recent poll, more than 80% of Maltese people are against this illegal practice. Even Malta’s hotel and restaurant owners are against it, because they say that it is bad for tourism and bad for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Maltese Government determined to protect this illegal and barbaric practice? Only the Maltese 'Democratic Alternative’ party – the Greens – is defending Community law in Malta. The Maltese Government is demonstrating a scandalous lack of adherence to the European Treaty that it signed very recently, before joining the European Union. How can that be?</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Commission to act firmly and decisively in the face of this challenge to Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It suggests that an agreement already approved by the European Union, this Parliament and the Maltese people in a referendum and general election should be broken. This resolution has implications beyond support for, or opposition to, hunting because, if it goes through, we will then be sending out the message to all Europeans that the European Union does not keep its word. Resolutions of this kind undermine the credibility of the European institutions. What guarantee do we have, as Maltese, that the European Union will keep its word regarding the rest of the negotiations? What guarantee does any European have that the European Union will continue to honour the outcome of the negotiations carried out with his or her country? </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s political groups have every right to put forward their agendas. However, this has to take place within the correct parameters, and no agreement can be broken for the simple reason that there are some people with different political agendas. If there is anyone opposed to illegal hunting, that person is myself. I am also the first to condemn the violent acts that took place in the protest march in Malta. However, if we are going to talk about barbaric acts committed in European Union countries, I need only mention what goes on in Spain or Italy, which are examples of countries elsewhere in the European Union in which illegal hunting takes place. I therefore say, let us fight illegal hunting in the European Union by all means, but let us fight it in the whole of the European Union and not just pick on Malta. </p>
<p class="contents">What was promised to us during the negotiations must remain valid, and I urge all my fellow Members, including those who are not members of my political group, to commit themselves to protecting that which, by right, belongs to the European citizen. I would like to quote my fellow Member, Mr Schultz, Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who, this very morning, albeit in a different context, stated that we must honour every agreement that we sign. This must also apply in Malta’s case. We must therefore respect what was agreed on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also agree that the authorities’ duty is to ensure that these directives and laws are observed by everyone, and we cannot in any way condone the practice of illegal hunting. To this end, one of the amendments proposed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requests a more transparent approach and proposes that the Commission and the Maltese Government publish their technical positions on the subject, including the minutes of the decisions taken in meetings that have taken place or that will take place. </p>
<p class="contents">This becomes more relevant if one recalls that, before Malta’s accession to the European Union, the Maltese Government had stated that, together with the European Commission, it had negotiated a derogation regarding the issue of spring hunting. Although other political forces and the civil society sector had expressed serious concerns regarding the Maltese government’s interpretation of the use of this derogation, the European Commission chose, for reasons known only to itself, to keep silent and adopt an ambiguous stance. Unfortunately, this has only added to further confusion over the matter. Had there, at the time, been more transparency on both sides, this would have led to less ambivalence and less likelihood of Maltese society being unjustly burdened with financial repercussions. This is also a credibility issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental regulations have to conform to the directives of the European Union and to the terms of the accession treaty. This is clear and we, for our part, have been stressing this for a long time. The Maltese Government, I repeat, has misled the people. </p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, before you nod in agreement, it must be said that the blame is partly yours. Before the referendum took place, when the Maltese Government went around proclaiming loudly that it had an agreement with you regarding spring hunting, you chose to keep quiet. When the Labour Party, ourselves and a few environmentalist and hunting associations expressed doubts about this so-called achievement, you remained silent – although many of you had been to Malta. The least the Maltese government and the Commission can do now is to publish their technical positions because it is not enough simply to claim that everything that was discussed was made public. There are certain documents that, up to this day, we cannot find, search as we may. There are references to them, but it is like trying to tackle an enormous maze. These documents must be made available to everyone, and the minutes of every meeting, past and future, must be published, including those of the recent meeting in Brussels, from which everyone emerged claiming victory. I simply cannot understand how everybody can emerge victorious from the same meeting. Ultimately, however, if these minutes are not published, then those who have been misleading people will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fellow Members from the other party are claiming that there is a letter stating that the government can make use of a derogation. It is therefore little wonder that everybody is feeling rather confused, considering that we are only a handful of people in this House and yet we cannot agree on the facts. As my two colleagues in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament pointed out, there is a need for more transparency and, at the very least, a need to agree on the facts. The problem is that, in actual fact, there is ambiguity and confusion. However, this was not caused accidentally. Rather, I believe that this state of affairs has remained muddled because, although, for hunters and trappers, hunting is a passion and, for BirdLife Malta, it is the subject of a mission, at the end of the day it is a political issue. It is about who will get the votes from those sectors that could actually decide the outcome of a referendum or a general election. Like my fellow Members who spoke before me, I therefore ask that the facts of the negotiation agreements between Malta and Europe be set out and explained as clearly as possible and in such a way that all the parties involved are aware of them. To conclude, I would like to say that, if we cannot even agree on the facts, there is little hope of our agreeing on a solution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that it is impossible that the honourable members do not know the answers to the questions they have already asked. They know that whatever has been agreed for the integration of countries into the European Union is public knowledge. There are no secret agreements and I am certain that the honourable members know this full well, because they have been in the European Parliament for two years now. Consequently, I cannot understand exactly what these secret documents are. There is no mystery here. Everything that has been agreed is public knowledge. For Malta it was agreed that there would be a transitional period on the question of bird trapping. There is no agreement on anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the derogations are concerned, the right to request a derogation is granted in Article 9 to all the Member States. Malta too can request a derogation under the provisions of Article 9. Malta did not request a derogation, it simply made a derogation on its own, we took it to Court and we have been waiting for it to respond since July 2006. It has still not sent us a reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission welcomes the active intervention of Parliament's Committee on Petitions. The visit by the members of the Committee on Petitions to Malta in May 2006 was fruitful and the report on the visit confirms that, in this instance, the Commission and the European Parliament are of the same opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission used the infringement procedure because the Maltese authorities are still allowing spring hunting, in breach of Community legislation. Malta is clearly behaving in breach. It started with the derogation in the 2004 hunting season and continued in subsequent years and, to all appearances, it is continuing this year.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, the priority is to prevent systematic and generalised infringement of Community legislation on birds. That is why we intend – as I said earlier – to extend the existing infringement proceedings pending for the 2004 case to the general infringing practices of Malta. In this way, we shall be in a position to address and prevent future infringements; this will happen at the Commission meeting on 21 March.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the present situation is concerned, on 28, 29 and 30 March a Commission delegation will travel to Malta to discuss the case in greater detail. Explanations will be requested from the competent national authorities and it will be made clear to them that they must comply with Community legislation without delay. If the Maltese authorities stick to their guns, the Commission will proceed to the next state of the procedure, which is to issue a reasoned opinion, and it will be able to take recourse to the Court of Justice straight afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure which the Commission can follow – for any case, I am not just talking about Malta – is, within the framework of the main referral and, once the reasoned opinion has been issued in accordance with Article 228, to seek an injunction ordering the Member State to stop its infringing behaviour. The Court may issue an injunction if it finds that there is an urgent need to prevent irreparable damage as a result of blatant infringement of Community law for which there is prima facie evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">In Malta's case, the Commission would have been unable to seek an injunction before now, without first extending – as I said earlier it was going to do – the subject of the 2004 case so that it also covered subsequent years (2005, 2006 and, possibly, 2007). The Court would have dismissed the request, given that the risk of irreparable damage would already have passed. The application for an injunction would have been dead letter, given that it would have only referred to the infringement in 2004. It is for precisely this reason – from a legal point of view and in order to prevent future infringements – that we felt it advisable that the current proceedings should be extended at the Commission meeting on 21 March.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that, with the visit by senior officials from the Environment DG, the Maltese authorities will be persuaded to comply fully with the provisions of Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
