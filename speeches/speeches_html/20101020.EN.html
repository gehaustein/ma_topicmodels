It was clear during the debate that the report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) had not been received by the relevant services. We checked the issue. The report was completed and sent properly, so probably some mistakes occurred during the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not important to find who is responsible and what happened exactly. What is most important is that we wish to be sure that our report, which was also our base for the trialogue, and where the biggest difference lay as compared with the Council paper, is sent to the Council official documents. I therefore brought it with me and deliver it to you, as well as to the Council. We kindly ask you to make sure that the proposal by the ITRE Committee, which was adopted unanimously, will arrive at the Council in due time. Thank you very much for your support in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This European Council will have a busy agenda. Its focal point will, without doubt, be economic governance. As you are aware, the task force chaired by President Van Rompuy met on Monday and approved its final report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains important and specific recommendations and proposals that should enable us to make a qualitative leap in European economic governance. In particular, its recommendations seek to improve fiscal discipline, broaden economic monitoring, develop and broaden coordination, strengthen the crisis management framework and strengthen institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">All these recommendations can be implemented quickly through legislation. Naturally, we hope the European Council will be able to endorse them in order to enable the Commission, Parliament and the Council to make swift progress on these highly important matters. This would, in any case, send a positive signal as to our intention to take the measures necessary to address the important economic challenge ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that some people have raised the issue of exploring other options that go further than these recommendations and beyond the scope of the treaties. I am talking here about issues such as suspending voting rights or introducing new voting rules such as reverse majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, these are not easy issues, either technically or politically. They will be discussed at the European Council next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important item on the European Council’s agenda is the preparations for the G20 summit. Indeed, the European Council shall have to define the Union’s position on the basis of the preparatory work carried out yesterday by the ECOFIN Council. Generally speaking, it is important for the Seoul G20 summit to mark a speeding up of the efforts to implement the framework laid down for promoting stronger, more sustainable and more balanced growth. In particular, we need to address the major global economic imbalances which can compromise growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2008, with the onset of the crisis and the measures taken to deal with it – in other words, since the G20’s long-awaited rise to prominence – things have changed radically. The reason is very simple: relevance. The very nature of many decisions that have direct consequences for our fellow citizens has shifted within the space of a few months from the local or national level to the international level. Globalisation means that we now have to act simultaneously at European level and at international level on most issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the European Union needed time to reach an agreement on a new treaty that was also meant to strengthen the Union’s role on the international stage. It took us the best part of the last 10 years to deliver this treaty but only the last 10 months to realise how important it is.</p>
<p class="contents">The G20 has proved somewhat successful since its inception, but I believe that the hardest and most important test is the one awaiting it in the next few weeks and months, when we will have to confront the serious risk of losing momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is currently preparing two important meetings, both in Korea, the first in two days’ time. This is the meeting of G20 finance ministers and governors of central banks, and the second one is the G20 summit in mid-November.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of substance, the Union’s contribution to strong, sustainable and balanced growth is based on: 1) growth-friendly and differentiated fiscal consolidation plans; 2) the Europe 2020 strategy for structural reforms necessary for supporting, among other things, job creation; 3) the programme for reforming the financial sector and markets; and 4) the strengthening of the Union’s economic governance. On this last point, we could present the findings of the task force at the November summit, once they have been adopted by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the European Union is very interested in the peer review process within the G20. As Europeans, we are used to this type of exercise and we know how interesting and useful it can be. Clearly, everyone must play his or her part and show a genuine willingness to contribute to the framework for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The war against protectionism is not won in a single battle but by maintaining a general state of alert, day after day. For the rest, although the work of the technical bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board chaired by Mario Draghi, is progressing well, and overall integration, particularly in certain areas, is, in my opinion, going in the right direction, it is also important to carry out a long-term reform of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europeans are ready to honour past commitments, particularly those made last year in Pittsburgh, to ensure that the new IMF is more representative of the new international economic reality and hence, that emerging economies play a bigger role and have more of a voice. However, let me be clear on this: Europe cannot be expected to make all the concessions in this regard on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">All developed countries must contribute. We have already made known what we are specifically willing to negotiate on, in terms of representation, governance and share of the vote. We believe this is a good basis for reaching a compromise. So, let no one blame Europe if nothing changes in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Union, we have negotiated among ourselves on all this and on a number of key issues and terms of reference for the G20 finance ministers’ meeting, which is due to take place this week. We have done so to ensure that Europeans not only speak with one voice but also focus on defending and promoting that which represents their most important interests. The Presidency and the Commission will do everything in their power to defend and support these interests resulting from our common position, which is the fruit of several months’ work by all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to climate change, in theory, the intention is not to have a detailed discussion at the European Council, since the Environment Council already adopted, on 14 October, a very comprehensive text with conclusions establishing the European position. It is becoming ever more urgent to progress with the implementation of an ambitious scheme for combating climate change after 2012, and to that end, the European Union continues to defend a step-by-step approach which is based on the Kyoto Protocol and the results of the Copenhagen conference and which paves the way for a comprehensive and legally binding global framework, by taking into account the political guidelines outlined in the final Copenhagen document.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cancún conference must achieve a balanced result which addresses the parties’ concerns and enables us to establish the progress made up to now. The Union has expressed its preference for one legally binding instrument which would encompass the main elements of the Kyoto Protocol. It could, however, envisage a second period of commitment under the Kyoto Protocol on several conditions. This should take place within the context of a broader agreement to which all the major economies would subscribe and which would embody the ambition and effectiveness of international action and would fulfil the urgent need to protect environmental integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to mention the preparation of the European Union’s position in view of the summits with the United States, Russia and Ukraine. This will be the first time that the preparations for the summits with the Union’s key partners have been discussed by Heads of State or Government, in line with the conclusions of the European Council of 16 September. The idea is for the Heads of State or Government to have an open debate on the main challenges in our relations with our partners. Without wanting to anticipate this debate, let me briefly expand on the key issues of these forthcoming summits.</p>
<p class="contents">It will certainly be important to focus the summit with the United States on a few key issues. Generally speaking, it will have to mark a strengthening of transatlantic cooperation, which is a fundamental vehicle for devising effective solutions to the common challenges ahead of us. Furthermore, the day after the G20 summit, the Europe-United States summit will represent an important opportunity for taking these results on board and developing a common approach to several current economic issues. We should also seek to develop a common approach in relation to the emerging economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit should also – at least we hope – make it possible to revive the Transatlantic Economic Council by turning it into an economic forum that goes far beyond purely regulatory issues. The Council could usefully examine ways in which to tackle the crisis and to promote growth and jobs, on the basis of a strengthened mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to use the summit to prepare for Cancún, and we are obviously expecting an important positive signal from our US partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, important foreign policy issues will also be on the agenda, notably with regard to Sudan and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the summit with Ukraine, another debate is planned this afternoon with the High Representative, so you will forgive me if I do not say any more on this matter this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit with Russia, the European Union intends to express its full support for the partnership for modernisation, which will enable us to strengthen our cooperation in all areas, particularly in key areas such as innovation and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Those, Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, are the main points due to be discussed at next week’s European Council: a busy and important agenda indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, today, we are debating first of all the issues that will be addressed next week by the European Council. I will concentrate on what I believe are the most important topics: economic governance in the European Union, of course, and externally – apart from the very important summit with the US and also the summit with Russia – what I believe are the critical summits: the summit in Seoul of the G20 and also the Cancún conference on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of our economic governance is a cornerstone of our sustainable recovery and our credibility. This is why the Commission has taken a very ambitious approach since the beginning of these discussions. The proposals submitted by the Commission last month seek to translate the urgency deriving from the crisis into an ambitious legal reality. They tackle the key issues of giving the European Union real clout in economic policy through adequate coordinated fiscal surveillance and addressing macro-economic imbalances, so, as we have very often said, now creating a real economic Union in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the attention that this Parliament is paying to these proposals. An early first reading agreement would prove that the European Union is committed to putting its new vision into action. We should look to have these rules in place by the middle of next year. I therefore urge Member States to go all the way towards these important goals and to pursue this agenda as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, by now, moved towards a stronger consensus on key areas for action, reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact and dealing with macro-economic imbalances, thanks also to the proceedings of the task force under the Presidency of Herman Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">Once all discussions are finished and all decisions are taken, the result of this combined process should be a vision for economic governance which will be much more comprehensive, much more attuned to the need to prevent problems in the first place, and much more solidly based through the use of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me be clear. The overall result must represent a real change from the current situation. We must show to our citizens that the European Union has been drawing all the conclusions and the lessons from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Some other matters still need to be settled. One issue of particular importance is how to replace the current crisis mechanism agreed in May with a mechanism of a more permanent nature once it comes to its end in 2013. We will do everything to avoid facing such crises ever again, but we will also do all we can to be better prepared for critical developments than we were last time. Preparedness and the presence of a robust and permanent crisis mechanism can prevent such developments from arising in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes good note of the views expressed by Member States that favour a treaty change, for which, as everyone knows, the unanimity of Member States is required. At this stage, the Commission will concentrate on the substance. By this, we mean the design of a permanent mechanism that can provide defence in critical moments, whilst minimising moral hazard and making sure that such an instrument will only be used as a last resort in the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">If and when realised in full, the result of all this work will be what we need: a system that provides incentives for Member States to conduct sound economic and fiscal policies, and a system that provides incentives for investors to observe responsible lending practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I believe we are on track. We have been learning lessons from the crisis. For the sake of its citizens, the European Union is putting in place a system of governance that is completely renewed when compared with the state of play before the crisis, and now we are putting all this system on a much sounder footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our track record on economic governance, but also on Europe 2020 and financial regulation, will give us the right platform to go forward to the G20 in Seoul. This summit comes at a critical time. It will be a real test of whether the G20 can deliver the coordination the world economy needs through cooperative solutions at global level. I believe it can, and I believe that the European Union will play a key role in making Seoul a success.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we want to achieve in Seoul? First, we need to remind ourselves that the G20 did play an important role in addressing the crisis. It did so through acting collectively, and as we move into a new phase, we need to continue to act collectively, cooperatively. That means accepting that global imbalances are a concern for all and that all major economies play a part in finding the solution. And yes, we cannot ignore the reality that exchange rates are an important factor here.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we need to see action on the international financial institutions as well. IMF reform, in particular, is overdue. We need others to match the flexibility the European Union has already shown.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, with the support of this Parliament, we are in the midst of a fundamental reform of our own financial system, and once again, I want to thank you for the emphasis you have put on the need to achieve this as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to keep up the momentum on the G20 as well. Progress has been good, but now we have to be sure that it carries through into implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I want the financial sector to play a part in this. That is why the European Union should remain committed to push for a financial transaction tax at global level. In the meantime, the Commission wants to explore other ways of ensuring that the financial sector makes an equitable contribution at European level, such as the financial activities tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The next G20 will also include development as an agenda item for the first time. A multi-year action plan will be adopted to guide our common effort in this area. The Commission has, from the beginning, been a strong supporter of this idea, together with the Korean chair. We need to show that the G20 growth agenda also encompasses and benefits developing countries. At the same time, we want to engage emerging economies in an international development framework which is in line with key principles of development policy and allows for greater coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, when I spoke here in Strasbourg with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, he specifically mentioned this point to me and he was very grateful for the support of the European Union for this agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the G20 needs to take a lead in pushing ahead the trade agenda. Far from being an alternative to the WTO, our agreement with Korea should inspire our partners to push ahead to a rapid conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations by seizing the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the run-up to Cancún, I want to say a word about this very important conference. We need to stay focused on our goals here, to be ambitious for Europe, and also ambitious for the world. We need to move the international process forward. This is not easy. We know that in some of our key partners, the pace of change has slowed rather than accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that in the meantime, we are putting in place the most concrete and effective system for cutting emissions in the world. This is our strongest card and the closer we get to implementing the new Emissions Trading System, the stronger it gets. We have credibility second to none, grounded in a strong consensus between this Parliament, Member States and the Commission on what we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When we get to Cancún, let us not be distracted by arguments about form. We should go into the UN process with plenty of confidence and determination. Cancún will not be the end of the story, the final breakthrough, but it can be a very important step on the road. The EU needs to convey a clear and consistent message in order to move the negotiations forward. We should aim at a set of concrete action-oriented measures which can deliver confidence and trust in the process and bring us closer to our final goal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I wrote to the Members of the European Council last week. I set out what I believe to be a balanced, realistic position – one which continues to drive us forward without creating unrealistic expectations. This is a time for Europe to take the lead by setting out how Cancún can make a series of important steps forward, delivering on important commitments like the fast-start finance and, above all, by making clear that we are continuing to set an example.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union economy will grow more this year than previously foreseen, but recovery is not yet firmly established; there is no room for complacency, as we have said several times, particularly when one sees the still very high figures for unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that we have faced real challenges in the past months as expressed in a clear way in the report that you are going to discuss now from Mrs Berès. I welcome the ambition and large consensus in this House on these important issues, but we all know that this is a time when unemployment is hitting hard, when public spending is being squeezed. Our citizens show their concerns and we must take them into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, however, know that we have been able to find answers as the European Union. We have proposed some important pieces of legislation on economic governance. We have come forward with Europe 2020. That is, I want to remind you of that point, a strategy for growth because growth – smart, inclusive sustainable growth – is the answer. These concerns are also echoed in the excellent report by Mr Feio.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed a wide range of financial market regulation measures. Let me welcome the agreement of the legislator on our proposals on financial supervision. The reality is that if most observers were asked two years ago whether the European Union was ready to have a European supervisory system, most would say ‘no, it is not possible’. Now we have shown that this is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pursuing a holistic approach to covering the different dimensions involved. Let me therefore also underline the agreement reached yesterday by the Council on the Commission’s proposal on hedge funds. I hope that this position can now lead to conclusive negotiations in the European Parliament so that the European Union can finally benefit from this long-awaited regulation and, once again, we will be in a position of leadership on that matter in Seoul.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also making progress in other areas because we have to look at the real economy. Let me also congratulate this House for the work in favour of a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. The directive will give better protection to creditors, in most cases SMEs, while respecting the freedom of contract. Public authorities will have to pay within 30 days or else pay an interest rate of 8%. You know how much this regulation is awaited by SMEs that remain the most important sector of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work is not yet complete. All proposals need to be carried through to their end, but they are starting to show their results. The objective is to get us out of the crisis and through recovery, achieving again the growth rates that create employment and make sure that our social market economy will be fit for the 21st century. Many thanks for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to do something about it. It will result in an 11% unemployment rate in our European Union by the end of the year. It is unfolding against the backdrop of a new currency war, caused by the risk of a double-dip recession, in the words of our economists.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, I have sensed the feeling, in this House, that it is our duty to send a strong message to the other institutions, to the Commission and the Council, to say that we must join forces again around the added value of the European project, and that the issue at stake can be summarised in a few words: we have a collective responsibility and we need to implement an EU-wide strategy that will enable us, in the area of energy, to be strong on the inside and thus, strong on the outside. We must count on our own strength and, to do so, we need the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Barroso, to our mind, economic governance is not a vision. It is a means of furthering this strategy, and it is on the basis of this strategy that we decide which resources are needed. These are, first and foremost, financial resources. There is the challenge of bringing the review of the financial perspective into line with this focus on a strategy for a European energy community. There is the need to harness a proposal that you are rejecting: the taxing of financial transactions. There is the need to grant a substantial European loan to finance long-term investments. There is the need to restore the balance of taxation in Europe so that it promotes work and jobs instead of capital, and so that it is environmentally friendly. There is the need to coordinate the Member States’ budgets with the European project so that efforts are aimed in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of governance, we suggest appointing a ‘Mr Euro’ to ensure harmonious and balanced economic governance. We also suggest not focusing exclusively on the situation of countries in debt but balancing it with an assessment of countries in surplus. Moreover, we suggest that, in a monetary union, debt should also be managed in common and that we should be able to envisage mutual debt issuance. We would like financial reform, which you are working so hard to achieve Mr Barroso, to focus on the needs of Europeans and not only on financial stability objectives. We want to see the financial markets reformed in a way that revives the notions of ethics and moral values, that aids job creation and long-term investments.</p>
<p class="contents">No European project can succeed if it is not backed by the Member States. The only way for the European Union to show the best it can do is to make the Member States want to support it. A debate that is focused solely on the drudgery of imposing sanctions will not make Europeans want to get involved again with their Member States in the project. What we are asking for is strong action based on the added value of the European project so that we can lift Europeans out of this recession and ensure that, in the future, everyone in Europe has a job, is out of poverty, and can once again have faith in the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">That is our ambition. I hope, Mr Barroso, that you will be able to share it and take up many of the suggestions that we are making here, on behalf of this entire House.</p>

Representatives of the Council, I should like to start by thanking everyone who has worked on this report and made it possible, especially all the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I had the opportunity to exchange opinions and build consensus. Consensus building was often difficult, with several tendencies within Parliament: from left to right, advocates of more sovereignty or a more modern type of sovereignty, and advocates of certain institutions. So many opinions were given, but they were given with one goal in mind: that of finding solutions to the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis demonstrated that Europe did not respond in time and often did not respond well. The crisis showed that many governments within the European Union were still upholding a policy that was not based on the true facts. It is for precisely that reason that solutions are necessary, and the European Parliament must put forward these solutions with an appropriate and firm voice. Some of these solutions will be short- and others long-term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are essentially tabling eight recommendations. The idea of multilateral surveillance of macro-economic developments in the Union and in the Member States is being tabled, so as to better achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, to achieve a Europe of growth, and to strengthen a pact that is about stability, but also about growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposals are also being made to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact and look in particular detail at what is going on regarding debt, to enhance economic governance in the euro area by the Euro Group, and to establish a robust and credible excessive debt prevention and resolution mechanism for the euro area, which could involve establishing a European Monetary Fund. The ideas of reviewing the EU budgetary, financial and fiscal instruments, of financial market regulation and supervision with a clear macro-economic dimension, and of improving the reliability of EU statistics, have also been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it has been suggested to better represent the Union in the area of economic and monetary affairs. Parliament is demonstrating or could demonstrate a firm voice on all these issues. We are aiming for better institutional coordination between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. We can contribute to this solution being able to provide better solutions to future crisis situations or difficulties. From now on, Europe has the instruments to respond better in the field of economics; Parliament contributed greatly to this and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently starting a legislative debate on six proposals that have been tabled by the Commission and, regarding which, I believe Parliament will maintain its own position. It is for this very reason that I would also express my surprise that there was no mention of Parliament’s position and the dialogue that this House had with the Council in a recent Council document tabled just yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would finish by saying one thing: the European Parliament has its own positions, irrespective of our differences. The European Parliament is committed to a strong Europe and better economic governance, with more growth and better prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first was the need to be serious about sanctioning Member States that breach the Stability Pact. Just a couple of days ago, the French Prime Minister and the German Chancellor even agreed to change the treaty to bring in tougher sanctions against countries that threaten the euro’s stability. I also emphasised the need to prioritise spending in the budget in case a Member State has to be rescued. Finally, I raised awareness about the need to evaluate the impact on the credit rating of the European Union since it acted as guarantor of the European financial stabilisation mechanism.</p>

This is reflected in the new supervision package which allows for certain systematic risks to be identified and for this to be done in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, when it comes to the concept of economic governance, nobody can deny that there is still a long way to go. Any Member State that ignores its obligations and responsibilities, particularly with respect to the Growth and Stability Pact, creates serious problems for other Member States. Therefore, we are obliged to do our utmost to encourage serious observation of the rules that were agreed upon so as to guarantee stability within the Member States, both financially and physically.</p>

The crisis has made all the more pressing the need to strengthen the single market, taking into account the proposals of Mr Monti and Mr Grech. It is essential to develop <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and transnational trade, simplify online payment procedures, standardise products and services, and harmonise fiscal instruments, so as to reinforce consumer confidence and boost the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must emerge from the crisis in a way that is sustainable, guaranteeing robust growth and responsible budgets, but also employment objectives. It should be mandatory for indicators such as the unemployment rate and the rate of employment among the active population to be part of the oversight system.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicators that will measure the progress of the 2020 strategy cannot be forgotten either. The feasibility study on issuing joint Eurobonds could constitute an opportunity to examine in greater detail financial instruments for defending against speculation, and to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like it if this could be more than just a study. The creation of the European Monetary Fund deserves our support and we see it not as simply a disciplinary instrument but, above all, as a means of reducing the speculative manipulation of the sovereign debt markets.

I only have one minute to tell you that I believe that in the last few months, Europe has made extraordinary progress in terms of economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Curiously, the summit between France and Germany the day before yesterday also opened the door to a new hope: the possibility of revising our frameworks and treaties on economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is an issue that scared the Member States a little. However, I believe that as pro-Europeans, we know that in order to achieve the economic governance that we need to build, there will probably need to be reforms, which will have to be agreed reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely believe, however, that this agreement between France and Germany opens up the opportunity for the Feio report, which we will adopt later – as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs – to consider the need to adapt our constitutional framework to governance that is not only a stability pact. This is in-depth governance, in order to bring together the economies in a way that seeks to be competitive, create jobs and produce the redistribution to which we, as social democrats, have always aspired.</p>

<p class="contents">For the European Union, these adaptations consist of putting our respective national and EU public finances in order and protecting our currency, the euro, by consolidating it internally and defending its value against the other major currencies. The European Council will be dominated by discussions on Europe’s economic and financial governance. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the initial lines that the Van Rompuy task force has taken, including the plans for a system of sanctions against Member States that do not adhere to the criteria of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still more work to be done, with more Community method and less intergovernmental method. I welcome the work that the Commission has done along these lines. I would ask the Council to remember that this Parliament is now colegislator and will play a full role in defining the forthcoming reforms. The more Parliament is brought on board in the early stages, the more chance we have of achieving a satisfactory and timely outcome. I call on President Van Rompuy to heed this message.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must make its voice heard in the debate on relative currency values, and the European Council must establish our position on the subject next week, before the Seoul G20 summit. Europe must join with its partners, in particular, the United States, in reminding the emerging countries of their responsibilities. Currency dumping and the social consequences it entails must no longer be allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Three major subjects will be on the table at the Seoul Summit: reform of the international monetary system of course, but also the stability of commodities – especially food and energy – and global governance. Europe has a message to deliver on each of these subjects, but this message will only be credible if we put in place effective internal, Community-wide instruments to govern and manage our public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we will not be able to influence global governance and will not really have a place on the international stage unless we can make the often unpopular effort to clean up our finances and unless we stick to our priorities of combating climate change and development policy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I would like to quote a passage from the statement made by the Heads of State or Government at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh held on 24-25 September 2009 – in other words, a year ago. The Heads of Government committed themselves at that summit to the following: ‘To launch a framework that lays out the policies and the way we act together to generate strong, sustainable and balanced global growth. We need a durable recovery that creates the good jobs our people need’. Great! I presume that a similar passage will be written again this year at the next summit, and also at all the other summits. This leads me to ask what has been done in the meantime to bring about the strong, sustainable and balanced growth that will bring the jobs our people need. The description is correct, but what is being created is a philosophy at European level – in the European Council – that says that unilateral cuts in public services through budget reductions are a cure-all for stabilising our continent, rather than giving consideration to the fact that investment that stimulates growth is a basic prerequisite for creating more jobs and, through greater economic growth, bolstering state revenues – as is so urgently needed to consolidate state budgets and enable states to perform their duties. What we are seeing in Europe is that as a result of a more or less black-and-white Manichaean process under which all expenditure is bad and all cuts are good, we find ourselves in a situation in which the countries worst affected by the crisis – Ireland and Greece – are in recession or have zero growth. What is actually being done in practice is achieving the opposite of what was described here as the objective. That is a dramatic development. It is all the more dramatic when those who were at the source of the crisis, who caused the crisis – the financial sector, those who speculated with wild abandon – have not been held accountable by being made to contribute to state revenues through measures such as a financial transaction tax. This may have been advocated at European level, but even at the time it was being advocated, it was already being put on ice on the grounds that ‘We’ll never get it though the G20’. Of course we will not get it through the G20 if we do not even try it first at European level!</p>
<p class="contents">This is an injustice that is particularly dramatic because the lack of action on the part of the Heads of State or Government – the fact that they are leading us in the wrong direction of social imbalance – is continually being reinforced. The people in revolt on the streets are right in that social imbalance in Europe is not being fought against, but rather is being intensified further by incorrect policies. It is the job of this Parliament to make this apparent and to develop strategies to counter it. That is why we insist on the financial transaction tax. The report by Mrs Berès and the report by my colleague, Mrs Podimata, will show us whether this House is prepared to say: ‘We know that it will not be easy, but we insist that the European Union makes a start at levying taxes transnationally on the financial sector if it cannot be taxed at national level’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further worrying development. What happened in Deauville between Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel turns the institutional structure of the European Union on its head. I ask myself when Mr Van Rompuy will draw the appropriate conclusion. He has been asked to work with his task force on detailing the necessary reforms – that should really have been your job, so it was a bit of a cheek to ask Mr Van Rompuy to do it – but to cap it all, the poor man is working on it in secret and before he can present anything at all, our charming couple in Deauville waltz up and announce: ‘We have already decided everything’. What Nicolas and Angela did – this self-appointed Franco-German management committee – is an assault on the institutions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If I were Mr Van Rompuy, I would tell them where they could stick their job. You cannot keep being a doormat for ever and putting up with such abuse. There is one more thing, however: if our fine couple had glanced across the channel from Deauville, they would have seen the white cliffs of the British coast, where a referendum is required for their amendments to the treaty – at least, if Mr Cameron is to be believed. Does anyone really think that Mr Cameron would accept the amendment without incorporating further brakes into the treaty to slow down European law? That really would open a Pandora’s box. I do hope that our charming couple do not come crashing to the floor.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore repeat: Europe is being led in the wrong direction, both institutionally and in substance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maybe we could ask for a convention now if they want to change the treaty. Normally, what we have to do is to ask for a convention. That is the first thing to do, but things are not that far advanced, I think. What we need now is to make an urgent deal in the European Council on economic governance and on strengthening the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now nearly a year since the start of the Greek debt crisis. It started in December 2009, and it is now time to arrive at a conclusion, an agreement, on this. There are, in fact, three proposals on the table at the moment. Let us be clear about that. We have received the proposal from the Commission, the proposal from the task force and, yesterday, the proposal under what we call ‘the deal of Deauville’. That is the third one on the table. And it is good, I think, that this Parliament is analysing the differences between the three proposals to decide if they are appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made what were, I think, good, bold and coherent proposals a few weeks ago. The task force proposal differs from them in that it proposes that the Council should act on the basis of recommendations and not proposals from the Commission. That is a big difference, because recommendations can be changed and proposals from the Commission cannot. In addition, there is a more lengthy procedure for analysis in the task force proposal, which also sets it apart from the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to say that the task force proposal keeps the semi-automatic character of the sanctions and maintains the reverse majority rule that was proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As of yesterday, we have a third proposal, ‘the deal of Deauville’. I have to say that an agreement between France and Germany can often be helpful for Council business, but that this time, on the contrary, it is not. This is because the Franco-German Deauville proposal simply relies on keeping the old-school QMV within the Council, so rather than needing to find a majority to block the automatic Commission sanctions, their proposals require such a majority for the sanctions proposed by the Commission to be initiated. I think that is an enormous difference, because the semi-automatic character of sanctions in the Commission proposal is not present in the Deauville proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if you know Deauville, but, aside from the beach and some beautiful hotels, there is a casino. We should, therefore, perhaps be speaking not of the Deauville deal but rather of the Franco-German casino compromise, because a casino compromise is what it is. Under this proposal, Member States are allowed to go on playing with the euro and the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">If you have enough support in the Council, you can go for it; you can do exactly what Greece did. If you have enough support in the Council, go for it. <span class="italic">Faites vos jeux</span>! You can go for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The first part of the Deauville deal simply weakens not just the task force proposal but, above all, the Commission package. I find this completely incomprehensible, certainly from Germany. For ten months, they have been asking for bolder sanctions, and yesterday, they did just the opposite. It amounts to a weakening of the bold proposals of the Commission. And this comes at precisely the time when Mr Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, is asking for bolder solutions, for bolder proposals, even bolder than the initial proposals by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is that this Parliament has one mission: to reverse the Deauville deal, or the casino compromise. Let us stick to the good proposals from the Commission and carry out our necessary legislative task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what he had to say is important, as was Mr Schulz’s speech. I have my own thoughts for you also.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you all know the film ‘Jules et Jim’? Well, there is a woman – Mrs Merkel. We know who Jules is – it is Mr Sarkozy. The trouble is who is Jim? Is it Mr Cameron or Mr Barroso? That is the dilemma for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament and the Commission need to speak to each other frankly now, because the Council’s policy – Mr Verhofstadt is right on this point – and that of its Franco-German board of directors is anti-European Union. Their policy does not reflect the essence of the EU, and our role today is to go beyond the differences that pit us against each other – Mr Daul is right on this point – and to save the European Union and the Community method. To do this, the Commission, this Parliament and all of us need to understand that there will be no winners in this game unless we find a common approach between the Commission and Parliament, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I believe you when you say that you want a tax on financial transactions or on financial activities. This is not the problem; the problem is, how do we actually do this? It is not enough to say ‘I want’. My four-year-old son says ‘I want’. The issue is to work out how we can achieve our goal, and I think the Commission should not be asking for yet another study, as the Environment Council did yesterday to find out if climate degradation is really so bad that we should be stepping up Europe’s CO<span class="sub">2</span> reduction – even though it is utterly ridiculous to ask for a new study. No. What would a major study on financial transactions bring to Europe, and what would a tax on those transactions bring? A 0.01% tax on financial transactions would be worth EUR 80 billion. If you set aside EUR 30 billion for a reduction in national contributions and hence a reduction in national budgets, you get an extra 50 billion for the EU budget. EUR 120 billion minus 30 billion makes 90 billion, plus 50 makes 140 billion. So, it is possible to implement the European policies we need to implement post-Lisbon, and the Member States and Europe will be the winners. However, this presupposes that we have a European vision.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Barroso, about the deficits: in my opinion, there are deficits and then there are deficits. It is like cholesterol: there is a positive marker and a negative marker. A deficit which invests, and therefore provides a country, or Europe, with prospects, is not a negative thing. If we invest, as we have done before, in the industries of the past which are unproductive – I am talking about coal – we are investing in something that throws money away because it is futile, and therefore we lose out. However, if we invest in the energies of the future and the production of the future, we gain.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what we need to do, and I am asking this of the liberals also, is not simply to talk about ‘stability, stability’, but also to differentiate between what we should be doing and what we should no longer be doing; not simply to talk about a ‘deficit’, but to say, ‘this is productive’, or ‘this is not productive’. If we agree, though this will be difficult, if we manage to come to an agreement, we will be in a position to oppose the Council’s constant manipulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem today is that many governments want to reduce the European policy aspect, whereas our role is to defend and to increase the European policy aspect, because without it, we will not be able to get ourselves out of this.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Mr Barroso, we have a common interest, but we need to take it to its conclusion. It is not Parliament that you should be putting pressure on, but the European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For 18 years of my life, I lived in a country of real socialism, where Party congress after Party congress kept setting new economic targets and the citizens of my country – and the same goes for other countries of real socialism – were told by party congresses that things would get better, and how they should get better. What is more, there was a ministry of domestic trade in my country at that time, even though there was no domestic trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to some of the speeches today, my impression is that the proposal we heard from the European Commission is one which aims to reinstate the priority of economic over political thinking. Over that political mindset which would stifle any sound economic action, because today, politicians at national level and – as we hear – for populist considerations, really like to point their finger at Europe. They say that we need to cut down on Europe and that Europe is not the solution, as this, to some extent, gets them off the hook in the eyes of their voters. If we do not implement something which will make countries realise that they there will be harsh consequences if they conduct economically irrational policies, we will not get anywhere. What is also needed here is solidarity, however. In the Franco-German proposal, I see the real danger of ending up in a situation where the stronger countries will have greater leeway, and where Greece will be unable to go beyond certain limits. Greece will have to cut expenditure, but when it comes to the stronger countries, their luck will be in, and suddenly we will find that they will be allowed to break these rules on political grounds. What I want to say is this: we need European solidarity, and that is why we need European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say that I know that you stand guard over this European solidarity. The latest decision of the European Commission on the gas agreement between Poland and Russia – for which I would like to thank you – is a fine example of how the Community aspect is something that works, and which works in the interests of countries like Poland. I would like to say once again, Mr President, that we cannot wave away reality with a magic wand. If we reach a point where the political solutions, compounded with the dose of populism that exists in some parts of Europe today, dominate over economic thinking, then your ambitious plans to intensify the market – which I consider a very good plan <span class="italic">(sentence unfinished)</span>. I believe that as MEPs, we are well aware of how far we still are from a common market, just from the mobile phone roaming bills we get every month. If we have a common European market but we still have to pay roaming bills, it shows quite clearly that we still have a long way to go before we achieve our aim of economic integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To resolve the crisis, you are recommending austerity with the Stability Pact and now, the reinforcement of sanctions. I think we should be doing the opposite: improving working wages, a new fiscal approach to help support these and a tax on financial transactions, improving social welfare, protecting public services and a bold employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, I fear your strategy could land the European Union in deep trouble. Have you not heard the strength of the peoples’ protests throughout the European Union? For the sixth day yesterday, millions of people marched throughout France, with the backing of 70% of the population. Can you not see the danger that is threatening us today? The European idea, because it is based on competition and a policy of completely free trade, is colliding head-on with money in these economic wars, and now these currency wars. Why do we not look at a new system: a human and social development fund instead of the Stability Pact, in conjunction with the European Central Bank, which should be able to refinance the Member States’ debts and the national banks through money creation, at interest rates that would be favourable to social criteria?</p>
<p class="contents">The way I see it, the European Union must take the initiative in creating a new global monetary order, starting with taking up China’s proposal for a common international trade currency. Like Thailand and Brazil, why does Europe not start by introducing a tax on foreign currency, to ease currency tensions?</p>

You now do everything you can on the world stage and within the EU to acquire all the attributes of statehood.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere could that be more apparent than in your recent proposal for a direct tax to be levied by the European institutions on the peoples of this continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in previous times, there was a very successful independence movement that campaigned on the slogan of ‘no taxation without representation’ and you certainly are not a representative. We have not voted for you and we cannot remove you, so I think with this direct tax, you have actually made a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">And what an expensive club it is becoming. Just two years ago, Britain’s net contribution was GBP 3 billion a year. This year, it is GBP 6 billion. Next year, it will be GBP 8 billion. The year after that, it is due to be GBP 10 billion and now, we hear that you want to take away the British rebate. You want to get rid of the British rebate, which will mean by 2013, our contribution will be GBP 13 billion. It will have quadrupled in the space of six years.</p>
<p class="contents">The taxpayers of Britain, realising all of this, seeing your direct tax, will simply conclude that we cannot afford the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do see a ray of hope: the Deauville deal between Merkel and Sarkozy, the thing that you are all so terrified of today. I hope it happens. Let us have a new treaty. You yourself seem to be almost supporting it. Let us have a new European treaty and let us put it to a referendum in lots of countries, particularly in Britain, and the British people will conclude that this is a very bad deal for Britain. They will vote for us to leave the European Union and begin the unravelling.</p>

Instead, we are now seeing a continuation of such inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to overcome the mistakes of the past. We want a European answer to the nationalism and the vetoes that have been built into most European regulations. We did this in the case of supervision of the financial markets. We are doing so with the report in response to the crisis. We are doing so with the Feio report and we are doing so with our daily legislative work. Let us concentrate on that and not allow ourselves to be sidetracked further, including in this debate. We need to move forward. We need to find the answers. The report by the five groups sends a clear message. We have not yet overcome the crisis. Fiscal and monetary policies are no substitute for structural reforms. We are clearly stating that we want deficits to be reduced as a prerequisite for securing the future. You cannot reduce deficits by simply taking a pair of shears to them. It has to come about as a result of reforms, investments, savings and changes. This report sends a clear response that we want to have more Europe as part of the solution. Let us break through to the next step in integration – the creation of an economic union, the creation of a social union, the creation of a defence and security union, and let us make the internal market the home market of all our citizens.

It contains proposals for crisis resolution and budgetary discipline: in other words, only part of the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that these are only proposals. I am sure the ECOFIN Ministers who dominated the proceedings of that task force would like it to be the end point, but it is not. It is the beginning. We are right at the very beginning of the legislative process. I hope all of the institutions will realise that the work of the European Parliament on the Commission’s legislative proposals will now need to be conducted in a fully democratic process with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The task force said that its aim was to achieve a quantum leap in terms of more effective economic governance. I think what it is proposing is actually more like a potential step back in terms of prosperity and well-being for Europe. It is proposing a strengthening of instruments, but only instruments that focus upon fiscal discipline. That is a problem. Economic coordination is more than fiscal discipline and economic union will not be achieved as long as that balance is not properly recognised. It will inevitably lead to distorted economic policies which take insufficient account of other worthwhile policy objectives for the conduct of macro-economic policy, and by that I mean growth, investment and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso, we do not need another task force to come up with a balanced set of policy measures. We need the Commission to use its right of initiative to bring forward the proposals that will address growth, investment and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposals now on the table, I believe that Parliament has an enormous responsibility in the coming months. We need to make some changes along the lines of the Feio report to be voted on today. I think we need three main changes there: the excessive balances procedure has to be broad enough to cover labour markets, including unemployment levels, and therefore the Employment Council needs to be included wherever relevant; the qualitative assessment of public debt levels and developments in the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact should pay full attention to levels and developments in public investment as well; and the linkage with 2020 throughout the new system needs to be explicit and operationalised as fully as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">On governance, I would mention only two points at this early stage. The Council needs to guide the system and assume ultimate political responsibility throughout, as well as ensuring the due involvement of all relevant Council formations – not just ECOFIN – wherever that is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Parliament needs to be fully involved throughout the process in order to ensure the highest level of democratic legitimacy. Just look at the proposal for the European Semester to see to what extent the role of the Parliament is missing in all of this. Some of us across the political groups are working on strengthened proposals for parliamentary involvement. I hope they will be accepted by the other institutions to give this process the democratic legitimacy it needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the last few days have been a disappointment. When the EU needs clear and stringent budget rules, France and Germany hesitate. This causes us concern. Our message is: leave Mr Rehn’s proposal alone!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank unreservedly Mrs Berès and my colleagues in the Special Committee on Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, who have shown that we in the European Parliament can reach across the party boundaries and find common solutions in the interests of Europe. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has proposed an amendment to the effect that if a financial transaction tax is introduced, it must, of necessity, be done on a global scale. It is important in this case that it is done at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Nationalism must not be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe again. It is a market economy with clear boundaries and free trade that creates prosperity. We need a more unified Europe, a more open Europe, a stronger Europe – we quite simply need more Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed penalty options will initially apply only to the countries of the euro area. In this regard, we would like to see a wording that includes all 27 Member States. I would therefore like to present an oral amendment to the Feio report which I hope that Parliament will be able to support. The rapporteur and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have stated that they are willing to do so. I will read the text in English: </p>
<p class="contents">As far as possible, all 27 Member States should apply to the maximum all the economic governance proposals, recognising that for Member States outside the euro area, this would be done on a voluntary basis. </p>

I can tell you that together with four pro-European groups in Parliament at least, we have made a genuine effort to work on compromises that will achieve something. We have just come from the discussions to try to tie up the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are talking about the budget, some are talking about tax measures, and some are talking about governance. What we need today is for the Commission – and it is your role to do this, we are trying to do it and it is your role to do it also – to propose an overall package: something in the spirit of the Monti report that is also along the lines of what Michel Barnier has been trying to do in the context of the internal market. I am waiting for an overall package from Mr Barroso, which should show us how to get ourselves out of the economic crisis. It should not just be about macro-economic governance, but should be along the lines of reading three or four dossiers on macro-economics, tax and the budget and then saying ‘here is the package’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that if you do that, you will have a very large majority in the European Parliament to support the initiative. If we only look at the issue of public finance, for example, two or three years ago, the Commission and its departments were themselves saying that, of all the countries, Spain was sticking to the Stability and Growth Pact most closely and that Spain’s public finances were in order. The problem is that the instability came from elsewhere and now Spain is in a terrible situation, as is Ireland. We can clearly see that focusing on public finances alone will not help us resolve the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromises that we have proposed in the various reports that have been presented today, which will be voted on tomorrow, represent the sum of these issues. They are a way of saying that, yes, we do need to strengthen budgetary discipline. Of course we do. However, to ensure that this budgetary discipline does not lead to social breakdown, but only to public expenditure cuts, we need, at the same time, a European budget package that will finance investment and a tax package that will allow Member States to impose certain taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">My last question for Mr Rehn, and for Mr Barroso especially, is therefore: are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis? Do you genuinely support it? It has been shelved by the Commission for 10 years now and for 10 years, you have failed to deal with the matter. It is now time that you did so.</p>

<p class="contents">First, I should like to thank the rapporteur, my fellow shadow rapporteurs and the chair of the committee, Mr Klintz, for the compromise that we at last managed to arrive at. I shall only speak in relation to two items in the report, with which I am not satisfied, and they concern neither Germany nor France. Firstly, as the result of aggressive cross-border investment, since 2004, private household debt and business debt in many new Member States has grown, even by as much as 10 fold. Moreover, the absolute majority of these loans were taken out on terms that left all the exchange-rate risk with the borrower. This, in turn, means that the governments of these countries have little room for manoeuvre in their macro-economic policy apart from cutting public spending and raising taxes. At the same time, the primary concern of households is solely to make loan repayments in euro terms. Unfortunately, there is scant reference to this in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, which is linked to the first, is this. Let us picture such a new Member State, whose GDP has fallen back to a pre-accession level, to a pre-2004 level, only with a private debt 10 times as large and public debt five times as large, and this Member State can deduce from this report that even cohesion policy may be altered, altered in such a way that the main criterion will no longer be <span class="italic">per capita</span> GDP but crisis management in a specific territory, which could have extremely significant political consequences.

These declarations also demonstrate impatience, arrogance and aggression towards the response of the workers and populations hurt by their neoliberal and anti-society policies – the Stability and Growth Pact and competition policy – in Greece, France, Spain or Portugal, where there is already a general strike planned for 24 November.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for those who run the European Union to acknowledge the failure of these neoliberal policies: increasing unemployment, social inequalities and poverty, and which are causing recession in the countries with weaker economies, where the EU’s impositions could provoke a real social disaster.</p>

<p class="contents">That is why we are protesting here: giving a voice to the many millions of workers threatened with poverty, to the unemployed, to older people with pathetic pensions, to the young and jobless, and children at risk of poverty to whom they want to deny a dignified future.</p>

It really has done a great job and has made good recommendations and proposals. Of course, ideally, there would be a place for all of these in the documents being drafted by the Commission. It is essential that the Commission does not forget the fundamental and most important issues. One of these is the establishing of a regulatory and supervisory system, which leaves no financial market, no financial instrument and no financial institution off the record book. The Commission should target its actions for the creation of new jobs and link them with measures to combat poverty and social exclusion. All efforts in this direction must, above all, be focused on employing young people. Emergency infrastructure decisions on renewable energy sources, green power, energy efficiency in the transport and building sectors, and a European energy network, are necessary to overcome the crisis. It would be good if, exactly one year on from this meeting today, the Commission could come and say: ‘The provisions of the resolution you proposed did not just remain on paper; we adapted these specific proposals by the Special Crisis Committee and they have already had a real impact’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty is growing steadily, and so too are misery, unemployment and homelessness. And they are so surprised at this, as if it were the consequence of regrettable natural disasters or tsunamis. No, this is the result of decisions taken by European politicians. The increasing misery and poverty stem directly from the neoliberal policy which you – excepting those who opposed them – pursued, and this trend will continue. Poverty and misery will continue to rise if you do not opt for a different value system.</p>
<p class="contents">These two reports can be likened to a scenario where a medical panel determines that the therapy used for a patient so far has caused him harm and made his condition worse, and then proceeds to say that the therapy prescribed on the basis of the diagnosis must be continued, that they must continue what they had done before, but with stricter supervision and punishing the patient if he does not comply, if, for instance, he fails to take his medication. What is at stake here is a conscious choice between value systems. So far, the European Union has deliberately chosen a value system where it always pursues the right decision from the perspective of money and profit, the right decision from the point of view of multinational companies and banks, and never from the perspective of people and the community. It has always looked for what is right from the point of view of an unbridled competition that is not restrained by concerns for justice and morality, and never for what is right from the perspective of social justice and solidarity. This needs to be changed, and from now on, good decisions must be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we look at the consequences from a social viewpoint, we swiftly reach the conclusion – one that is driving much of the Commission’s work – that the worst is yet to come. Unemployment is set to increase and the weak signs of recovery noted in some countries are not enough to guarantee the creation of new jobs. We must therefore accept that it will be essential to face up to the most acute social aspect of this crisis, which was born out of the financial system but which has rapidly spread into economic and social realms.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we must arm ourselves with other instruments to defend the people who are hardest hit. We are about to discuss a proposal for a framework directive on a minimum guaranteed income in all European countries, which I consider very important for combating poverty, on the one hand, and for helping those who will be struck by the sting in the tail of this crisis in the coming weeks and months, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way to combat a crisis, however, is through policies of growth. Growth needs resources, targeted investments and a clear agenda of priorities towards which a significant proportion of the available resources should be directed. The Union budget is not enough. For this reason, the Commission clearly stated a need for additional resources to be spent on infrastructural investments and investments earmarked for competition quality and employment. This path leads to the creation of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions. There is no alternative. This is why the solutions we have indicated – and I hope that Parliament will approve their formulation – are important as well as innovative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, two years later, we are still a long way away from a global answer. In many instances, the measures adopted pursue national interests and considerations. The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to ‘business as usual’. Mervyn King of the Bank of England put it succinctly when he said: ‘The need to act in the collective interest has yet to emerge’. In its interim report, the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis makes it clear that Europe is at a critical crossroads. We need to intensify our integration, we need to harmonise our economic and budgetary policies more, we need European infrastructure projects in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunications. We need a functioning internal market and labour market, and we need the resources required in order to achieve the demanding growth targets set out in the EU 2020 strategy. We need innovative sources of financing if we are to be able to exploit the potential of the SME sector. We need more Community method and less intergovernmentalism. A standstill here is a backward move; it will not preserve the <span class="italic">status quo</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The debt crisis in Europe clearly demonstrates that stability and confidence are not achievable without discipline. The proposals made by Commissioner Rehn and by Mr Van Rompuy’s task force are intended to ensure that the Member States act in a disciplined manner. I regret to say that in Luxembourg the other day, the finance ministers cast aside these proposals at the behest of our Franco-German couple – a missed opportunity and a bad day for our citizens, who quite rightly feel betrayed by politics yet again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether it is the behaviour of our banks or the behaviour of Member States’ treasury departments, we need to ensure a common high standard of behaviour with respect to adhering to an agreed set of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Stronger financial and fiscal discipline by both the private and public sectors needs to be enforced. We need to ensure that, in the search for growth opportunities by the EU, the financing tools used by the EU and the individual Member States are of the highest calibre and as transparent as possible. The use of innovative financing needs to be approached with caution, and the moves by the EU to leverage its own budget need to be taken into account, knowing all the risks and the potential for moral hazard.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Financial Stabilisation Fund is a large off-balance sheet vehicle reliant on a credit rating. To leverage the EU budget in the issuance of project bonds by the EIB needs to be subject to intense scrutiny. As we all know, complex financial instruments and leverage bring their own risk.

The savage ‘scratchings out’, by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the European right, of the rapporteur’s initial, honest and honourable attempt to map the causes of the crisis and provide bold proposals, have given rise to a text which is no longer a text of the European Parliament, the only democratic institution in the European Union; it is a Commission text, a text which conceals the cause of the crisis and commits EU policy to the Merkel, Sarkozy and task force initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We made proposals to improve the text. We criticised the Stability Pact and the functioning of the European Central Bank. We tabled amendments in order to see if everyone talking even today about the European Union taking a wrong turn meant the same thing. Our proposal was inspired by today’s demonstrations in France, by the demonstrations by workers in Germany, whose incomes are being cut so that Siemens has money for bribes, by the demonstrations by workers in Greece, who are currently being treated like guinea pigs, a text, in other words, which has ended up in a form which we cannot accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not adequate. We need to strengthen the strategy for growth, so that in this environment, it is sustainable and socially responsible, and we need better governance mechanisms for EU 2020. We need more and better European economic governance for national actions to support this line, including the financial transaction tax that I urge the Commission to look at very carefully, including in a European context. We need a better and stronger united Europe speaking with one voice at global level. We need a better financial regulation and there is a long way still to go.</p>

What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer; once again, it is the lowest common denominator – the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon. I congratulate the Commission. You are still at the table – the Member States are not quite going it alone. I also congratulate the Council. Success has been achieved, France and Germany have an agreement – we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one, but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire.</p>
<p class="contents">What does all this mean? It means that next year, if the growth figures collapse again, we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation. Where is the section, the legal statute, in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis? That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House. Yes, we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform. That is something that we want too. However, we then need to discuss the substance. If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy, then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020. It is already a paper tiger – we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to make a difference. Yes, it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future. Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference? That is what we are waiting for. This debate has yet to take place. That will be the decisive thing for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation. This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes. We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not, and we want to do so before the legislation is passed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to focus my intervention on the creation of a European common treasury for the eurozone countries. This would be a clear improvement of the institutional framework for European economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a very delicate issue for some countries, but we will have to deal with it in the coming years. The European treasury would improve the coordination of the stimulus policies implemented by Member States. The European treasury would also be able to issue eurobonds to finance the construction of European infrastructures. The EU needs its own resources in the context of future diminishing budgets in the EU Member States. A European common treasury collecting some taxes at European level would allow the reduction of national transfers to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Without real autonomy in income, there will not be real autonomy in expenditure. The creation of a European common treasury is a political decision. The sticking point in this discussion is the lack of political will or, to be more precise, the lack of political will on the part of Germany. In the 1990s, Germany had the political vision to push for the launching of the euro, despite the difficulties faced with its reunification process. In my opinion, Germany should lead now and move towards a common European treasury. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one side, are those who advocate a strong Community approach. On the other side, it is fair to say, are a minority in this Parliament who think that the European Union should henceforth work more on an intergovernmental principle. The proposal to introduce various forms of European taxes also fits with this, even though it is called innovative financing. This echoes calls for the strengthening of the European Union, transferring more powers to the European Commission at the expense of the Member States. It is a shame that no one has yet said that the European Union and the European Commission should start reducing their programmes, reducing the number of its often controversial agencies and reforming the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has just been mentioned by the honourable Member from Spain, the problem of Germany’s orientation towards exports has not been addressed at all. Yet this is clearly a central problem, both in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole. German competition policy is being conducted to the detriment of internal demand in Germany. This is not being discussed at all. Above all, however, it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages. It is a wage battle – a wage competition. This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries, on European trade unions and on European workers. Neither the Commission nor the Feio report have addressed this problem.

Growth and employment need their own initiatives. Initiatives are needed to combat the growing internal divergences in the European Union. Specific proposals are needed on the European Monetary Fund.

<p class="contents">Economics, however, is not an exact science and it is not just about numbers. Soviet history reminds us that central counting of tractor production does not, in itself, bring a strong economy, and centralised taxes or a centralised treasury are not a Utopian solution either.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many questions about what actions to take now. Threatening to fine a nearly bankrupt nation feels like an empty threat, and promises of continual eurozone bailouts will always bring moral hazard. I am aware that people are concerned about Franco-German deals, but perhaps they have a point. If the market lends the money, then maybe the market should take the loss, not the taxpayer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to understand the past and the causes of the crisis, and I think the Union has done its homework on that, but today, the focus must be on the future. The global and European economic governance we build is for tomorrow, so it is not just a question of addressing this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe does not exist in a vacuum. When fixing Europe, we are doing so against the backdrop of a world which is very different today from 2008. The G20 was united in favour of the fiscal rescue two years ago, but its unanimity was driven by fear. Today it is divided. The common global good does not exist. There are many forces at work in leading the global recovery and rebalancing the world economy. A major role is played by fundamental structural change, which strongly influences European competitiveness. However, the role of currencies and exchange rates as global adjustment mechanisms has skyrocketed. A new global monetary system is emerging at an unprecedented speed, and the number of players is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid the disaster of asymmetrical adjustments, we urgently need dialogue and collective action. If we achieve this, the question is whether Europe will be able to play its role in this collective action. What is clearly lacking for this is a bold, streamlining reform of the external representation of the euro area. By delaying this reform, we are foregoing potential influence. In the current global circumstances, Europe cannot afford to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Earlier on, the President-in-Office of the Council stressed that globalisation means we have to act at European level and at international level. However, if we look at what is going on in the European Union and internationally, it is quite clear that it is precisely this concrete action that is lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Summit after summit, the great and the less great who are supposed to be governing us parade their inflated egos and wallow in their own pompous words, whilst the main conclusion of each summit is that it will meet again.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this so-called global governance that the G20 is supposed to embody has absolutely no basis in international law and operates outside the United Nations system. The G20 is self-proclaimed; it operates without written rules and is a club of rich nations which have surrounded themselves with a few so-called emerging countries, including such exemplary democracies as Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, Martin Schulz quoted an extract from one of these hollow declarations by the G20. We could do the same with the statements published after our European summits. Endless promises and empty words, never followed up with action. To crown it all, Europe is subjected to Franco-German mini-summits where this strange couple Merkel and Sarkozy claim to be showing us the way.</p>

As part of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, I made a contribution on the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), stressing their crucial role as a driving force for the European Union’s recovery, and its future growth and welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, there are more than 20 million SMEs in the European Union. Therefore, if each of those could create one job, that would mean an equivalent reduction in unemployment. This report sets out recommendations as economic strategies for emerging from the crisis: I will now highlight the main ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the need to strengthen the social market economy, avoiding restrictions to competition and ensuring access to credit for SMEs. Then there is the awarding of fiscal incentives and even subsidies to SMEs in order to maintain and create jobs. Next is the creation of a new Small Business Act with a stronger social dimension. Then there is the establishment of a European network of senior consultants to spread their knowledge. Next is innovation as the most powerful engine for economic growth and, therefore, the essentiality of a fundamental link between industry and innovation. Then there is the establishment of new partnerships between industry and the academic world. Finally, there is the creation of an education system that meets the demands of the labour market, but also that of the need to create new qualifications for new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is correct, and that is why it is always worth checking to see if the train is on the right tracks, when speed is not an end in itself. The Berès report conducts such an analysis, and it is excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that Mrs Berès’ Committee is continuing its work, it may also be worth listening to the economic policy dissidents: for example, the Nobel prize winner, Paul Krugman. He claims that finance ministers are witch doctors who are sacrificing jobs at the altar. We should listen to these people if we want to move away from an imaginary economy to a real one, and then we also need indicators of the real economy, which are employment and poverty.</p>

The priority actions of particular importance include those relating to the cohesion policy and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The cohesion policy must be one of the basic pillars of our economic policy. It will support the development of energy efficiency and trans-European networks which, in turn, will help revitalise the European economy and promote its sustainable growth. Small and medium-sized enterprises are, for their part, vitally important to our future development, growth and prosperity. A new definition must be coined for small and medium-sized enterprises which will also provide opportunities both for a more targeted policy supporting entrepreneurship and for proper action to be taken to reduce the administrative burden and red tape.</p>

However, the difference does not extend beyond the borders of the euro area, which might be assumed to be the case from an economic perspective. Unfortunately, the single currency has not resulted in economic alignment so far. In fact, precisely the reverse has happened. There are currently far more differences between the countries in the euro area than there were when the euro was introduced. This is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact indicators are clearly not accurate and do not work. This is why automatically imposing sanctions will not, in itself, yield positive results. This will have even less of an impact on all 27 European Union Member States. Even the opposite might happen, with the economic stereotypes which are ends in themselves creating new problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is clear. Member States’ economies must converge as far as possible so that the same measures can be used to achieve the same results everywhere. This means more EU-wide policy, more instruments for European institutions, a higher budget and greater budgetary independence for the European Union, including through increasing the proportion of its own revenue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, I think the crisis has become one of integration. A perfect example, once again, is the ‘Deauville deal’, which undermines the Community method and is a reflection of the delusions of grandeur still had by some Member States. At the end of the day, however, which of us is still great?</p>
<p class="contents">In 2050, I understand that Europe will still account for 6-7% of the world’s population, and its economic power will be crumbling. Will continuing to compete with each other in this way help us to take up the challenges of international competition, or will it be by allowing ourselves to be governed by the Community method and acting together that we will be able to meet these challenges? Europe will need resources in order to do this: new and innovative resources. The debate on the future financial perspective is a good opportunity to discuss these resources and try to identify them: in terms of research and development, and in terms of the external action service also.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of creating a 28th European diplomatic corps if it is just added to the existing bodies without thinning these out?

The Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis has also completed a great deal of work in the past year. That is apparent from the 1 600 amendments to the original draft report that have been tabled. The Committee has now been extended by a further year. In my view, this is quite correct. The crisis is far from at an end. Ireland has only just escaped bankruptcy, the state budget in Greece is certainly not yet back in good shape and the overall situation gives no reason to sound the all clear. The financial and economic reforms must therefore continue and it is too early yet to bring to a close the debate on the causes of the crisis and the conclusions that must be drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be incorrect to declare the work of the Crisis Committee more or less done and to end its mandate. Instead, we must carry out further work based on what has been achieved to date. That is why I feel that the interim report that has been tabled is acceptable to all. This is also demonstrated by the broad approval it has enjoyed in the Crisis Committee. Certainly, the text could have been worded somewhat more concisely and succinctly at some points, but we should see the report for what it is – an interim answer.</p>
<p class="contents">What is much more important than the wording of individual passages is that in the second half of the Committee’s work, we build on the preliminary work that we have done. We need to consider how and where the discussions of the Crisis Committee can be supported in the forthcoming debates by the legislative committees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as instruments are concerned, I believe that decisive progress has been made and that we are therefore going in the right direction. What I cannot understand is the strategy. In other words: are we all following the same approach? We have always spoken about stability but now, the time has come, in fact, it is overdue, to speak of growth.

No small number of people in my own country, Latvia, have also suffered. A 20% reduction in economic turnover, and an equally steep increase in unemployment. My countrymen and women understood that in these extraordinary circumstances, extraordinary solutions had to be adopted. What have these solutions been? In order to restore our public finances, the people of my country, Latvians, have patiently suffered a reduction in salaries of more than 30%, coupled with tax increases. As a result, stability in our finances has been brought about in Latvia. So why my indignation? I am indignant when I read today that Germany and France, far from wishing to strengthen financial supervision in the European Union, wish, in fact, to weaken it. Would this then mean that my countrymen’s and women’s work would have been in vain? Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow such a situation, in which some large Member States wish to continue to live irresponsibly, to prevail. We must strengthen the Commission’s proposal, so that Europe can have strong financial supervision. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are high levels of growth in other parts of the world, but not in Europe and not in the US. More than anything else, this is rooted in overspending and lack of growth. I think that is one of the most important challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to kick-start growth but, in doing so, we need to have stability in public finances. That is why I find it worrying – adding to what has already been said by previous speakers – that some European leaders are now talking about more lax and flexible rules regarding the Stability Pact, and opting for a change to the treaty. I do not think that what Europe needs is a decade of discussions about treaty changes. That is more of a policy for disintegration than integration and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to strengthen the Stability Pact with as many automatic sanctions as possible. We need to ensure that budget deficits are reduced, in confidence and in good order, at the same time as we are reforming in order to open ourselves up for more economic growth – opening up European borders and opening up for more competition. That is the way ahead and what we should stand up for in the G20. That is also the aim for the European agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position is of huge significance to Greece, and others, because there are forces within the country which are arguing the very opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally would like to support this position in the Berès report, as countries which have a huge deficit and debt and, in particular, countries which no longer have access to the international capital market, must reduce their deficits before recovery can take hold. There is no other way. Without deficit reduction, there can be no access to international markets. Without access to international markets, there can be no recovery.

<p class="contents">Firstly, too great an emphasis is placed on the criterion of public debt within national economies when other indicators are equally important. At the same time, a certain amount of public debt is inevitable in times of crisis, inasmuch as the governments must compensate for deficits in the private sector with economic activity in the public sector, or more precisely, by public stimuli for the private sector which may slow down growth in unemployment. This is because, ladies and gentlemen, in all these numbers, we are forgetting about the people who did not cause the crisis; we are forgetting about unemployment and the worsening social situation. I would also like to emphasise the fact that without Europe-wide coordination on economic policies and finance sector regulation, the way out of the crisis will be very difficult.</p>

I think that the European Union was a little late in responding to the consequences of the crisis. The first reactions of Member States were not in harmony with each other. In future, we will need appropriate economic management mechanisms in order to deal with times of crisis. For the sake of our security, we must ensure that the European Union can rely on its own strength. In my opinion, the work of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis is still necessary, since the crisis is not yet over and the financial markets have not yet stabilised. Member States must harmonise their budgetary policies and share these with each other. The internal market is one of the indispensable levers of growth, and hence the EU 2020 strategy must focus on long-term investments and employment. We need to strengthen the position of SMEs, since their essential work is the driving force behind research, innovation and growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the hard times have highlighted even more the fact that the various national economic recovery plans were poorly coordinated and not effective enough. Furthermore, certain Member States really did not have opportunities to create genuine national economic recovery plans, including measures to stimulate growth and employment, because they reduced public spending even more during the recession and increased taxes in order to reduce national debt. Unfortunately, in some Member States, this is being done at the expense of ordinary people. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the crisis highlighted very clearly the social inequality between different social groups. For instance, women are at much greater risk than men of finding themselves below the poverty line. Thus, the European Union must learn the lesson of this crisis and implement the initiatives it adopted in all fields by coordinating joint action with the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Something that is anathema to us in Europe – namely, devaluation or intervention in the currency markets – is now a problem forced upon us by globalisation. The US wants to reduce public debt, the Japanese want to boost the economy and the Chinese want to increase exports. This soft currency policy conducted by other economic powers naturally harms Europe, as well as other countries, and therefore must, in my opinion, be an important topic of debate at the G20 summit.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, flooding of the world’s markets with cheap Chinese imports is easy if the currency is artificially undervalued. This kind of enduring intervention distorts the market; an extremely dangerous game which, in a worst case scenario, could bring the entire global economy to its knees.</p>

I should like to reply to two or three of those speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">First, to Mr Zīle. I think that what he said is very important when we come to reform cohesion policy. We must make an assessment of this cohesion policy, to establish whether, over the course of the years that have elapsed since accession, the gamble that internal inequalities could be partly evened out by the application of these funds has proved to be correct, and to make an objective assessment so that we can learn lessons for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members – and I thank them – have spoken about the representation of the European Union and about world governance. This is entirely a question of strategy for our European Union, again at a time when currency wars seem on the verge of breaking out. We need to speak with one European voice, both internally and externally. Let us use our internal strength to be strong and united in our representations to the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, to echo what my colleague, Robert Goebbels, said, it is true that the G20 is not the solution we ultimately aspire to for world governance, where everyone has his or her place and where there is room for the arbitration authorities that we need. This harks back to the speech made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations yesterday, to the effect that we must follow our future course within the United Nations, through a root-and-branch reform of that institution and its governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, to round off this debate, I should like to return to the topic of public investment, and come back to what my fellow Member, Mr Lamberts, was saying. In our report, we call for an annual review by the Commission of public and private investment needs and for the introduction of performance indicators that will actually enable us to have a long-term investment strategy for the benefit of jobs, and hence, for the benefit of European citizens. This strategy would be founded on a sustainable vision and the concept of solidarity, which is at the heart of the European Union.</p>

It is time to move from words to actions. From now on, following this vote, which I hope will be in favour, Parliament will have its own position on the subject of economic governance. This position will advocate the spirit of the Union: greater transparency and more publicity. It will advocate economic governance as a goal for the growth of all 27 Member States of the European Union and better coordination between them, with greater economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, it will advocate a Europe of greater solidarity, preparation and effectiveness; a Europe for all, with different voices but singing from the same hymn sheet; a Europe with Council, Commission and Parliament positions. The Europe of economic governance is not the Europe of two-party summits: it is the Europe of institutional voices, of the European Parliament and of the public having a voice.</p>
<p class="contents">What stands out is the crucial role that this House and the national parliaments must have in this area. They must have their own vision on the necessary macro-economic supervision of Member States, they must have their own voice regarding how the Europe 2020 strategy is implemented, and they must pay close attention to the issue of reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact. Parliament has a series of different proposals in relation to the other institutions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, let me start by thanking rapporteurs Berès and Feio and the honourable Members for this very substantial and substantive debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do appreciate that the volume of the contributions corresponds to the importance of the issues discussed. I want to make a few comments, responses and remarks on the debate and reports, and I will begin with the international scene.</p>
<p class="contents">In the world economy, the pre-crisis imbalances are re-emerging, which threatens a sustainable recovery and job creation. It is therefore essential that the G20, first the ministerial meeting this week, and then the summit in two weeks, is able to pursue effective international policy coordination to rebalance global growth.</p>
<p class="contents">All countries must play their part in rebalancing: surplus countries by reinforcing domestic demand, and deficit countries by focusing on export growth. This is a matter of millions of jobs in the world economy and in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is working for a strong and stable international financial system in which exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. This is an essential element of the G20 goal of rebalancing global growth for the sake of sustainable recovery and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reasons, it is essential for the EU to reform and reinforce its own economic governance. The reports prepared by Mrs Berès and Mr Feio are important contributions to this effect, and the Commission’s legislative proposals, once adopted, will make a quantum leap towards a true and effectively functioning economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">There were some questions about the Commission’s views on levies and taxes on financial institutions. I discussed this with President Barroso and we thought it would be useful to clarify our position in this regard because there were some confusing statements made concerning this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in the midst of a fundamental reform of our own financial system and we need to keep up the momentum at the G20 as well. The Commission has put forward a proposal, first of all, on a stability fee or a bank levy so that the private sector, the banking and financial sector, would and will participate towards the costs caused by the crisis and towards the resolution of future crises.</p>
<p class="contents">This is on the table and, in some Member States, this is being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission wants the financial sector to play a part in covering the costs of the crisis and that is why the EU – and the Commission – are committed to pushing for a financial transaction tax at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission has, in the meantime, tabled as one option for own resources in the EU budget a proposal that the financial sector should make an equitable contribution at EU level, such as a financial activities tax.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our view. We have proposed a bank levy or stability fee; we have raised the possibility of a financial activities tax as a source for own resources; and thirdly, we are committed to pushing for a financial transaction tax at the global level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report by Mr Feio, there is a proposal on establishing a European monetary fund. The Commission is in favour of establishing a permanent mechanism for crisis prevention and crisis resolution which must have two sides, two elements, two dimensions. There needs to be an accent on crisis prevention as well as on crisis resolution, because it is better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards crisis resolution, we have clearly stated already in May that a robust framework for crisis management for the euro area is necessary, and the Commission intends to make proposals for a permanent crisis resolution mechanism in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">A few general principles have emerged, especially that crisis prevention and resolution must go hand in hand and that any financial assistance must be subject to strict conditionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a permanent mechanism must minimise moral hazard and provide incentives for the Member States to pursue a responsible fiscal policy and incentives for investors to pursue responsible lending practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmidt proposed an amendment concerning voluntary participation of non-euro area Member States in the sanctions regime. You know that at the first stage, we are proposing a regime for the euro area Member States and, at the second stage, for all 27 Member States. The Commission can accept and endorse this amendment, which aims at involving the non-euro area Member States in the sanctions regime on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made satisfactory progress in the context of the task force and achieved convergence towards the Commission’s initiatives to reinforce economic governance, notably focusing on prevention and pre-emptive action, putting an emphasis on debt sustainability, agreeing a method to address macro-economic imbalances and establish an effective enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there has been a convergence of views towards the Commission’s proposals in the task force, the normal legislative process is only just starting. So far, we have only seen the beginning. We are perhaps at the end of the beginning, but now the real normal legislative process is just starting, and the European Parliament, as the colegislator, has indeed the crucial and decisive role.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to work together with you, and we call on the Council and Parliament to deliver the legislative decisions by the summer of next year so that we can have the new system of economic governance in force by next summer, 2011, when we have the next major round of assessment of effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">This is really a matter of credibility for the European Union in terms of reinforcing economic governance, and I fully agree with you that it is indeed the Community method that makes the European Union work and deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to you very carefully on this. I appreciate your firm commitment to the Community method, starting with the speeches by Mr Daul, Mr Schulz, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Cohn-Bendit, although I cannot stretch to such oratory elegance as the ‘Deauville deal’ or the ‘casino compromise’.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyway, let us demonstrate together once again that the Community method can deliver, and now it must deliver, the new system of economic governance, and let us thus complement the strong monetary union by a strong and effective economic union to make a real and complete economic and monetary union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After the limits of a system of self-regulation were highlighted to a worrying degree by the recent financial crisis, it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to choose a global control system. The current phase of economic and financial instability, the most severe for decades, has led to an employment and social crisis on such a scale that decisive action is required to eliminate its negative repercussions and prioritise the opportunities that open up in a globalised economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in recent years has sorely tried most of the advanced economies. Recovery is still slow for some countries even today, and the ongoing fragility of financial markets makes global coordination and the choice of appropriate economic and industrial strategies key aspects in combating the financial crisis. Global supervision should, in fact, promote the stabilisation of solid financial markets and sustain the current recovery, guaranteeing strong growth in demand and employment levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation requires an improvement in the economic framework and the development of ambitious monitoring instruments which are more clearly defined and better targeted. It is vital for Member States to abide by the regulations and decisions stipulated at European level, especially those relating to the Stability and Growth Pact. With this in mind, I wish to welcome the initiative tabled by Mr Feio, intended to encourage such actions as devising more controls and monitoring more closely trends in public debt and revenue.</p>

This framework allows for the development of an ambition grounded in a long-term vision.

Parliament has now made it clear that we in Europe must persist with this action, even though the rest of the world may, for the time being, be holding back because they have got cold feet. The next step is the European Commission carrying out a feasibility study. What we have decided on today is a specific intervention and an answer to the financial crisis. It also sends out a clear signal to European citizens that we have learned from all the things that have gone wrong over the past few years and that we are tackling the crisis in order to make Europe stronger, in the interests of European citizens, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to the lack of any global consistency in these regulatory structures, countries responded off their own bat. They failed to take into account that, in a globalised world, monetary policies adopted nationally have a significant impact on other economies. The creation of the European Systemic Risk Board and European Financial Supervisory Authorities strengthens financial supervision within the EU. However, there are still insufficient regulations available at international level for managing crises in the finance sector. The EU must stress at the G20 meeting in November the importance of having a supervisory and regulatory system whose actions will include making it compulsory to register financial transactions and instruments. We have a responsibility to the economy and we must first of all be strong at European Union level to enable us to lead the way globally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a systemic crisis resulting from capitalism in its current phase of development – neoliberalism. In view of this, the crisis in the EU comes from the very foundations of the EU itself, which has neoliberalism as one of its main tenets. Faced with the disastrous results of its policies, the powers that have essentially determined the direction of the EU are showing signs of a worrying arrogance and aggressiveness, seeking to impose unacceptable setbacks on progress, particularly for workers and people from the most vulnerable countries, through an intolerable attack on their sovereignty. This is the meaning of the joint declaration that Germany and France decided to make in Deauville before the meeting of the G20 and the European Council. They seem to be ignoring the fact that forging ahead on the path that brought us here can only lead to disgrace. This is the message that is echoing across Europe in the protests of workers and the public. It is time for them to listen!

The crisis, in itself, may serve as a window of opportunity to implement measures which will stimulate economic growth, competitiveness and social progress in Europe by putting citizens at the heart of the European economy. I support the rapporteur’s commitment to give clear indications for a way out of the crisis: taking concrete measures and initiatives focusing on the importance of the internal market, employment and the role of SMEs. Moreover, a new holistic and inclusive approach has to be adopted whereby citizens’ goals, particularly those related to economic, social, health and environmental concerns of citizens, are fully integrated into the economy.

The European Union must be a strong partner, capable of not only applying its experience in economic and political integration, but of also making a significant contribution to global economic governance. We need to devise credible and viable economic policies in the medium term and coordinate a macro-economic policy which will be based on a framework for sustained, balanced growth, drawn up by the G20. A strategy for the EU’s economic policies must include the following: an action plan on using the structural reforms to reinforce economic growth and employment, consolidated fiscal reform and increasing economic governance of the EU and euro area.

People in various EU states have experienced the fall-out from the crisis in different ways. It is essential to pinpoint the mistakes, malpractice and unprofessional conduct of national governments in order to prevent the situation their people find themselves in from getting worse in the future. Latvia’s government has, for example, already borrowed an amount exceeding twice its annual budget from international financial institutions. With each passing day, the Latvian Government adopts measures relating to the tax system and fiscal policy in general that disadvantage the people and are leading to business liquidations and the emigration of Latvian entrepreneurs. The Latvian Government is constantly trying to amend the pensions legislation so as to reduce payments to pensioners. This is leading to a social explosion and comprehensive injustice. We have to send a strong signal to national governments that reducing social payments and pensions in a time of crisis is a crime against the population. I am convinced that the unprotected and needy strata of society must not bear the responsibility for the mistakes of governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that we are returning to business as usual rather too quickly as far as the threats facing Europe are concerned. We are not giving proper attention to the warning signals from the financial markets, or from people such as President Trichet, who indeed called the Commission proposal a good but inadequate step towards strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact. Our role today, as the European Parliament, is to defend the European Commission’s proposals against the governments of the Member States which have not, apparently, learned any lessons from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Council had properly adhered to the provisions of the pact, the scale of the European crisis in public finances would have been much smaller. If, today, we allow governments and, in particular, the governments of Germany and France, to water down the Commission’s proposals, the crisis will deepen, and we will have to wonder whether the entire common currency project has any point in its current form, and whether we will inadvertently prove that the euro was a failed experiment. Parliament faces a major task. We must defend the euro, and oppose any short-term political aims. We must force all Member States to conduct responsible budgetary policies, painful though it may be.

It therefore indicates a moment that separates one stage from another. We must look beyond and consider the past in order to implement the structural changes that will make our small and medium-sized enterprises more competitive and able to face up to the greater pressure that will come from a globalised environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, we must also guarantee employment for a good proportion of the more vulnerable part of our workforce and their families. The European Union needs new economic governance that will ensure the stability and rigour of national public finances. A financial and economic crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing must never happen again. Europe’s new economic governance must take into account not only the level of government debt, but also its sustainability in the medium to long term. Private debt and the sustainability of social security systems are just as important as government debt as such for the stability of public finances. Indeed, countries that controlled government debt have plunged into a deep crisis precisely because of the serious indebtedness of families and companies, while countries with high government debt have come through well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, some Member States, particularly France and Germany, were too hesitant at introducing stricter regulation. Overcoming the economic crisis is one of the greatest challenges we have faced and one to which there can only be a European answer, not a national answer. This also applies to sanction mechanisms, which are still being blocked by some Member States. Under the new rules of the internal financial market, however, it is high time that the currency union were strengthened and, at the same time, public debt, in particular, reduced in order to secure the future of the European economic area. The national parliaments, in particular, need to be more intensively involved in this process in order to Europeanise the debate in the Member States. Only then can a European answer be found with which to overcome the crisis and achieve a robust, strong economic union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe that, in order to find a sustainable and appropriate response to the financial, economic or social problems of the crisis, we need a broader-based approach and a more balanced perspective on these problems. The Finance Ministers of the Member States are not in a position to evaluate the situation on the labour market and to come up with answers to the pressing labour and social policy issues that give due consideration to the needs of workers or the people in general. I therefore call for regular meetings of the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs in the G20. Moreover, I call on the EU and those Member States that are also members of the G20 to develop this idea further and to cooperate more closely with one another in the field of employment and social policy and to aim for a more balanced approach at summit level. We cannot allow competition to undermine the protection of workers’ rights.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the crisis. What our citizens expect from us politicians, above all, is to overcome the crisis: to fight poverty and social exclusion, and especially so this year. The crisis did not start in Europe, but it is here, in Europe, that it has to be overcome. This House has demanded ambitious reforms from the European Commission and the Council. Above all, however, we have adopted key financial reforms such as the Financial Supervision Package, regulations limiting bankers’ bonuses and concerning requirements for the capital held by the banks. In doing so, we have laid the foundations of the walls which will protect our citizens from future crises.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do more, however: we need to integrate our European markets better, because that is what will guarantee economic growth and lower prices. Professor Monti’s report must become law. It is worth noting that important parts of the report came from your initiatives – the initiatives of Members of the European Parliament and our committees.</p>
<p class="contents">When I represented this House before the European Council, I said that we must be honest with people about the need to tighten our belts in this difficult time, the need to work longer and retire later. That is the only way we will be able to maintain Europe’s prosperity. It is a long-term programme of structural reforms, which cannot be achieved from one day to the next. This will help us to implement the Europe 2020 strategy and to secure competitiveness and jobs, which are the most important things for our citizens. Recovering from the crisis and proceeding to long-term development are our most urgent tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, solidarity. The crisis has shown how important European solidarity is. I have been to the places which have been particularly hard hit – Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and Greece. I gave messages of solidarity, but also stressed that there is no solidarity without responsibility. We have managed to head off the crisis to a large extent. We have saved the patient, but now we have to make sure he can leave hospital on his own two feet. What we need, therefore, as I said earlier, is a long-term strategy for getting out of the crisis. We also need proper economic management. We need structural, social and educational change. At times of crisis, we have to show realism, but also sensitivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, energy policy and climate change. Energy is a major commodity in the economy. Energy and climate protection are some of our main priorities, and key political drivers for other economic initiatives. Energy security, coupled with environmental protection and electricity that is as cheap as possible, has become the main challenge of the 21st century, as we are all well aware. That is why, on 5 May 2010, together with Jacques Delors, we announced the Declaration on the creation of a European Energy Community. We would like that name, ‘European Energy Community’, to become a hallmark of all EU enterprises operating in this field. I repeat: the Commission, Parliament and the Council have already done a lot of work in this area, and work is ongoing on these topical issues, but it is also important to give an additional stimulus and provide these activities with an ‘umbrella’ which will allow them to be put into effect properly. I am pleased that today, I will be signing a new regulation on the security of gas supplies which we have adopted together.</p>
<p class="contents">Much work still needs to be done before the energy market becomes a single common market. I will continue working on this with you. The most important thing is for our activities in the field of energy also to protect the climate. We are leaders in this field, and want to remain the leaders. We, as the European Parliament, have signed an agreement on the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), thereby creating a ‘green parliament’ which will save energy and start using alternative sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: external affairs. As MEPs, we are ambassadors of democracy and contribute to the organisation of free and fair elections as part of our mission. Not a week goes by without one of us promoting our fundamental values alongside our business interests. We are the world’s largest economy and the greatest donor of aid, but we are not making full use of our strengths. We need to revise the way in which we achieve our aims, and we have to incorporate support for democracy and human rights in our trade negotiations. We should not apply double standards, regardless of whether our negotiating partners are large and powerful or small and weak.</p>
<p class="contents">My role as President is to strengthen our common voice and to communicate our citizens’ views beyond the borders of the EU. We have thus strengthened our parliamentary diplomacy. I have represented you at the G8 parliamentary meetings. I have made official visits to China and the USA. Our relations with the US Congress, where we have a representative office, have improved in quality. I was the first President of Parliament to visit Russia in 12 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to our common efforts, we have set up a Secretariat for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean and are successfully cooperating with Latin America through EUROLAT. However, we should admit that we still have a lot of work to do before we get parliamentary cooperation under way in EURONEST, which is part of the Eastern Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have just finished voting on the European External Action Service. Soon – and this I deeply believe – it will become our great strength and create our European potential. We negotiated firmly with the Council to make this a modern Service which represents the Union point of view and the common interests of Europe. However, we must acknowledge that all parties were very open to compromise, and so our congratulations must be mutual. All of us took part in the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us stay with foreign affairs for the time being, and let me go back over what we have done this year: we rejected the SWIFT agreement. This was an exceptionally important moment. The US Government has seen that the post-Lisbon Parliament means business. In future, not only the USA, but the governments of many other countries will find this out. When future historians come to evaluate this vote, they will say that we did the right thing in the interests of our citizens. We struck a balance between security and the protection of personal freedom. This is important because, as MEPs, we represent our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth: human rights. They are a priority for our Parliament, and they are mine, too. I always raise this issue wherever necessary. I know that 735 defenders of human rights stand behind me, and that behind them are 500 million citizens. In Russia, I asked President Medvedev about the murders of human rights activists and journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya and Sergey Magnitsky. When Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Prize, I repeated my appeal for his immediate and unconditional release. Tomorrow, we will decide who will be awarded the Sakharov Prize this year. I am resolved to use the Sakharov Network of Sakharov prize winners, as well as the forum of former presidents of the European Parliament, as an effective tool in our struggle for human dignity, human rights and democracy throughout the world. Human rights activists can be certain that their fate matters to us. They matter to us! The European Parliament is a place where people matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth: Women’s rights. I have repeatedly called for more women to be elected to the highest EU positions. I have had overwhelming support from all Members of this House. I also supported the initiative to introduce quotas on electoral lists. A political system which cannot ensure proper representation for 52% of its population in decision-making bodies loses contact with society. Europe must be united in a coalition for work and, at the same time, family life. It is important, particularly at times of economic crisis, that maternity does not become victim to insecure working practices. We have just held a debate on this issue, and it is also related to overcoming the demographic crisis in Europe. As I confirmed 15 minutes ago, I decisively support any such action in this House, although the Chamber is possibly not the best place for such action.</p>
<p class="contents">Aristotle said that excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue. We must ensure the equal participation of men and women in public life. Let us follow in Aristotle’s footsteps.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventh: institutional reform. Since I was aware of the importance of the Treaty of Lisbon, I was in Ireland, as were many of you, convincing the Irish people to endorse the treaty. I was also with President Klaus in the Czech Republic, calling for its ratification. We worked hard to bring the treaty into force, and we succeeded.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important changes has been to strengthen the legislative power of our Parliament. We now have new rights, but also new responsibilities. The treaty, in strengthening Parliament’s role, still allows us to take many decisions using the intergovernmental method. For this reason, we still need to promote the Community method as an effective tool for citizen scrutiny. Yet let us remember that the decisions on the direction the European Union is to take still depend largely on the Member States, on Heads of Government, presidents and chancellors. The possibility of cooperation with a view to strengthening the European institutions which have given Europe strength in the past is very important, and I am convinced that this will happen in future, too.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the European Parliament, I have put all my energy into strengthening the position of our House with regard to other European institutions on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon. I did this because we represent the citizens and we are directly elected by them, so we also owe them full representation before the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made substantial progress towards increasing the answerability of the Commission to this House. We have also introduced changes in the way Parliament itself operates. For the first time, we will have a monthly question-and-answer session with the President of the European Commission, the first debate on the state of the Union has already taken place, we have regular meetings of the Conference of Committee Chairs and the College of Commissioners, and I also hold meetings with the Commission and the College of Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">We have initiated dialogue with the Council Presidency on legislative planning. I regularly meet the Head of the Government in charge of the rotating Presidency. For the first time, the President of the European Council has not just appeared at a plenary session, but also met with the Conference of Committee Chairs immediately after the European Council. Finally, and I consider this to be extremely important, we are building a close partnership with the national parliaments. I would like to thank, as we all would, the national parliaments for their willing cooperation. We will now be jointly responsible for legislation at European level. It is our common responsibility for the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighth, and this is my final point, the budget – our most important task for the future. It is our duty to make sure that the 2011 budget contributes to economic growth. The budget’s structure determines the list of political priorities. We must take great care that it contains the money promised to our citizens. The ‘cuts’ must not be dictated by empty populism. They must not deprive our citizens in fields such as education, training, scientific research or infrastructure projects. We must always ask questions about the financial repercussions of less expenditure at European level. Will the financial repercussions mean less Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">Our late fellow Member, Egon Klepsch, a former President of this House, when discussing Parliament’s first vote on the budget, said that Parliament was defining the European ‘public interest’, which, he said, was the real test. We now face just such a test, all of us, today.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now proceed to the conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have a lot of urgent legislative work ahead of us. At the end, I would like to speak once again about the most important ones. Our goal is to come out of this crisis and to safeguard our citizens against another one. I repeat: this crisis was not born in Europe, but it has to be eradicated here in Europe. We cannot overcome the crisis using traditional methods. This is why in Europe, debates – very wide debates – and the imagination of its citizens are so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the single market, it is important to strengthen the market of ideas, of our fundamental values. We have to discuss the role of the state and the future of Europe, the transfer of knowledge, alternative systems of social security, new education methods, culture.</p>
<p class="contents">As your representative, I had the privilege of taking part in important events: the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the 60th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Solidarity trade union, and the 20th anniversary of the reunification of Germany. Let us say, from the total nightmare of war to the spirit of solidarity and the reunification of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In my discussions with our partners from outside the European Union, I see that our European model is respected around the world. Let us be proud of our community method of cooperation – for the past sixty years, it has given us peace and now a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we believe in Europe, we have to believe in ourselves. In order to dissuade any doubts about the European Union, we have to go back to its roots. Then we will understand that peace, stability, prosperity and an open society are not given to us once and for all. The dangerous and unthinkable could happen again if we do not contain populism and do not care for our basic values of freedom and solidarity for all.</p>
<p class="contents">In remembering the past, let us arrange the present and let us think of the future. Our political forefathers chose the right path. Now it is up to us to shape how the 21st century will be in Europe and in the whole world. This is a battle which is worth fighting for. With colleagues like you, I am not afraid to take this battle on.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much.</p>

Inevitably, there are some technical adjustments that should be voted in the plenary. As far as the integration of Letter of amendment No 1 for 2011 in Parliament’s reading is concerned, some technical adjustments need to be made in both the new European External Action Service section and that of the Commission, following the proposed transfers of appropriations between sections.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European External Action Service section, these concern notably the budgeting of the 1.85% salary adjustment for the new Service, as is the case for the other institutions. The amounts affected by the letter of amendment in the Commission section will also need to be modified accordingly. This also applies to some Parliament amendments on administrative lines, which need to be aligned with the final amounts presented in the budget lines of Section III.</p>
<p class="contents">For the agencies, the remarks following certain agencies’ budget lines will be technically adjusted to make them consistent with the final figures adopted. In line 02 01 04 04, remarks adopted in Amendment 996 should be added as such to Amendment 1010 on operational line 02 02 01 (as part of the package on pilot projects and preparatory actions). In line 19 05 01, the words ‘other than the United States’ should be deleted from the heading and the remarks, as decided by the Committee on Budgets. In line 19 09 01, an oral amendment adopted in the Committee on Budgets should be inserted in the remarks. The following words should be added: ‘part of this appropriation is intended to support, amongst others, initiatives such as the EU-LAC Foundation decided at the summit of EU-LAC Heads of States and Governments and the Biarritz Forum’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to renumber some budget lines in order to avoid contradictory numbering of some lines created and to follow nomenclature rules. This will affect neither the multiannual financial framework headings nor the budgetary chapter of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Budgets. This concerns Amendments 386, 389, 521, 833, 997, 998, 999, 1016, 1018, 1021, 1022, 1023 and 1024. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You all applauded yourselves and you think you have done a good job but, in fact, while countries across the European Union are having to cut public services and having to cut their public budgets, you wanted to increase yours.</p>
<p class="contents">You have increased your entertainment budget by EUR 2 million, an 85% increase. Is this the real message that you want to send to the people of Europe? You have also passed provisions on maternity pay that are going to have a severe impact on my constituents within the UK. This is going to cost jobs; this is going to affect public services.

This interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission satisfies – as far as is possible in a complex and continually evolving system like the European Union’s – some requests legitimately put forward by Parliament regarding the European Commission. It is therefore a good thing that Parliament’s scrutiny of the Commission is facilitated, as the latter is a technical body that cannot be the political brains of an entire continent and must answer for the substance, reasons and methods of its actions. It is also, without doubt, positive that the chance for yet greater involvement of the Commission in Parliament’s work is being sought, in particular, in plenary sittings, in order that it may respond to the requests of representatives of citizens of the European Union and answer for the position of the Commission on current political, economic, social and international issues in a timely fashion. What is certain is that if the EU wishes to move towards a democratic structure different from that of today, relations between the Commission and Parliament will have to improve and intensify.

The final version of the proposal is, according to the rapporteur, a balanced compromise between the views and positions of both institutional parties, whereas the trickiest negotiations were in the EU’s international relations.

The revised draft framework agreement on the relations between Parliament and the Commission is the fifth agreement of its kind to be signed between the two institutions. In terms of the legislative process and scheduling, it is important to point out the changes relating to the ‘Better Regulation’ approach and the announcement of a revision of the interinstitutional agreement on this issue, along with the new regulations regarding the impact assessments carried out by the Commission. Regarding the interinstitutional dimension of the EU’s international relations, Parliament’s aim is having the right to be informed so that it can give its approval with full knowledge of the facts, and prevent the non-agreement of international agreements when negotiations have already been completed. I would also like to point out the allocation of observer status to MEPs at international conferences, who can now also attend all the relevant meetings.

<p class="contents">It is indeed time for the institutional balance put in place by the Treaty of Lisbon to be rigorously reflected. Among the key elements of this revision, we especially need to welcome the equality of treatment between Parliament and the Council, particularly when exchanging information and accessing meetings. In this respect, I can only be glad about the provisions introduced concerning the negotiation of international agreements. How could Parliament give its approval in full knowledge of the facts if it is not informed throughout the negotiation procedure?</p>
<p class="contents">MEPs are well and truly determined to implement fully the increased powers at their disposal since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force: evidence of this was the rejection in February of the Swift agreement.

Until now, the European Commission has, on many occasions, taken no notice of the resolutions of the European Parliament. This, to my mind, is unacceptable. For example, the resolution of the European Parliament of 11 March 2004, in which the European Parliament recommends that the Republic of Latvia grants non-citizens the right to vote in local elections and simplifies the naturalisation process for elderly people has hitherto not been implemented. I should like to know why the relevant European commissioners have yet to address questions to the Latvian Government. Why is this resolution of the European Parliament being ignored? Perhaps as a result of the signature of the new agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the Commission, this type of inactivity on the part of the Commission will be appropriately judged by the European Parliament, and people who do not do their work properly will, on the next occasion, be excluded from membership of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particularly important are the amendments improving legal procedures and strengthening parliamentary scrutiny. I agree with all the amendments which contribute to improving information exchange and promoting the effectiveness of relations between the European Parliament and European Commission. It is important to ensure that this institutional partnership has as little red tape as possible. The new framework agreement on relations regulates the ‘special partnership’ between Parliament and the European Commission. We must not forget that the most important partnership of all is the partnership between the European Union and its citizens. The European Union must try harder to find common ground with its citizens and prove its importance in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly indicated that this agreement represents a ‘new interinstitutional balance’, i.e. a healthy compromise. However, there are some issues on which the European Union cannot negotiate – fundamental human rights and freedoms. Greater powers mean greater responsibility. It is one thing to talk of common values, but implementing and defending these values is a different matter. Unless this is achieved, the various branches of the European Union institutional system will be unable to fully realise their potential.

For example, the recommendations in the European Parliament resolution of 11 March 2004 on the situation of non-citizens in Latvia have still not been implemented.

In particular, I applaud the fact that the framework agreement clarifies the points relating to the political responsibility of both institutions, the circulation of information, external relations, enlargement and international agreements, the implementation of the budget, the political and legislative programme of the Commission and the European Union’s multiannual programme, the legislative competence of the Commission and the exercise of its specific powers, monitoring the implementation of EU law and the participation of the Commission in the work of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is impossible to support the creation of a future European diplomatic service that will be under the administrative, budgetary and political control of the Commission. France, which can pride itself on having the oldest diplomatic service in the world, will have to yet again hand over diplomatic prerogatives to a European Union whose citizens are totally indifferent to the positions it adopts.</p>
<p class="contents">This diplomatic service, for which the Commission has called so enthusiastically, will be a total departure from national heritages. EEAS officials will be unable to receive instructions from Member States and will have to work for the ‘greater’ good of a European Union that is a reference only for Eurocrats themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The organisation and financing of this service do not include the necessary strict control over staffing and financing by the European Parliament, meaning that the EEAS is worryingly lacking in democracy and transparency. It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary, irrelevant position in EU foreign policy, which my group and I firmly reject.

Of the 1 643 posts that the EEAS will start off with on 1 December, 50 are, believe it or not, director-general posts, and during the initial phases, there will be barely more than 30 members of staff under one director-general. When the final structure is complete there will not even be as many as 80. The aforementioned directors-general will, on average, earn EUR 17 000 per month. Below these directors-general, there is another level containing 224 directors and 235 heads of unit. In addition, we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the EEAS staff.

I hope that the main priorities of European policy will not neglect their external component and that, in the course of their action, the service does not neglect the crucial role of European languages in universal communication, nor the global European languages which are most suitable for establishing direct communication with large parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was one of the MEPs who abstained. My main concern was the lack of ambition of its wording on the principle of geographical balance within the employment policy and staff of the future European External Action Service (EEAS). The report failed to introduce a legally binding commitment to geographical balance in EEAS, thus relying only on political promises made by key EU decision makers on foreign affairs. This is why most new Member States do not feel reassured by the proper application of the principle of geographical balance in the future EEAS. It is regrettable that the rapporteur chose such a minimalist line, while the reluctance of the Council to explicitly accept this binding commitment raises even more concern. I am calling on the Council and the Commission to examine the voting result on this report closely and deliver on their promises of respecting the geographical balance principle while recruiting the future staff of the EEAS.

A new Section X has to be created in the budget and the 2010 budget has to be modified in order to provide 100 additional posts in the EEAS establishment plan and a financial envelope for financing an additional 70 contract staff. The bulk of resources necessary will simply be transferred from the sections of the European Council, Council and Commission. The prevailing feeling in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) is that the HR, Baroness Ashton, has not entirely lived up to the promises she made to the EP on the setting up of the EEAS. AFET considers that the EP should be consulted on staffing priorities within the service (e.g. when it comes to geographical balances) and that the issue of gender balance would be better addressed in the recruitment procedure for the EEAS. From a Green/EFA point of view, the fact that until now, Baroness Ashton has not transferred the Commission staff in DG RELEX dealing with peacebuilding and crisis response to the EEAS is considered a major shortcoming, especially as the HR has given messages of assurance to the EP on this transfer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed annual breakdown provides an amount of EUR 75 million in 2010. It is worth noting that the margin available under heading 4 is only EUR 875 530. The most important part of this financial assistance in 2010 comes from a reallocation within heading 4 of the budget, namely EUR 55.8 million from a total of EUR 75 million, which affects instruments and actions that the EU, and Parliament in particular, deem to be of major interest. In addition, the need for financial assistance linked to accompanying measures for the bananas sector was not provided for in adopting the multiannual financial framework (MFF) in force. However, EU financial assistance to ACP banana-supplying countries affected by the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) liberalisation in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) should not be questioned, and the fiscal effort should not be held up. I therefore agree with the change to the draft amending budget No 3/2010, as proposed by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When the Geneva Agreement was signed, which provides for this liberalisation, the EU committed to channelling EUR 200 million to ACP countries by way of compensation for the impact that this measure would have on their exports to the EU. We criticised this agreement at the time, as it will mainly benefit the US multinationals that dominate the global market in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Several ACP countries, as well as several banana producers in those countries, expressed their concern about the agreement’s consequences, believing that the sum of EUR 200 million will not offset all its effects. Now, the report provides for ‘an overall budget of EUR 190 million, with a potential supplementary EUR 10 million, if margins allow’. Furthermore, there were no proper warnings of the impact on the banana-producing countries and regions of the EU, such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira. For these reasons, we abstained from the vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am bound to point out that Parliament and Council have failed to reach an agreement over this matter. Parliament had, in fact, considered using the flexibility instrument, which has proved excellent for dealing with similar situations, because the funds in question are ready for mobilisation and have a legal foundation. Council, on the other hand, had a different idea, due to the reluctance of Member States to use the flexibility instrument, which led to an increase in their contributions as a consequence For these very reasons, the Committee on Budgets acknowledged the impossibility of reaching an agreement over the 2010 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the first time, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council on these matters. This is the first budget following the Treaty of Lisbon. For this reason, and due to the crisis that Europe is experiencing, it is important that the reconciliation process is successful. It is vital that the EU is given a budget for the implementation of priority areas and the new powers that were bestowed upon it by the treaty. It is important to fight for our convictions and for a budget that is visionary in a time of crisis. Parliament’s proposal reflects this ambition. On the other hand, the values proposed by the Council mirror the austerity of budgets adopted at a national level within the EU. The EU, however, must have the ability to react to policy changes caused by major challenges. The EU has a duty to present an ambitious European budget which can assist economic recovery. Only by strengthening areas such as science and innovation, and by contributing to economic growth and to more and better jobs, can we make Europe a more attractive place to live and work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The expenditure for export refunds is determined by law and will therefore be paid regardless of what amount is specified in the budget. However, if the expenditure is not specified in the EU budget it will have to be paid out by the individual Member States. At a time when the national budgets are being cut back, it would be economically irresponsible to burden the Member States with this significant additional expenditure. The Danish Liberal Party is pleased about the considerable reduction in the EU’s export subsidies in recent years and will continue to work to bring about a change in the underlying legislation so that the phase-out can continue. The Danish Liberal Party also voted against a statement that prevents the payment of a special male bovine premium for bulls used for bullfighting.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why the Danish Liberal Party voted against this proposal is that this premium is only paid in Denmark, Sweden and Slovenia, where, as we know, bullfighting does not happen. Finally, the Danish Liberal Party voted against allocating DKK 300 million to a European dairy fund. Dairy prices have risen over the last year and, against that background, the Commission has concluded that, under the current rules, it will not be possible for money to be paid out from such a fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a notable increase in the European Social Fund (ESF), but it is regrettable that only 1.4% of the funds are earmarked for the implementation of social policy, in which health sees a reduction of EUR 15.77 million in relation to 2010. In the field of regional development, there is an increase of about 3.2%, which is considered essential. Regarding agriculture, it is worth noting the extreme volatility of the dairy sector, highlighting the need for a permanent approach to address this issue, namely, through a fund for the dairy sector.

It provides even more hot money, subsidies and facilities to monopoly groups, in addition to the 5 trillion or so already given to them by national bourgeois governments, in order to bolster their position in the inexorable competition between the imperialists, with a clear view to reviving the capitalist system. Its basic approach is, on the one hand, to give out money to capital and, on the other, to slash any – already paltry – spending on workers, small commercial and handicraft enterprises, poor medium-sized farm holdings and young people, and to provide even more money for imperialist intervention by the EU and for the mechanisms which it uses to repress and persecute the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The first budget approved by the European Parliament, with its allegedly enhanced powers under the Treaty of Lisbon, is worthy of its reactionary nature. It proves once again that the European Parliament is faithfully serving the needs and interests of the monopolies and is deeply hostile to the workers and grassroots needs. The working and grassroots class movement needs to step up its fight, so that the workers do not pay the price for the capitalist crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when it comes to voting, and when the European Parliament has the power to make it happen, these are the very people who want to see this proposal buried.

In addition, the annual budgetary process is becoming a special legislative procedure with the budget approved through a regulation, which is liable to be seen as a special codecision procedure or, to avoid confusion, as a joint decision by Parliament and the Council. The 2011 budget which Parliament is proposing is ambitious, intelligent and respects the commitments which it has taken on in a rigorous and realistic way. We are making a priority of policies concerning young people, education, mobility, training, research, competitiveness and innovation. I would like to emphasise the preparatory action in which I was personally involved: ‘Your First Job Abroad’. This will boost the mobility of young people in the EU and help to combat unemployment. This EU budget continues to amount to about 1% of gross national income. This clearly demonstrates the need to revise the multiannual financial framework, given the tight margins for its headings, and particularly for headings 1A, 3B and 4. It is also clear that a debate urgently needs to take place on the necessity of new resources for the Union budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more unacceptable as the sum agreed in the MFF is already an extremely small amount, which compromises any economic and social cohesion right from the start. Hence, it accentuates the damaging effects of the policies that the EU has been pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, also of the opinion that a substantial reassessment of the budget is absolutely necessary, along with an immediate review of the maximum limits of the current MFF. However, this criticism cannot lead us to accept the intention of ‘lisbonising’ the budget that is mentioned in the report which would keep it subservient to the Treaty of Lisbon’s fundamental pillars: neoliberalism, federalism and militarism. In other words, essentially keeping it subservient to the same policies that caused the profound crisis that the workers and peoples of Europe are currently facing. What is needed – starting with the necessary reinforcement of the Union budget, based on contributions from the Member States in proportion to their gross national income – is a break with these policies and a genuine commitment to cohesion, social progress and environmental conservation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In France, Europe has an enormous direct cost: EUR 8 billion per year, a figure that is increasing all the time. In other words, it accounts for a major part of the social security deficit, for example. The indirect cost is even greater, in terms of unemployment, weak growth, relocations, and so on, linked to European policies. The European budget is not complementary to national budgets; it competes with and raids them. With structural policy cofinancing systems, which are nothing other than a sprinkling of patronage, it is also an incitement to spending. An aggravating circumstance is this: for 15 years, the European Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the management by the Commission of these tens of billions of euro.

Large-scale European research projects are financially coupled to recoveries, the amount of which no one knows in advance.

While national governments implement drastic cuts, in some cases, with a short-term vision, the EU budget can provide stability and long-term planning to help – through funds such as the structural funds and cohesion funds – create jobs, provide job training and boost European economies through the recovery, particularly by providing structural funds to deprived areas hit the hardest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no longer a distinction to be made between mandatory and non-mandatory expenditure, for decisions on which both budgetary authorities are now jointly responsible, with the process being simplified accordingly. The fact that Parliament now has the right of codecision on the entire budget reinforces democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">Some further steps to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged.

I agree with the proposed increase in funding for all programmes related to these priorities, namely, the Lifelong Learning, PESSOA and Erasmus Mundus programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the mobility of youth employment is an essential tool for ensuring the development of a competitive and dynamic labour market in Europe, and that as such, it needs to be strengthened. I therefore welcome the increase in funding for the European Employment Service and strongly support the launch of the preparatory action ‘Your First Job Abroad’, which aims to help young people enter the labour market or gain access to skilled jobs in another Member State, as a first step towards a specific non-academic programme for the mobility of young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A tight budget, which is virtually identical to that proposed by the European Commission and adopted against a background of austerity. However, we all know that Europe cannot do more and better with less money.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I, along with several other Members and also the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, Mr Lewandowski, am entering a plea for the European Union to award itself its own resources. A financial mechanism that would guarantee autonomy and room for manoeuvre with regard to the Member States which, crisis situation or no, have long since abandoned the idea of giving Europe the means for its ambitions. I see at least two reasons for not cutting back on the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The first derives from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the new powers for Europe in the fields of foreign policy, energy, financial supervision, to mention only a few. The second relates to the new 2020 strategy, which is intended to put Europe back on the track to sustainable growth, major projects and innovation. New challenges and powers which will need to be well funded. This leads us back to the one and only solution – direct financing of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The annual squabbling over the budgets between the European institutions leads to chaotic decision making and creates an acrimonious diversion, which could be so easily avoided through an own resources system, such as allocating part of the revenue from an EU financial transaction tax, a tax on aviation fuel or a carbon tax to fund the EU budget.

Today, in order to solve as soon as possible the demographic problems we face due to the low birth rate and ageing society, we must share family commitments. Therefore, it is very important that this directive should lay down the right for men to take at least two weeks paternity leave. A child also has an undisputable right to bond with both parents. This proposal will allow us to create a better balance within families and will improve integration in the labour market. Parliament has shown that it can achieve the objectives laid down in the Europe 2020 strategy of enabling families to balance work and personal life better while striving for economic growth, welfare, competitiveness and gender equality.

Improving the provisions promoting a work-life balance is one of the ways which can be used to respond to this demographic decline. Gender stereotypes obviously persist in society, which pose an obstacle preventing women from accessing jobs, especially high quality jobs. Women are still regarded as being the principal carers of children and other dependants, which means that they are faced on many occasions with the need to choose between motherhood and a professional career.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are frequently seen as ‘high risk’, ‘second class’ or ‘unsuitable’ workers, given the strong likelihood of them getting pregnant and exercising the right to maternity leave. It is therefore fundamentally important that the new forms of leave do not reflect or confirm current stereotypes in society. Parents’ involvement in their children’s lives, from the very first months after they are born, is of paramount importance to the child’s healthy development from a physical, emotional and psychological perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This low birth rate, combined with an ageing population, will pose a real problem for us in the future in terms of paying for pensions and medical care charges in Europe. Families, particularly women, should not be penalised if they want to have children. Pregnant workers and workers who are breastfeeding must not carry out activities which, based on assessments, pose a risk of exposure to certain agents or particularly harmful working conditions that jeopardise the safety or health of these workers. This is why I support the notion of implementing measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. These measures must not put women at a disadvantage in the labour market or be detrimental to the directives on equal treatment for women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case in Portugal, for example, where I see it at close hand. However, like other EU countries, the birth rate is not high enough to ensure that generations are replaced, and this harsh situation is jeopardising the future. I believe that more flexible policies with regard to maternity and paternity leave can help to reverse these trends. It is therefore vital to send families a consistent message of support for motherhood and fatherhood, with concrete measures for the better reconciliation of professional, private and family life. Meeting this challenge is vital in order to achieve the economic and social objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and as a way of trying to reverse demographic ageing on our continent. In Portugal, too, maternity leave is already paid at 100% of earnings for 120 days. I would therefore argue that women’s salaries should be assured during maternity leave in the manner described in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the Italian legal system is more innovative, the increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave at European level represents a strong boost in favour of family assistance to newborn babies. The support for paternity leave is also a step in the same direction even though making this compulsory is not perhaps the best way to pursue the laudable aim of ensuring the greater effective presence of both parents at the most demanding time for the new household and ensuring the father is more aware and involved. Support for and extension of the rights of adopted children allows a reinforcement and, it is to be hoped, also a simplification of the adoption process.

The impact assessment estimate for the UK, if maternity leave is extended to 20 weeks, is almost GBP 2.5 billion per year on average. This would result in the cost of maternity leave in the UK doubling. Evidence shows that women are currently benefiting considerably from the provisions already in force within the UK, 9 out of 10 women taking the 20 weeks maternity leave, as well as 3 in 4 women taking all their paid leave. With such a high uptake, it is clear that more European red tape on top of the current legislation is unnecessary in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proposed requirement for 20 weeks’ full pay would result in social regression. This is due to the fact that women on the highest salaries will receive the highest compensation. I fully support the need for adequate, flexible maternity leave, but I believe it is for the elected UK Government to decide, with an input from parents and their employers, how much our own economy can afford to give and how a maternity package is to be delivered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although we are still in the first reading of the directive’s proposal, it is positive in the area of women’s rights because of the signal that it sends out, particularly to the countries that still do not have 20 weeks of maternity leave on full pay and that are still not applying two weeks of paternity leave, also with full pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this proposal for negotiation with the Council acknowledges the fundamental social value of maternity and paternity, respecting the rights of working women who want to become mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this proposal also represents a victory over the most conservative positions that still exist within the European Parliament, meaning that the struggle to defend women’s rights, maternity and paternity rights, and the rights of children, will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Council will now accept the European Parliament’s position, which increases the Commission’s proposal from 18 to 20 weeks, and aims to amend the directive that is currently in force and which only sets aside 14 weeks for maternity leave. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully appreciate the need to ensure appropriate conditions for mothers who have recently given birth. However, in the long term, extending the minimum period of leave to 20 weeks would be disadvantageous for young women planning to have a family and a professional career. What is more, Member States will currently simply be unable to meet the additional costs from their budgets. Businesses have objected to a minimum 20-week period of maternity leave because it will cause additional costs that cannot be met in the current economic situation. There is therefore a risk that many employers will simply not hire young women. We can already see that it is difficult for young people to find jobs, and extending maternity leave will reduce women’s ability to compete with men in the job market still further. I believe that we must not allow this to happen, and that we must think for the long term. Fixing maternity leave at 20 weeks would mean billions in budgetary costs throughout Europe. Those are costs that neither national governments nor taxpayers can currently afford. Of course, we shall come under criticism from one part of society, but we are here to work and to make decisions that are as good as they can be and that are in the interests of all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are of the opinion that the previously established minimum of 14 weeks is sufficient. Women who find that they are still unable to return to work at the end of their maternity leave can take leave under the provisions of their countries’ Sick Leave Act. This proposal would entail an extension of social security, which is a matter that Member States should be able to decide on themselves, certainly in times such as these, when all the Member States have to economise. There are other, less rigorous ways in which measures allowing a better balance between work and private life could be put in place. The proposal carries the risk that young, talented women might be left with fewer opportunities in the labour market, because employers will not want to run the risk of having to pay many months’ maternity leave to their female employees. Nor does an increase in birth numbers in the EU, which is the desired solution to the problem of an ageing population, have to be regulated at EU level. As far as the VVD is concerned, EU rules to regulate exemption from work for breastfeeding purposes are superfluous.

As all EU citizens have the right to live and work throughout the EU, it is vital we afford women a minimum entitlement to maternity leave wherever they are working at the time of having a baby. Decent maternity leave is part of a wider issue of female participation in the labour market and tackling the financial implications of an ageing society. The EU goal is for 75% labour participation by 2020, and a crucial element of this will be giving all mothers the ability to take maternity leave which they can afford and then return to work. In an ageing society, where the demand for social care is increasing and the number of people providing the care is decreasing, more realistic leave such as maternity leave is needed. Women should not feel that having children is incompatible with their work – our policies need to enable care for younger and older persons. The implementation of this will not come into force for at least 5 years. Furthermore, with an increase of just 1.04% of women’s participation in the labour market, the additional costs of extending maternity leave would be covered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A better work-life balance is also one of the six priority areas of action set out in the 2006-2010 ‘Road map for equality between women and men’.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving these provisions is therefore an integral part of European policy in response to the dwindling population recorded of late. Motherhood and fatherhood are certainly inalienable fundamental rights for the purposes of social balance. It is therefore to be hoped that the review of the directive in question will be to the advantage both of working women and men who wish to take responsibility for their families.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot separate respect for a better balance between the principle of protecting health and safety from that of equality of treatment. These and other aspects persuade me to support the need, however, to leave Member States plenty of room for flexibility in establishing rules on leave when necessary.

More importantly, this report has been approved even though it goes against the measures that have recently been adopted as a result of austerity policies which favour cuts in public spending and the reduction of social rights.

The amendment to the directive is, in fact, aimed at promoting gender equality in the world of work, promoting a better balance between women’s working and private lives. Women are frequently perceived to be ‘at risk’ or ‘second choice’ individuals given their high probability of becoming pregnant or taking maternity leave. It is important to support certain forms of leave to combat certain prejudices and stereotypes. We must not, however, forget that motherhood and fatherhood are essential rights if we are to ensure the possibility of achieving a work-life balance. There are clearly certain points connected with some amendments on which I have voiced a contrary opinion. I believe, in fact, that European law must establish a general framework that offers minimum guarantees and safeguards within which Member States can be left room to decide on the most suitable measures at their own discretion. There are, in fact, differences linked to culture, to welfare and to social security systems that must be taken into due consideration, and also by virtue of respect for the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did so after lobbying from supporters and opponents. I am well aware of the financial conditions in the UK, which will be further worsened by recent budget announcements of more spending cuts. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks’ maternity leave at full salary, and 2 weeks’ paternity leave, and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy, helping reach the EU target of 75% labour participation by 2020. It improves the health of babies and protects the health and welfare of mothers. It is a step to close the existing gender pay gap. On average, in the EU, women earn 17% less than men. If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave, women are punished in their earnings for having children. It is also a positive encouragement to increase fathers' involvement in caring for children. Apart from death and taxes, birth is the only certainty in life. Our children are the future and the improvements voted through today will provide a better and more secure start to their lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, at a time of stiff international competition and budgetary stringency, we must therefore have the courage to take measures which invest in families and which take some of the pressure off the task of juggling work and family. Extending maternity leave is one of the means to that end. For this reason, I support an extension to maternity leave. However, at a time of budgetary difficulties, we have to be realistic. A twenty-week maternity leave period on full pay is not a feasible solution for our social security systems and government budgets. On those grounds, I have abstained from the final vote, even though I support an extension to maternity leave. On the other hand, I do support the Commission’s original proposal for an extension of maternity leave to 18 weeks, provided the current capped compensation scheme is enforced. I hope this proposal will stand a better chance in the second parliamentary reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is of paramount importance for workers on maternity leave to be paid their full salary and that the maternity allowance should be 100% of their last monthly salary or average salary, if the monthly salary is lower than this. This means that women will not be penalised for the period of maternity leave they have taken when it comes to their retirement pension.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the demographic trends in the EU, the birth rate needs a boost by means of specific legislation and measures aimed at contributing to a better balance between professional, private and family life. In order to help workers achieve their work-life balance, it is vital for longer periods of maternity and paternity leave to be provided, including for the adoption of children under the age of 12 months. Setting the statutory period of maternity leave to 20 weeks is in line with the recommendation made by the World Health Organisation on 16 April 2002 on a global strategy on infant and young child feeding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not simply an ethical question, but also a strategic one – the EU is currently experiencing demographic changes due to the low birth rate and greater numbers of elderly people. During these difficult times in particular, we must not frighten women away from the labour market. We need more working women if the EU wants to increase its competitiveness globally. The time has come to combat stereotypes that have taken root in society. Working women are often perceived to be ‘high risk’ or ‘second rate’ workers. It is essential, therefore, that the new leave arrangements presented in this report should help break these stereotypes. We should also offer more help to women who have been abandoned by society. EU statistics show that in Lithuania, single mothers face the greatest risk of poverty. The risk of poverty for working people in this group is 24%. It was a long road until the EU legally guaranteed gender equality. However, we must achieve even more and turn theoretical gender equality into real, tangible gender equality, which is applied in everyday life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would ask some questions of principle. First of all, is it really reasonable for us to impose, from our European ivory towers here, mandatory rules which would apply throughout the whole Union, including in Member States which, in economic terms, still have a long way to go?</p>
<p class="contents">Who is going to foot the bill for that? That brings me to my second fundamental comment: is it reasonable to impose the burden, so to speak, of these measures exclusively on the shoulders of employers? Will this ultimately not lead to a situation which is the precise opposite of that intended; that is, there will be fewer jobs available for young women, because employers will simply not be inclined to bear all on their own the consequences they risk entailing should their young female workers get pregnant?

We are well aware that in the current economic crisis, and with its increased difficulties, companies are increasingly struggling with liquidity problems, and that in many Member States, they are even exposed to an increased risk of bankruptcy. The directive which attempted to regulate this matter had a limited effect, and the proposal that we have now adopted represents an important step in setting and meeting deadlines for payment, not only in relations between the companies and public bodies, but also in the relationships that companies establish with one another. We will now have legislation that offers us greater effectiveness in meeting payment deadlines, with a clear system of penalties for late payment, and that also represents an effective improvement in counteracting the frequent abuse by the state and large companies of their dominant position over the SMEs. This directive must now be implemented quickly by the Member States, so that the serious problems caused by the establishment of long payment terms and the dragging out of payments are finally resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, according to European Commission data, late payments represent a frequent occurrence in Europe and damage competitiveness.

<p class="contents">The late payment problem is particularly keenly felt in Italy, where public authorities take 128 days on average to make payments as opposed to a European average of 67 days. The negative effects of late payments in commercial transactions are therefore considerable. I hope that this directive is implemented as quickly as possible by national governments in order to remove one of the greatest obstacles to development in the European internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Late payments represent a phenomenon which, especially in Italy, has brought tens of thousands of companies to their knees, costing the Italian economic system in the region of EUR 30 billion, according to calculations by professional associations. Leaving aside specific considerations and national situations, I am voting in favour of the report, which sets out black and white rules once and for all for both public and private operators. The economic crisis has already caused dramatic numbers of bankruptcies and closures of plants, companies and the cessation of business activities. Through this measure, Europe can really give a hand to many small businesses that are permanently strangled by bank loans due to the crisis and may already be sailing through stormy waters due to unpaid receivables that are late in arriving. When this directive is applied, at least we will avoid many cases where companies are forced out of business due to debt caused by other public or private operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new regulations on late payments in commercial transactions, which Parliament and the Council agreed on, on 5 October, should facilitate and speed up the process for companies to recover the money they are due. It is small and medium-sized enterprises which keep the economy going, even during a crisis. This is the case in every European economy. The European Parliament has ensured that all parties will be on an equal footing and that the rules will apply to all, which will benefit many European SMEs.</p>

Approval of the new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions represents a major innovation that will require appropriate preparation, above all, of the public sector, in both political and administrative terms. In political terms, so that financial and budgetary planning can take account not only of the impact of European Union rules on the Stability and Growth Pact, but now also of the impact of the new rules on late payments, which, if not satisfactorily managed, could have both a direct and reflex effect on the room for manoeuvre of governments at various levels. In administrative terms, appropriate preparation is required for the correct financial management of public bodies, beginning with the ratio between liabilities and expenditure, so that tax revenues and, hence, the people, are not weighed down by burdens such as interest payments which could have a significant effect on public finances. Finally, it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors, such as the health sector, in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings, for regular goods and services provided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures are needed to rein in late payment in commercial transactions so as to protect the good health of the European economy, avoiding situations where production structures are financially stifled and there is overcharging on financing products, thus increasing dependence on the banking sector. I would like to highlight the particular case of agricultural producers, who often see settlements that are owed to them delayed by supermarkets and distributors. The maximum period of 30 days – which may be waived to up to 60 days – for payment after services have been rendered and billed is quite reasonable for the balance of commercial relations, and it will be key to fostering a culture of timely fulfilment of commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the 30-day payment deadline as standard proposed in the report and also the introduction of a general upper limit of 60 days. I find it incomprehensible that, in many Member States, payments of public money in connection with transactions with public administrations are delayed. Late payments seriously impair the business environment and the internal market and have a direct effect on the Member States. The flat-rate compensation that has been called for, which is to be paid from the first day on which the payment becomes late, represents a tangible method of preventing this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This measure will allow approximately EUR 180 billion of liquid funds to be put back into circulation: this is the amount of the overall debt owed by public administrations to businesses throughout the EU. This is a truly important step because enterprises will be granted the automatic right to demand the payment of overdue interest and also obtain a fixed minimum amount of EUR 40 as compensation for the costs of recovering the debt. Enterprises will also, in any case, be able to demand reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred for this purpose. I believe that this initiative will serve as a spur to Member States to draw up prompt payment codes. They may, in fact, maintain or introduce laws and regulations containing provisions that are more favourable to creditors than those established by the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Late payments have become a routine practice for public authorities in many countries (and this certainly includes Italy). If the European average is 180 days from the due date, we can only imagine the extremes of lateness in some cases and the consequences for those who manage small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox is that a State demands prompt payment of duties and taxes, handing out penalties and applying interest from the first day of lateness, but ignores its own commitments when it is the debtor. The amendment we are voting for is very important, above all, at this time of severe economic difficulty, but it will not be enough on its own to resolve the problem. If individual Member States do not amend their procedures for recovering debts from public authorities in order to make them shorter and more effective, the approved provisions will be ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, all too often recently, we have seen situations of companies that are owed several millions by public authorities but are unfortunately forced to close down or declare bankruptcy due precisely to these late payments. I therefore hope that at the implementation stage, other factors are also considered, establishing a loosening of stability pact ties for public authorities and, at the same time, a gradual reduction in payment terms.

They represent a serious and dangerous problem that drags down the quality of the tender system, seriously undermining the survival of small businesses and contributing to the European economy’s loss of competitiveness. The statistics are alarming, above all, with regard to Italy, where the average payment is made at 186 days, peaking at 800 days in regional government with regard to the health sector. It is a real disgrace, which has very often forced many SMEs to close. Through this report, we are taking a great step forward by setting 60 days as the limit for payments from the public sector to the private sector. Of course, the adoption of this legislation will not solve the problem as if by magic, but it definitely represents a starting point to set off a virtuous cycle, above all, with regard to dealings with public authorities. The efficiency and immediacy of public authorities in paying invoices is an important step that will also have benefits for the European economy. I hope that the Member States, above all Italy, transpose the legislation very quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative is aiming for greater liquidity among the European Union’s companies through harmonisation. The struggle against late payments is particularly welcome in the current period of crisis, since long delays have negative repercussions on companies’ activities. The measure aims to contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market by urgently reforming the deadline required and the penalties to apply where it is not respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I welcome the legislative proposal, whose stipulation of a general deadline of 30 days for paying for transactions between companies and between companies and public entities – with the latter able to benefit from 60 days in exceptional cases – garnered widespread support in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of which I am a member.</p>
<p class="contents">I also view positively the establishment of an interest rate to be applied, where payment is late, based on the European Central Bank’s reference rate plus 8%. In my opinion, this measure equates to a strong boost for the economic activity of small and medium-sized enterprises, which often see their economic performance seriously damaged because of bureaucratic obstacles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have thrown the full weight of my support behind this agreement. Excessively long payment periods and, indeed, late payments, are a threat to healthy company management, they affect competitiveness and profitability and could ultimately jeopardise the company’s continued existence. As the current directive does not appear to be effective enough in discouraging late payments, I also support the strengthening of the existing rules. As far as maximum payment periods are concerned, we will be putting in place additional guarantees for companies because, in principle, payments have to be made within 30 days. This is of particular importance for payments between companies and government bodies. After all, from now on, Member States and governments will themselves have to lead by example. This is a question of credibility, that is, a question of European institutions in future being required to comply with the same legal deadlines as everybody else. The fact that the directive clearly stipulates that any contractual deviation from standard payment terms will only be possible for objective and fair reasons will be an important factor in its enforcement. To conclude, I hope that the fixed compensation in respect of recovery costs will force late payers onto the straight and narrow path and, better still, keep them there. That would be good for our companies and good for jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It needs to be at the forefront of our priorities, and it merits a collective response which ensures that those who find themselves in a situation of social vulnerability have a modicum of dignity. Poverty affects our young people and our elderly, but also, increasingly, our workers. 6 million jobs have been lost in the last two years alone, along with a worsening in the low level and instability of workers’ wages, even if they manage to stay in their jobs. We need a systemic approach that addresses and resolves the causes of the problems, nipping incipient problems in the bud. However, at the same time, we cannot currently provide immediate and urgent responses to their consequences. In view of this, ensuring that those who are vulnerable in our society receive a minimum income for living and are given immediate responses to enable them to get out of this situation is not only a necessity, but also a requirement that we should endorse, and one that must be achieved within a framework of responsibility and exigency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Considering the severity of the economic and social crisis and its impact on the increase in poverty and social exclusion, some vulnerable population groups such as women, children, old people and young people have experienced the negative effects of the situation more keenly.

<p class="contents">Because inequalities exist between wages and social levels in Europe, it is difficult to establish a minimum common income threshold.

The European Union must take more active measures to combat poverty and social exclusion, paying particular attention to people in precarious employment, the unemployed, families, elderly people, women, single mothers, disadvantaged children and people who are ill or who are able-bodied to varying degrees. Minimum income is one of the basic measures for combating poverty, helping to lift these people out of poverty and ensure their right to have a decent living. I would like to draw attention to the fact that minimum income will only achieve its objective in combating poverty if the Member States take concrete actions to guarantee minimum income and implement national programmes for combating poverty. Furthermore, in some Member States, minimum income schemes do not meet the relative poverty threshold. Therefore, the European Commission should address good and bad practices in the evaluation of national action plans. Hence, minimum income – the main element of social protection – is undoubtedly important in ensuring the protection of people facing poverty and their equal opportunities in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It considers that social objectives should form an integral part of the crisis exit strategy and that job creation must be a priority for the European Commission and the Member State governments, as the first step towards reducing poverty. It considers that adequate minimum income schemes must set minimum incomes at a level equivalent to at least 60% of median income in the Member State concerned. It also stresses the importance of the existence of unemployment benefit that guarantees a decent standard of living, and also the need to reduce the length of absences from work, inter alia, by making state employment services more efficient. It also stresses the need to adopt rules on insurance, so as to establish a link between the minimum pension paid and the corresponding poverty threshold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where there are differing interests, objectives will also diverge and it will be impossible to plan anything shared. Raising the living standards of those living beneath the poverty threshold is a priority. Public resources put to use in this context are, without doubt a medium-term investment since, if they are well distributed, they trigger instances of growth which feed themselves. Transferring fixed sums of money is always an uncertain business, if they are not part of a wider programme of incentives. Two situations require a different approach. The first situation, relating to social welfare, is where a worker is unable to earn enough to lead a dignified life due to physical or mental disabilities, or other related reasons. The second situation, relating to legal and economic issues, involves the rigidity of the labour market, which does not adequately equate productivity and salaries, or which does not allow you to work as much you would like or in proportion to how much you want to earn in order to lead a decent life. In these two situations, the public sector can and must intervene, leaving an incentive to hard work to be created in the others – and never the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proportion of poor employees is growing hand in hand with the proliferation of precarious, low paid jobs. In 10 Member States, the material deprivation rate affects at least a quarter of the population, with the proportion exceeding half of the population in the case of Romania and Bulgaria. All these factors add up to the EU facing a poverty problem exacerbated not only by the recession, but also by the anti-social policies implemented by right-wing governments. The minimum income can guarantee social protection for broad groups of the population who are now living in poverty. This minimum income has an absolutely paramount role to play in preventing tragic situations caused by poverty and in halting social exclusion. In order to combat poverty effectively, there is also a need to improve the quality of jobs and salaries, introduce the right to an income, as well as the wherewithal to provide social welfare benefits, pensions and allowances. 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, continuing the campaign for an inclusive society, adopted by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Yet, and this is the unrealistic part, the report is silent on the true causes of poverty: the pressure on wages brought about by the external competition of low cost countries where social dumping is practised, and by the internal competition of non-European immigration; and the explosion of unemployment, relocations and business closures caused by unfettered globalisation. It also overlooks the extremely worrying case of the impoverishment of Europe’s middle classes. Priority must be given to fighting these causes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that point, I consider its advocacy of the establishment of a minimum income threshold in all Member States to be of great value, so that everyone, whether or not they are employed, can live with dignity. I supported this resolution because, in general, it demands greater social intervention to combat the poverty suffered by millions of citizens. To that end, it demands that Member States and the European institutions establish concrete measures to promote reintegration into the labour market worthy of those people who are living in poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need a strong employment policy which would stimulate growth and competitiveness in the European social market economy and would prevent macro-economic imbalance and guarantee social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not enough to combat unemployment. Simply having work does not offer protection from poverty. The increase in precarious employment and low wages means that the percentage of workers at risk of poverty is rising.</p>
<p class="contents">According to EU reports, the incomes of more than 20% of full-time workers in Lithuania are less than 60% of average incomes, whereas the EU average is 14%. An increase in the minimum monthly wage would help reduce poverty, but would not guarantee a society without isolation. Mostly young people leave Lithuania, not just because of a lack of money and work (last year, unemployment among Lithuania’s young people reached almost 30%), but also because they feel abandoned and powerless against decisions taken that have an impact on their daily lives. This must change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The percentage of people living in poverty in Europe increased from 16% to 17% between 2005 and 2008. Across Europe, there is consensus among governments and people alike that we must fight to eradicate poverty. As we consider the Europe 2020 commitments, we must once again think about what measures can be taken to fight poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Figueiredo report, which calls for a re-evaluation of the EU’s commitments to fighting poverty and social exclusion and for the inclusion of challenging but achievable and clear objectives in the Europe 2020 Agenda.

This includes various different groups: children and young people up to the age of 17 have a higher risk of poverty, which, in specific terms, means that one in five children and young people are victims of poverty. Elderly people also face a higher risk of poverty than the general population. In 2008, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people aged 65 years and over stood at 19%. However, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in 2008 – the so-called ‘working poor’. The concept of a minimum income will contribute significantly to the social integration of groups that are at risk. However, in the drawing up of the directive, the greatest possible attention needs to be paid to maximum control and avoidance of any possible ‘exploitation’ of this social assistance. If we just look at the number of people receiving unemployment benefits, there are 23 million people who need to receive unemployment benefits in order to be able to live with dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Putting a stop to work by this special committee would give the impression that the crisis had been overcome, when the financial market situation has not been stabilised and the economic and social effects of this huge crash are still unknown, with a profound, long-term impact. All the files opened or to be opened now, namely, the Europe 2020 strategy and new directives, economic governance, financial perspectives, regulation and supervision, reform of global governance and EU representation, should start by acknowledging the crisis of the current model. Among other things, such a continuation would allow this multiple agenda to be followed up in depth, and the analysis and political recommendations to be developed based on a programme of work to be defined, and on that basis, would allow a follow-up report to be drawn up for the second half of 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The stand taken by Community officers and in the European Parliament resolution confirms that. The infighting between the imperialists cannot be overcome and will get progressively worse. The EU and G20 are making simple plans to slash grassroots incomes, to put grassroots property into the hands of big business and increase their profits, to increase the exploitation of the working class and to cut insurance and labour rights. The blanket measures decided strengthen the monopolies and shift the burden of the capitalist crisis on to the workers’ shoulders; at the same time, the EU and the plutocracy are trying to gild the pill by promoting new models of economic governance and green economies and are promising that there is light at the end of the tunnel in order to generate vain hope and wheedle assent out of society. The massive demonstrations in Greece, France, Italy and other countries are blatant proof that the choices made by the capitalist system are rejected by the workers.

In order to do so, Europe needs to overcome the problem of the ageing population. It must regulate, reorganise and supervise the Union’s financial market, improve its coordination, and use this strength to play an active role at global level. It must adopt measures to improve coordination between the different levels of governance, define a new model of economic growth that goes hand in hand with human and social development and focus on European solidarity, improving competitiveness, quality, improving education, innovation, new technologies, and on knowledge.

There is one thing, however, that is quite unconvincing: the real, deep-seated cause that unleashed the economic crisis we find ourselves in was not given adequate attention, although it is included in the recitals of the text. The cause was not contingent, but structural – and not just in economic terms. The financial crisis was caused, primarily, by the illusion, cultivated by the world’s financial and political elites, that in the third millennium, the economy and wealth could be based more on finance than on the production of goods, more on the astonishing creation of products of financial engineering than on that which is really created, produced, sold and marketed by hundreds and hundreds of millions of enterprises across the world. Unless we recognise the economic and political importance of restoring the real economy, rather than the virtual economy, the report runs the risk of making a fatal mistake: suggesting ways out of the crisis which would ultimately not be a real solution.

However, the European Union must do more. It must create added value, strengthen the instruments that have worked well (such as the currency), refine those that can be improved (such as the coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies), and create economies of scale for a rapid and long-lasting recovery.

The strengthening of economic governance, financial supervision and the power to coordinate policies and economic and monetary matters on the part of the EU institutions will ensure greater stability and a greater ability to act swiftly and efficiently. I would like to highlight the recognition of the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy, where research and innovation are central to the competitiveness of companies and job creation.

We do not need less Europe, we need more of it! Our national economies are closely intertwined – national egotisms will only intensify the crisis. This report calls for Europe to be unanimous on essential issues. Sustainable EU financial, economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action. The recommendations for action show a clear way forward: in future, businesses must have their credit ratings assessed by an independent EU ratings agency. An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax. The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be better connected to the Europe 2020 strategy. We are unambiguous in calling on the Commission to create a balance between growth, equality of opportunity and financial market stability. There is a need to reduce the taxation on work in order to strengthen investment and thus, Europe’s competitiveness. Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, need easier access to credit.</p>

In particular, the non-transparency of financial products and high-risk packaged structures, together with the United States’ soft currency policy and conflicts of interest in terms of ratings, gave rise to a global financial crisis. The Member States of the EU and their populations have plenty of food for thought in connection with the resultant economic crisis, with its growing rate of unemployment and social service sector cuts. The rescue packages were only able to arrest the downward spiral in the short term. In the long term, they only displace the underlying problems. The crisis must absolutely not be used to extend EU competences.</p>

It is crucial for Member States to apply in full the rules and decisions agreed at EU level, such as the rules and instruments of the Stability and Growth Pact.

I voted in favour of it because I consider it of fundamental importance to improve the economic governance of the European Union. The financial crisis has indeed highlighted the lack of true political and economic coordination between Member States and the inefficacy of the various control instruments. It is now therefore time for Europe to set up a more reliable legal framework that observes the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy while also implementing greater control over debt and public income, fiscal incentives for SMEs, internal market development and integration of labour markets. In the light of recent agreements, I do not, however, support the introduction of numerical rules that could prove too mechanistic for some Member States and difficult to achieve. We should not forget that toxic assets and, to an even greater extent, excessive personal debt (sub-prime mortgages) lie at the root of the financial crisis.

The main risk factor is associated not so much with matters of monetary technique, where the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job, but with economic cohesion and the link with the real economy. The problem really made itself felt during the crisis: the single currency makes less and less sense for a market that is still fragmentary and with fiscal policies that are not always sufficiently homogeneous. Considering these issues should not be, and must not be, a mere exercise or excuse for claiming legal sovereignty over matters that are currently the responsibility of individual nations. Instead, it is useful to apply consistency and a systematic approach to economic action in the face of increasingly complex situations, where currency challenges are not the same as in the past and require different instruments and objectives where the responsibilities shouldered by the technicians must be backed by ongoing and consistent monitoring as well as political direction based on a considered view of the future and an eye to resolving contingent problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, the Europe 2020 strategy should seek to promote economic growth and create jobs, as the sharp fall in GDP, the drop in industrial production and the high numbers of unemployed are a major social and economic challenge which can only be overcome by strong, harmonious and united governance. Mr Feio’s report points out ways and defines strategies towards a real strengthening of economic governance and the EU’s stability framework, with the main focus on the euro area. Examples of this include the establishment of a coherent and transparent framework for surveillance, the strengthening of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the strengthening of economic governance in the euro area, among others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the issues and solutions detailed in the report are extremely timely. The lack of information, distorted reporting and, occasionally, downright lies from EU states’ governments, has led to dreadful results. By fearfully concealing the glaring gaps in their budgets, Greece, Latvia and Hungary have shaken confidence in the euro. The European Commission and the European Parliament must strictly and effectively react to any distortion of the facts and concealment of the truth. It is essential to draw up measures in respect of dishonest politicians, on whose account the EU has ended up in crisis. In order to come out of this complicated economic situation, we must draw up not only regulations for supervision and statistics, but also a plan for overcoming the crisis. That means, firstly, clear criteria for fiscal policy, and deadlines and guarantees for taxpayers. We must also ensure that this tax legislation not be amended every day at a nod from investors. Unfortunately, today, the Latvian Government amends its regulations as the mood of the officials from the International Money Fund and the European Bank takes them. I hope that the Feio report will act as a signal to the European Commission that the time for getting down to work has come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not need mechanisms to tackle debt that are excessively automatic and pro-cyclical, which risk failing to meet the objective and, if anything, risk hindering actions to boost economic growth. Instead, I favour the adoption of surveillance mechanisms equipped with flexible, reasonable formulas, which can be easily implemented by the Member States. The results and benefits for the budget of important reforms in social and economic matters, above all, pensions reform, are not seen in the following financial year but, after a number of years in the medium and long term, in the sustainability of the public finances. In any case, these are the most important and necessary reforms. Therefore, we must give more and better consideration to the structural reforms required to stimulate competitiveness and economic growth in Europe. Competitiveness brings economic growth and growth brings more tax revenues and effective financial consolidation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it is necessary to find solutions for better and more efficient economic governance in Europe so as to prevent the already serious effects of the crisis from getting worse.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the rapporteur recommends that the European Commission establish a coherent framework for economic surveillance, strengthen the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and economic governance in the euro area, and review the EU budgetary, financial and fiscal instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is also proposed to establish a robust and credible excessive debt prevention and resolution mechanism for the euro area. Finally, it is suggested improving the reliability of EU statistics as well as the external representation of the Union in the area of economic and monetary affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, it is necessary for the Member States to fully respect the rules and decisions of the European Union. I would also stress the importance of aligning the reform with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, not least in the sense of strengthening the internal market and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises as essential motors for economic growth.</p>

The recommendations provided in this report are a good start. The rapporteur is correct to observe that we need to proceed with structural reforms regarding social policy and the integration of labour markets, and fiscal incentives to small and medium-sized enterprises. The process of reducing long-term deficits must be combined with other efforts stimulating the economy, such as improved preconditions for investments and an improved internal market, providing increased competitiveness. I also welcome the fact that the rapporteur recognises that any new proposed measures should not have a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable Member States, in particular, the Baltic countries. That would impede our efforts towards economic growth and cohesion. Last year, enthusiasm for the euro waned slightly in non-euro Member States, including Lithuania. Therefore, it is important for us to appreciate that decisions taken in the first half of the year to safeguard the stability of the euro are only temporary and will need to be supported by a better economic governance framework at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already debated one aspect this morning, but I am going to start by talking about the Instrument for Stability. This instrument was created in 2006 and is the best funded instrument in the areas of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, conflict prevention, civil post-disaster support, civil peacebuilding measures and also for justice and policing in the anti-terrorism sphere. Despite this, the size of the funding is relatively small. So far, it only amounts to EUR 1.4 billion in the financial perspective. This is not a lot of money, but it is good money, as it can be used relatively flexibly. Consideration has repeatedly been given to cutting this, but so far, we have always managed to ensure that it has not been cut in the budget. What is the mid-term review of this instrument about? What is up for debate? Well, there are a small number of points, but some of them are important in terms of content. First of all, the long-term measures under Article 4(3) are designed to make it possible to put in place measures to promote women in political processes, in particular, with regard to the media. What we are actually talking about here, therefore, is the transfer of an already very successful field into Article 4(3). So far, support has been given for media appearances by Afghan women standing for parliament. We would like to have this incorporated into the long-term measures, rather than only being in the short-term measures, so that these women can continue to be supported in this way over the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to see the peacebuilding partnership explicitly mentioned in the directive, not only in order to reward the development of formal dialogue with civil society, but also in order to bring the concept into the new era of the European External Action Service. It should not be allowed to disappear, and we therefore think it is important that it should receive specific mention.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are voting in favour of the increase in the proportion of funding for long-term measures under Article 4(3) from 5 to 10%. However, I would like to remind the High Representative, once again, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs did endorse this increase at the last minute, as we were promised that, in future, extensive measures would be undertaken under the auspices of the Instrument in the fight against landmines, cluster bombs and leftover stocks of ammunition. In other words, this increase in the long-term measures of 5% of the overall budget line to 10% was agreed on a conditional basis and we expect that you, Baroness Ashton, and the External Action Service will stick to this agreement and that the strategy paper for 2012/2013 will reflect that. This is important to us, in other words. To do otherwise would not be in the spirit of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament and the Commission prevail, however, the biggest innovation in the content of the text in the mid-term review will be the explicit expansion of the remit to include small arms and light weapons (SALWs). At this point, I want to call on the Presidency once again to accept this idea. The European Court of Justice has ruled in favour. I know that it still pains some to accept this, but I hope that, with the External Action Service, we will now perhaps be able to overcome this disjunction between the Council and the Commission and to obtain agreement on how to proceed on the issue of small arms and light weapons. I found this to be a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the issue of delegated acts. We have already discussed this issue this morning. I believe that we need a political solution in this regard and not a judicial one, which would represent a dead end. One final very brief point: when it comes to the Instrument for Stability and programming in the External Action Service – we are truly convinced that planning and programming must continue to rest with those people who have been responsible for this up to now and that those people must not be downgraded to ‘financial management’ but instead must continue to carry out content planning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank him for the work he has carried out with his customary punctuality and for the quality of his proposals, which received a favourable opinion – I would say unanimously – from the Committee on Development. For the reasons I will state, but, above all, for the work that Mr Mitchell has carried out up to today, I am convinced that the report can be voted through with a broad majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the report. During 2009, the European Commission tabled a proposed amendment to Regulation 1905/2006, which establishes a financing instrument for development cooperation. Through this proposal, the Commission asked Parliament to adopt an amendment that would allow non-governmental organisations to benefit from tax relief when operating in developing countries. We accepted the request.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the regulation for development cooperation also contains implementing rules for the European Union’s development policy. These rules provide that when the Commission accepts financing, it must follow comitology procedures. This means that Parliament can examine these financing proposals and, if the Commission oversteps its authority, Parliament may adopt resolutions to ask the Commission to change the decisions in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Merely between 2006 and today, Parliament has felt that the Commission had exceeded its executive competences in at least 12 cases, but only in three of these did the Commission in fact amend or withdraw its draft decision. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Committee on Development proposed the application of the procedure for delegated acts established by Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this procedure would mean that Parliament would have a more significant role, at least in the strategic financing decisions that the European Commission has to adopt. In effect, according to the Treaty of Lisbon, in some well-defined cases, Parliament can delegate the power to take strategic decisions to the Commission, but what could these decisions be? In our opinion, the legislature is responsible for choosing which countries the European Union should supply with development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">There is then this question over which sectors to give funding priority to: education, health, environmental protection, capacities for good government or development of small businesses? Also, how are we to ensure transparency in the management of development aid?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the choices and the subjects in which the European Parliament must play a more important role than it has in the past. In these sectors, it must be the legislature that gives precise indications to the executive. In the end, I believe that this is the way that the requests of European citizens are going. I sincerely hope for the greatest possible consensus on this report by Mr Mitchell. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The beneficiaries of this financing instrument are, in the first instance, civil society organisations, those civil society organisations and individuals which fight for human rights in the most difficult conditions, in third countries. The great advantage of this financing instrument, as opposed to other geographic instruments, is that it can be paid out without the consent of the government of the country receiving the aid. Therefore, its role is of great importance. Nevertheless, in the case of this instrument, it has not been possible to finance the costs relating to VAT payments out of Community funds. Therefore, the European Commission’s initiative suggested a technical amendment that would have helped the work and operation of civil society organisations in third countries using these funds. Since such organisations are of crucial importance for the promotion of human rights in these countries and for developing political pluralism, it is very important not to make the work of these organisations, which already face difficult situations, even more difficult. We therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative and, with the consent of my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Lochbihler, we lend it our full support. However, this is only one side of the coin.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other side is the political significance of this matter. The issue of the financial instrument has become part of the interinstitutional struggle which has been going on for a year now. It is precisely because the instrument for financing human rights is essential for civil society organisations that it is important for the European Parliament to have a part in shaping the strategic and multiannual framework programmes. What we are fighting for is that the European Parliament should have a say, insofar as it deems it necessary, in the elaboration of strategic plans for the financing instrument, through annual reviews rather than at seven-year intervals, at the time of the budgetary cycles. This is the purport of the amendments which we hereby wish to support. The Treaty of Lisbon confirmed the European Parliament’s right of oversight, which is, in effect, the institution of a ‘delegated act’ which my fellow Members have already mentioned, and which we think we need to enforce and implement in this case. The matter at hand is indeed the first example of the increased role of the European Parliament since 1 December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the discussions we have had so far and the parliamentary debates, we, the rapporteurs on the financing instruments, have reached the joint conclusion that the dossier should be sent for second reading, and we are sending a serious political message to the institutions, because now, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we should act in the spirit of the treaty. We believe that these are the very instruments for which it is most crucial that Parliament truly exercise its democratic right of oversight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barbara Lochbihler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is a very recent instrument. It can already be said, however, that it does a lot of meaningful and important work. You can see that from the feedback that we get from representatives of civil society, both within and beyond the EU. It is also a very positive complement to our human rights policy in the European Parliament and in the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on human rights often takes place under very difficult conditions. It is therefore particularly important that these instruments provide the ability for the EU to grant financial support to civil society establishments without the government in question having to give its consent, and potentially without it even having to be informed of the financial support in question by the EU. We should stress a number of times that this aid is to be retained and – where necessary – extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my co-rapporteur, Mrs Gál, I can endorse the Commission proposal that there should be a tax abatement in those countries where payments from this financing instrument are still taxed. That, too, would significantly ease the work of the NGOs in question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I see it as a constant challenge in work with this financing instrument that, on the one hand, we also have complaints or negative feedback in this connection that makes quite clear that it leads to more red tape for civil society organisations that seek support from this instrument. On the other hand, of course, there is the necessity for transparency with regard to what money is spent on and whether and how it is used. However, we should take seriously the repeated complaint by small organisations, in particular, that they are put off from using this support and this is an issue we need to tackle now.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, I see it as a challenge that it is difficult to reach a lot of local organisations in the countryside, rather than in the metropolises of the global South, in other words, to make them aware that a financing instrument of this nature exists and how they can administer it. Imagine the following situation: in a rural area where there is not always electricity, paper trails are perhaps an exception rather than the rule – that makes it necessary for particular attention to be focused on achieving these initiatives. I see an opportunity in enlarging the EU embassies on the ground at this point – and it is, of course, actually settled that there are also to be responsibilities, and staff on hand, in each local EU embassy to speak up for human rights and democracy – in these civil servants – who I will now refer to as human rights agents – intensively engaging in taking on precisely this role as a mediator and this remit to provide information and communications, and also in getting through to local initiatives that perhaps do not have the ability to communicate in English, French, Spanish or another EU language.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still far too early, at present, to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the Instrument. The timeframe is much too short – the results would not stand up very well. In a few years’ time, however, we need to very intensively devote ourselves to a comprehensive evaluation of this kind. By evaluation, I mean not only looking back at what went well, but also considering what new ideas we should adopt and how we can further develop the financing instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposals before us result from the mid-term review conducted by the Commission in 2009 at Parliament’s request. That review concluded that the instruments are working well. This is very positive and it gives a stable framework for our external relations until 2013. In some cases, the Commission proposed only technical amendments in order to bring them into line with the other instruments. We are glad that we have your support on these technical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue identified in the review was Parliament’s objections concerning aid under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) which could not be considered to be official development assistance. Here, the Commission took the views of this House fully into account. We tabled a proposal broadening the industrialised countries’ instrument to cover activities which cannot be eligible as official development assistance. This is about engaging with important bilateral partners and global players with whom the European Union has a strategic interest in promoting diversified links, such as India, China or Brazil. These countries are also interested in engaging in economic, academic, business and scientific exchanges with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This amended instrument, called ICI Plus, is a short-term solution for three years. We do not prejudge the future revision of external action financial instruments for the period after 2013. Parliament has already approved a budget for this instrument in 2010. In order to implement the budget for 2010, the instrument needs to be adopted now, so I very much welcome the work done by the rapporteurs in finding a large measure of agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the instrument for stability, the Commission proposed to include EU action against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, following the ruling of the Court of Justice in 2008. We are discussing the issues raised in Council and must find an agreed solution. I can also assure you that funding for civil society under the crisis-preparedness component of the stability instrument will further increase this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, funding is scheduled to double over the years 2011-2013 for the peacebuilding partnership. This will provide ample scope for funding civil society actions. Even more important is the share of 22% for civil society funding under the crisis response budget since 2007. This shows the capacity of NGOs in peacebuilding and crisis response. It is an excellent example of the added value the stability instrument has brought to comprehensive EU action in fragile and conflict-affected countries worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the proposals concerning the mid-term review, another amendment to the DCI was presented on 17 March 2010. The so-called Banana Accompanying Measures have a clear objective: to support the adjustment of 10 ACP banana-exporting countries to changing EU import tariffs for bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">Bananas were the subject of the world’s longest-running trade dispute. The EU had to find a solution and conclude an agreement in compliance with WTO rules. The Banana Accompanying Measures are an integral part of this agreement and the tariff reductions are already in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to thank again the rapporteur for his very constructive attitude. I think we now have an effective programme that could start as soon as we have adopted it. The tariffs are already in place and the ACP countries are urgently looking for the financial support the EU promised during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to the most debated issue. Committees have all adopted amendments in order to treat strategy papers and multiannual programmes as delegated acts under the new treaty procedure in Article 290. As you know, the Commission and also the Council do not share this point of view. We think these strategy papers and multiannual programmes do not fall within the scope of Article 290 since they do not supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we fully agree with the necessity to ensure Parliament’s strong involvement in overall strategic decisions. It is also in the interests of us all to ensure that programming can be done in a practical and smooth way. So far, Parliament has been involved through the democratic scrutiny procedure which was agreed in 2006 as regards the strategic papers and multiannual programming. Through these procedures, the Commission engages in dialogue with Parliament on the content of the strategies. This consultation process goes beyond the strict bounds of comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear: we definitely need to find a solution now. The Commission is open to discuss with Parliament in order to find a way forward that addresses Parliament’s concerns. The three chairpersons last week sent an invitation for an informal meeting between the steering committee in charge of this issue in Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome this invitation. The High Representative, a representative from the Council and myself met the steering group this morning. It was a very fruitful meeting and it very clearly confirms that it is necessary to find a solution in the shortest possible time so as to give full effect to the Treaty of Lisbon by also respecting pressing practical concerns, not least as regards the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel confident that we can find a solution if we act together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to add a few words to Commissioner Piebalgs’ comments, which the Council naturally fully endorses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner rightly drew attention to the main issue that remains unresolved, namely, Parliament’s wish to see the strategic papers and multiannual programming treated as delegated acts. I do not intend to present in detail the Council’s position here this afternoon, but I will just say that the Presidency is obviously more than happy to reach an agreement that satisfies the three institutions and that enables us to adopt the financing instruments as quickly as possible. Admittedly, I am thinking more specifically in this context of the previously mentioned ICI Plus and of the Banana Accompanying Measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with this morning’s meeting with Baroness Ashton, Commissioner Piebalgs and the rapporteurs. We feel that this meeting is a clear testament to the genuine will of our three institutions to secure an agreement, and the Presidency believes, as you know, that the current debate on the financing instruments should be kept separate from the negotiations under way between Parliament and the Council with regard to the committee procedure and delegated acts.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, you are aware that the Council is still examining these two issues and that any possible solution must indeed be endorsed by your Parliament. That is why, in view of the urgent need to adopt the financing instruments, we must take the exceptional step of developing a solution that is specifically tailored to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency will ensure, for its part, that the work which was asked to be carried out following this morning’s meeting makes swift progress and produces tangible results that will allow us to reach an agreement as soon as possible. This morning’s meeting leads us to believe that Parliament fully shares this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) was launched in the previous parliamentary term. In an opinion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs called for a financing instrument for foreign affairs to be created that had no connection with development aid but was aimed at the countries of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. The Commission then created the little instrument that is the ICI Instrument. Unfortunately, the Commission saw this as an interim solution. It replenished the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) countries but otherwise, produced little that was new and treated it as a trade instrument. The Committee on Foreign Affairs therefore put forward an amendment concerning the title of the instrument that clarified the original intention to identify it as a foreign policy instrument. The new title is a ‘Financing instrument for cooperation with countries in the Middle East, Asia, the Americas and South Africa’. We ask for your support for this. It would be worse than regrettable if the EU had no foreign policy financing instrument that was actually named as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That soft power is growing, as demonstrated by our election monitoring, observation, democracy campaigns, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament gave up 16 scrutiny instruments when it created the DCI. We had 16 core decision powers which we gave up to the Commission in order to control the DCI instrument and facilitate greater cooperation. This is working well. Now we have a stability instrument for post-crisis development. It needs to be fortified with a substantial amount of money, as there are many civil crises, civilian crises and military crises around the world. There are currently 36 civil conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same manner, I think the human rights instrument needs to have oomph. It is just not good enough for us to talk and talk and talk: we need to have people on the ground, instruments for monitoring elections, good governance and all the other things for which we require funds. I am very pleased to support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think the stability instrument has been very useful in addressing conflicts and crises and we should, therefore, focus more on prevention and follow-up. This also means robust support for civil society building. Here again, the announcement of a substantial increase in funds for peacebuilding is to be welcomed.</p>

At the same time, it is crucial to ensure that the different EU instruments and programmes are used coherently and with an understanding of complementarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Treaty has to make the EU more coherent and efficient. We have understood in this Parliament the need for technical modifications. The question is rather about the political solution, as has been pointed out. This concerns delegated acts and the European Parliament’s right to scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I am encouraged by the statements of openness on the side of both the Council and the Commission.

It is right that this instrument is managed by the Committee on International Trade because, above all, it relates to cooperation with industrialised countries and emerging countries, so there is a certain difference compared to other instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I think it is necessary to emphasise the role of Parliament. We have lost too much time in a tug of war with the Council and the Commission on an obvious issue after the Treaty of Lisbon. We must defend the centrality of Parliament, in regard to both delegated acts and executive acts. Secondly, I think it important to underline the strategic importance of this whole game and, thirdly, the need to intensify collaboration with developing countries and emerging countries, without taking money away from the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make an effort, within the budget of the European Union, to divert more resources to the poorest countries, bearing in mind that the problems with emerging countries are mostly to do with rules, rather than financing. In any case, innovation must also be supported, but with additional resources that have not been taken away from the poorest countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All these instruments are of a relatively recent date and are, moreover, of quite an original nature. We have previously had nothing comparable and, elsewhere in the world or in other international or supranational institutions, there are, in fact, very few models of the kind of instruments that the European Union is developing. Because of the groundbreaking nature of this body of instruments, we wisely agreed that we would evaluate them after only a few years and, where necessary, adjust them. That is what is keeping us busy here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are other important changes which have occurred in the meantime. These days, we have a High Representative who is also Vice-President of the Commission. During this sitting, we have been asked to approve the basic texts on the subject of the European External Action Service, which is, so to speak, a diplomatic arm of the European Union. That, too, is a very important innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, the powers of this House have been considerably extended. We have, so far, had ample opportunity to exploit those powers and, as tends to be the case with young institutions, you push as far as you can to assert those new powers to the maximum. Therefore, we are currently discussing with the other institutions where exactly lines need to be drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased at what both Commissioner Piebalgs and the President-in-Office have said about there being a will to reach an agreement. Given that I used to be part of the executive power in my country in a former life, I understand all sides of the argument and I hope that we reach an agreement. I also dare to hope that this House will not overplay its hand, as the English sometimes say.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, as regards the Instrument for Stability – I still have a few seconds – I would like to say that I very much welcome what Commissioner Piebalgs said, that, indeed, the intention is that we should concentrate, among other things, on the fight against the trafficking of small arms and light weapons. That the intention is to involve NGOs more closely in the working of the Instrument for Stability and to make full use of the even more groundbreaking body of instruments for peacebuilding. If that becomes a reality, you will be able to count on the full support of our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is because Parliament has the duty to control where the Commission spends the money and whether it is spent as intended, in this case, on Official Development Assistance (ODA).</p>
<p class="contents">We have, in the past, found bad examples of where money was not spent in accordance with ODA criteria or where we found that it did not comply with the goal of poverty eradication. Merely having the right of consultation, our proposals and our ideas were not taken up. This clearly shows that we need a stronger position. We need the power to codecide on where the money goes.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only the Commission, but we too as a Parliament have an obligation as regards policy coherence in development. We also need to make sure that the money that is spent goes in the right direction and that other policy fields also work towards the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also has a responsibility towards the citizens of the European Union. We must better control where the money is spent, namely, on poverty eradication. European citizens are in favour of development aid. They are even in favour of providing more development aid – as surveys have shown – but we also have to show clearly how we spend it and that we spend it to the benefit of poor people.</p>

<p class="contents">My group, the ECR Group, strongly believes that properly structured new EU financial instruments are therefore essential. They ensure a more efficient and effective way of disbursing EU taxpayers’ money and enable Parliament, particularly post-Lisbon, to scrutinise spending and strategic policy in a more open and transparent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">This democratic accountability is vital, especially at a time when Member States are themselves making severe cuts to their national expenditures. Investment and development, democracy and human rights are potentially an important way to support, through soft power in particular, the EU’s wider foreign policy goals and could also contribute to reducing inward migratory pressures on the EU’s external borders. Strong mechanisms to prevent corruption and misuse of EU money are, however, fundamental and we should also be careful not to force our own western liberal values, in particular, so-called reproductory rights, on to others ill-equipped or reluctant to absorb them under the guise of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service. I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union’s far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Parliament’s cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments. Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier. All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is relevant to the debate today because it emphasises the key point. The European Commission has no money. All the Commission’s money comes from the taxpayers of the Member States or, to be precise, the taxpayers of the 14 Member States which are net contributors. Even if the Commission gets its own resources some time, which, on the basis of the votes earlier today, looks depressingly likely, the money spent by the Commission would still be money from taxpayers.</p>

Financial aid is difficult to obtain due to its complexity, while the monitoring systems continue to be designed in a less than optimal way. One example of this is pre-accession aid, which, as we all know, is awarded to potential candidate countries, but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established. I hope that, in this connection, the EU has learnt from its overhasty enlargement of 2007. When it comes to the Instrument for Stability and development cooperation, the budgetary funds far too often do not reach, or only partially reach, the local institutions for which they were intended. This is partly due to the weak institutions in the recipient countries, but it is also due to faulty incentive structures and a lack of documented accountability. There is food for thought in the fact that, according to an IMF study, the public expenditure of 33 countries is more than 50% dependent on international development aid. When it comes to financial aid from the EU, of whatever kind, the monitoring needs to be tightened up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the trialogue, in particular, there was not always agreement, but we did enjoy a constructive atmosphere for discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Expanding the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories will give the EU the opportunity to establish cooperation with the crucial emerging and developing economies on an equal footing. This includes educational exchange programmes under the Erasmus Mundus scheme, and supporting entrepreneurial or cultural cooperation, and is something that I very much welcome. There is one point that I would like to draw your attention to, and that is that, given the EU’s current financial situation – and that of every Member State – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not find it acceptable to demand new, not currently available funding to realise the measures just described. There needs to be a financial evening out with the financing instrument for development cooperation, the resources of which were only intended to be for all the emerging and developing economies. I have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the PPE Group that makes it possible to achieve such a financial equilibrium.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say a quick word about the delegated acts. This is an important issue – it has already been mentioned twice this morning. There is absolutely no doubt, as far as I am concerned, that Parliament must have a right of supervision and veto over the whole package on the financing of foreign cooperation currently under discussion by means of delegated acts. The spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon needs to make itself felt here. There can be no compromise on the issue of whether delegated acts are or are not to be included in the financing instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the only instrument that we can now mobilise to help those who stand up for democracy and human rights in countries where basic freedoms are restricted. We can do it without the consent of their respective governments. Obviously, such a valuable instrument must be under proper European Parliament scrutiny, and this is why we demand the delegated acts procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should realise that this instrument is rather limited in terms of the funding available, and a sizeable part of it actually pays for the EU election observation missions: 22% for the period 2011-2013. This means that the budget allocated to the European instrument for democracy and human rights must be significantly increased.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to point out a new tool which the European Parliament should help create, and which this instrument could fund in order to assist even more efficiently and with more flexibility the people who often risk their lives in fighting for democracy, rule of law and human rights in countries with dictatorships or oppressive regimes, and in countries seeking a transition towards democracy, but where they meet violent anti-democratic forces and where they need much more assistance in terms of building capacities to defeat these anti-democratic forces.</p>

I very much doubt that the US model is more effective than the European one. The US model, when it deals with human rights, is essentially selective and completely self-serving because, in truth, the US model is first and foremost about active bilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate my colleague, Charles Goerens, on his work, since he has succeeded in strengthening the development dimension of the approach, and I would, of course, like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for the careful and favourable attention he has paid to this request.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to make three brief observations. Firstly, dismantling the Community preferences system too quickly can and will have dramatic consequences in some ACP countries that still export bananas. Some of these consequences will directly affect the ability of ACP countries to promote sustainable development. That is why I would like to argue in favour of a reasonable and slightly flexible interpretation of the criteria for allocating aid. Aid should be allocated as a priority to those ACP countries that wish to maintain their banana sector because of the latter’s impact on their country’s sustainable development. In this respect, it would have been helpful – this was requested but not obtained – to have already had an ex ante impact assessment on the situation of banana exporting countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two other general observations, and I will certainly come back to these in the following weeks. From my point of view, the best way to channel this aid is, without a doubt, general budgetary aid wherever possible, and sectoral aid wherever desirable. It would have also been helpful perhaps to have had a debate on the quantity of aid and on honouring the commitments made in 2005 by Member States. This is central to the debate. Moreover, what I have heard from some fellow Members here is deeply worrying. Evidently, selfishness is king. I must say that this is rather surprising.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to answer a number of questions, I would also like nonetheless to revive the idea of including the European Development Fund in the budget, since this would obviously enable us to monitor the Commission’s political action directly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All these reports concerning the promotion of democratic and human rights worldwide and financing instruments for development cooperation must be seen in the context of the chilling statement made yesterday in this very Chamber by the United Nations Secretary-General. He said that 65 million more human beings will be plunged into extreme poverty in our world this year alone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the harsh reality that flies in the face of fine words by government and the Commission. Outside the doors of this Chamber, huge banners with EU logos proclaim: Halt poverty. At the same time, the EU Commission – and indeed the major groups in this Parliament – are pushing neoliberal economic policies that slash budgets and public services, savaging the living standards of ordinary people, while transferring massive resources in bailouts to banks and speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">On financing development cooperation, the Commission congratulates itself on the new tariff reductions for bananas agreed with Latin America banana producers, but, in reality, this new arrangement is for the benefit of powerful transnational corporations. The huge banana exporters, like Chiquita and Del Monte, will gain hugely but African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and small producers will be devastated. Of course, the subsidy to small banana growers who face ruin because of the new agreement must not come from established social funds but from elsewhere in the EU budget.

I feel that this is not the right time to levy these taxes, while Europe is sinking into recession and workers are losing their jobs, their purchasing power and, more importantly, their insurance rights. Instead of giving to European consumers, we are taking away from them. It would appear once again that, in our efforts to achieve budgetary discipline, we have put aside our plans for growth and that, in applying economic theory, we have forgotten political theory.</p>
<p class="contents">We must convince European citizens, by example, that we are taking care of them in the best possible way. At this particular juncture, therefore, we should not behave like Marie-Antoinette. I therefore have two specific proposals: firstly, our pay as MEPs should be cut by EUR 1 000 in 2011 and we should each use that money to recruit a young unemployed European citizen from our own country. Secondly, we should cut our travel costs by flying economy class. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thus, while ordinary people in Greece, France, Ireland and Great Britain are having their societies ripped apart by cuts and their backs broken by taxes, the Scholz report will add EUR 176 million to the EUR 172 million already committed to help third-world capitalists gobble up even more of our jobs.

This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences. Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas. Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition. Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that. Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We consider that democracy is a human achievement that needs to be safeguarded. Is, however, democracy as we know it the democracy that we want to – and must – export? I am absolutely certain that the first thing we need do is to improve democracy at home. When we have a country in which abstentions exceed 50%, how can we talk of democracy? When millions of people are unemployed, can we talk of democracy? When, instead of being expressed through elected representatives, democracy is mainly expressed through and, at the same time, is controlled by the media, then what can we say? Is this the sort of democracy that we can be proud of and want to export?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there truly are nations that need help in order for their rights to win proper support and acceptance from their governments. Surely, however, this should be done with caution, following lengthy investigation of any potential negative, rather than positive, results?

With this, of course, also comes an increase in responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a particular responsibility in all sorts of relations with countries that are not democracies, whether it be in relation to aid or trade. Europe and the EU should and must take the lead. The EU must show the way. Among the financing instruments that we are now debating, there are building blocks that provide us with the prerequisites to really make a difference. The prerequisites are there, but this does not automatically mean that we will succeed. In order for every euro in aid to have the optimum effect, our development work needs to be constantly permeated by democracy promoting initiatives and opinion forming. This may seem self-evident but, in fact, it is not for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Nations, it is the EU that takes up the cudgels. It is the EU that stands up in the negotiations against totalitarian regimes, and it is we who consistently and unswervingly stand on the side of the vulnerable, and, of course, that is how it should be. It is therefore disappointing to see that, globally, the direction of change is not the one we would like when it comes to democracy and human rights, and I have a feeling that some Members of our Parliament do not fully appreciate the importance of democracy as the most significant and fundamental building block for development.</p>
<p class="contents">At regular intervals in the Committee on Development, we see attempts to initiate texts that subtly, between the lines, or even quite openly, give a degree of concession to totalitarian regimes. It was recently claimed, for example, that the main problem in dictatorships is that there is a risk that healthcare will be privatised. The fact that widespread starvation has never occurred in a democracy is seldom pointed out by anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This attitude is quite simply not tenable. In order for our financing instruments within the aid budget to function in an optimum way, we must place the promotion of democracy at the centre of all our external relations, and this must not only happen in formal contexts and verbally, without any practical action being taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I myself come from one of the only European regions to produce bananas, I can only show solidarity with the ACP producers in question. Solidarity, first and foremost, because a strong historical link unites the European Union to these countries, and we should do our utmost to ensure that they, too, are able to maximise the benefits of globalisation, of which they are, more often than not, the first victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity, also, because the trade concessions generously granted by the Commission to the WTO are in danger of dealing a fatal blow to this agricultural sector in our ACP partner countries. Solidarity, but definitely not naivety, lastly, since the proposal for a BAM regulation as tabled by the Commission put much too much emphasis on the economic diversification aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the loss of tariff preference that resulted from the WTO agreement, this programme’s main goal is clearly to ensure the sustainability of ACP banana exports and hence, to help make them competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, let us be honest, the funds set aside by the BAM are by no means enough and do not extend over a long enough period to make diversification happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that, if we are aware of the urgency of the situation, we can accept these accompanying measures being financed through the extensive redeployment of heading IV of the budget. The Council must be responsible and work towards finding a viable solution for the multiannual financing of this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be a political tool of the European Union to a greater degree, as it has a huge potential to support and promote democracy. However, this would require a change in the way this European financial instrument is approached. To date, the question of supporting democracy has been overshadowed by the issue of human rights. Of course, these are extremely important, but I believe that supporting democracy itself, which is a different matter, should be given a much higher status and much greater weight.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must also strengthen non-governmental institutions in countries with authoritarian governments. We should focus on grassroots democracy in those countries, building it from the bottom up. This means focusing on civil society organisations which offer innovative methods of expanding the public space. In order to succeed in this, we must first introduce regular monitoring of the impact of those organisations which receive European funding. We must also, as the organisations themselves agree, set up a forum at which regular meetings are held to facilitate communication between donors and recipients, and not only donors from the European Union, but also from elsewhere. Our application forms need to be simplified. At present, they are simply beyond the understanding of many.

The reality is entirely different, and I have to say that the way they have been treated throughout this report is quite simply unacceptable. We must first and foremost bear in mind the fact that the banana sector is vital for many African and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, despite this, they have made the effort to accept, at the WTO, an agreement which lowers the European customs tariff to EUR 114 per tonne, in order to put an end to a long-standing dispute with Latin American producer countries. However, the Commission seems to have forgotten to inform them of the bilateral negotiations under way with these same countries on a far lower tariff: EUR 75 per tonne. In other words, the commercial consequences of these agreements will be deeply felt in a context in which the lion’s share of the European banana market is already held by multinationals based in Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, during the last plenary session of the ACP-EU Assembly in Tenerife, all the members agreed to adopt as one a declaration calling for support measures tailored to producers’ needs to be implemented without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in Brussels and Strasbourg, I see that, unfortunately – and this is no surprise – the right is backtracking and even opposing any reference to this declaration. I am tired of this double-dealing, but, above all, I fear that this weariness is shared by our historical partners, who no longer believe in our will to truly support their development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The OECD countries pump over USD 100 billion per annum into development aid. This means that they make up 90% of the publicly funded development aid in the world. The EU is the world’s biggest donor of development aid. However, every year, EUR 3 billion worth of aid gets lost due to qualitative defects. What can be done about this? In future, we expect monitoring that ensures that the funds are employed in a way that is traceable and durable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also expect the recipient countries to be reminded of their obligations, for example, with regard to cooperation in the repatriation of illegal migrants. It is absolutely possible to use development aid as a means of applying pressure to conclude readmission agreements. Uncooperative countries of origin for millions of illegal migrants must not be allowed to continue to look forward to millions in development aid. I expect clear words in this regard at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit in November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is, in fact, releasing substantial funds. These funds should not be made inaccessible because procedures are too complex. Above and beyond the flexibility given to these instruments, however, I would like to stress the importance of really ensuring that small organisations and structures, too, can benefit from these grants, because nowadays, we are unfortunately too often faced with situations in which only large NGOs benefit from them, and only for a short period.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I believe that prioritising small NGOs over longer periods could produce far better results. These days, there are many small grass-roots organisations that do excellent long-term work at local level.

In a way, it very much coincides with yesterday’s speech here by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, when he clearly said that the EU and the United Nations share responsibility in this world in the fight against poverty, the fight against climate change and the fight against nuclear proliferation. It is a common challenge that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, our citizens today are not too worried about this issue because they believe that we take care of this issue and also promote our values. Transnistria was mentioned. It is not thousands of kilometres away from us; it is very close. Concerning peace and security, it is true that we do not have too much conflict, but that is because we have an extremely active external policy in order to prevent any conflict as soon as it starts.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have experience that we can be proud of. Financial instruments definitely help us to address these challenges. I believe that today’s debate was basically very positive about the experience that we have had from the financial instruments. At the same time, I would emphasise that we have full accountability, and that it is taxpayers’ money. Whenever we start a project, there are ex ante controls and there are ex post controls afterwards. There is a Court of Auditors of the European Union that looks not only at whether the money is spent correctly, but also at the political reasoning behind this. The Committee on Budgetary Control is quite tough with regard to any Commission spending, so I can assure you that taxpayers’ money is very much valued and is spent with good purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">We always discuss how to be more effective, but I can assure you that we follow policy objectives that have been agreed with this House. Today’s debate has already started the next debate, because ambition concerning the revision of financial instruments has been rather humble until now. We wanted just to adopt them until the year 2013, with some particularities.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you address the challenge for countries that will have particular issues because of our agreement on the banana trade. It is necessary to adopt banana accompanying measures as soon as possible. It is not only our credibility which is at stake; countries really face a challenge. That is the reasoning behind it. I believe that this House was very supportive of it. We have started to debate what will happen after 2013, and I would draw your attention to the fact that this is the beginning of the debate. We are not prejudging what will happen after 2013. The budget review was adopted by the Commission yesterday; it will be considered in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to discuss the Green Paper on modernisation and development policy within the Commission. I believe my colleagues will also come forward with issues. We need to agree on policy priorities and also financial instruments well in advance so that we do not need to make an adjustment later if we find that there is not sufficient money in one instrument and we try to cover some of the priorities with reallocation.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that this is not the best possible way, but it means that before adjusting the financial framework, we should agree what we would like to achieve, which instruments should be applied, and what scope we would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that, as a Commissioner, I have two budgetary authorities. One is definitely this House, but the other is the Council. I believe this means that, for all the scrutinies that we will carry out and on which we should agree, we need to follow the letter of the Lisbon Treaty, with the political willingness to find the right compromise so that democratic scrutiny can be fully emphasised to show that it is efficient, swift and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly what we have discussed today in the meeting that I mentioned in the first speech. I have every reason to believe that we will find the necessary compromise. It will not be easy; it will require a lot of political will. On the Commission side, we definitely have the political will because I know what the stakes are, particularly for some of the measures where we need a swift conclusion of this process.</p>

<p class="contents">As regards the stability instrument, we have seen that it is wonderful because it is more flexible than other instruments, but that also occasionally leads to misuse for food crises, for humanitarian and natural disasters. That should really be stopped and we should clarify, for the period after 2013, that this is really for conflict situations, and maybe add more flexibility to other instruments in order to address more emergency situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there was another thing that I would like to highlight. The recent British defence review puts conflict prevention at the core of the External Action Service. I find that quite interesting and correct. I think it is the right way forward to say that the External Action Service should become the hub for conflict prevention, in the interest of internal coherence. The tools that it needs include the stability instrument. I see others, like a mediation cell, being created within the appropriate structures. I think we should build on this when we look at the period after 2013, and ask: What do we need in terms of money and resources so as to really become a driving force for conflict prevention? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your comments have actually drawn attention to the same question that we, the rapporteurs, have had to grapple with in the past period. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his constructive approach to this debate. What we have seen today is that – as almost all speakers confirmed – the European financing instrument for democracy and human rights is a very important and perhaps the only instrument of the European Union for the democratisation of third countries and the defence of human rights designed in such a way that civil society organisations can receive it directly. It can be paid out directly to organisations working in the field, without the support of the third country. This is why it is important and we consider it necessary to promote every technical facilitation that will enable these organisations to access the aid that is often crucial to their survival.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, and for this very reason, since this programme involves such a priority area and we are talking about an instrument that is intended directly for these NGOs and civil society organisations, it is important that Parliament has a say in the elaboration of the strategy and long-term programme, and it is essential that Parliament should see how these funds are used, and not only at the end of the seven-year financial framework. This is why we consider it important to emphasise Parliament’s democratic right of oversight and its right to have a say. I believe that a joint solution will be found, especially after the meeting this morning with both Mrs Ashton and Commissioner Piebalgs, and I, too, seriously believe that if the political will is there, the legal obstacles will be overcome. This, then, is the view we should take as we look ahead to the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Occasionally, MEPs were invited to take part in an exchange of opinion between the Commission and civil society on specific programmes. The debate, too, has shown that there are hardly any problems in administering the instrument. That does not mean, however, that we can rule out occasional problems in application in future. That is why Parliament’s right of supervision is very important. However, the one point on which we have not been able to reach agreement so far is the establishment of a binding right of supervision for Parliament, which the Treaty of Lisbon allows for. I therefore join the multiple others who have expressed the hope that we reach a compromise – in other words, a political solution – quickly and one that takes full account of Parliament’s rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The debate today has demonstrated that financial issues, the use of budget resources, planning and the issue of the political control of the instruments are highly political issues. To close this debate, I would therefore like to summarise what form the instruments are to take. How we realise them has much to do with how European citizens perceive the European Union and thus, also with how the use of resources for one instrument or another is accepted by citizens. I can therefore only repeat what I said to Baroness Ashton and to you, Commissioner, this morning during the briefing of the steering committee for the working group on delegated acts, which was that I think there is an urgent need to quickly reach a solution in relation to delegated acts, whilst preserving the legal and political responsibility of the legislator and the Commission. The Instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges, the Erasmus Mundus programme, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. The aim is for particular consideration to be given, here, to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the following to say to the empty benches facing me, including because Mr Griffin is no longer there: I believe this to be a very important contribution towards the European Union’s openness to the rest of the world and towards its acceptance, both by its own citizens and by other countries with which we enter into exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, we have started this financing instrument on its way through successful compromise negotiations between the Council and Parliament and attempted to adapt it to the challenges of the future and to reach agreement on all the issues of content. I hope that, with the vote in this House tomorrow, we will take a decisive step forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the general trend of reducing trade preferences, from which ACP countries have benefited until now, is not going to change any time soon. Negotiations under way are already aiming at tariffs close to EUR 75 per tonne of bananas, whereas we are working here on the basis of EUR 114 per tonne.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission had no other choice but to agree to negotiate a tariff reduction agreement with the countries competing with the banana-exporting ACP countries. The alternative would have meant leaving the Dispute Settlement Body to sort out the problem. Personally, I believe that a negotiated solution is the lesser evil for ACP countries, and this is the spirit in which we must also approach the Banana Accompanying Measures, since they would not have been the automatic outcome of a judgment by the Dispute Settlement Body.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, since the world is not going to end in 2013, which is the year when the Banana Accompanying Measures will end, we continue to believe that it is important to start preparing right now for the period after 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the EUR 114 tariff paid at the borders of the European Union on each tonne of bananas is already soon going to be exceeded in practice. I said at the outset that we were already talking about EUR 75 per tonne.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is wise, therefore – and this is my fourth point – to preserve the European Parliament’s supervisory powers. We must ensure that the right to oversee strategy papers, laid down in Article 290, does not become a dead letter. I think we can safely say that, in this instance, our cooperation with the Commission has been extremely fruitful. This Parliament is not a troublemaker; on the contrary, it is forever enriching the debate and helping the Commission move forward on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, this is a personal observation, but I am making it as rapporteur, even so. Once more, we are witnessing here a squabble between emerging countries, on the one hand, and least developed countries, on the other. Moreover, were it not for the European Union acting as an ally of the weak in order to mitigate the likely effects of a trade agreement, in all its brutality, the least developed countries would feel even more isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">I invite the Commission to start thinking right now about the period after 2013, because I believe that the measures which will be decided on now and which, I hope, will come into force before too long, will suffice to make banana production sustainable in the countries concerned. I hope that these measures can help ensure the long-term survival of the banana sector and that those who are unable to keep producing can find alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, post-2013, as I have already said, water will continue to flow under the bridges over the Rhine and the problems with regard to the banana sector will still be there. We already need to be thinking about a post-2013 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on the current situation in Ukraine. I should like to make my remarks in the light of three important upcoming events: the EU-Ukraine Ministerial meeting which will take place in Luxembourg on 26 October, the local elections which will take place on 31 October, and the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit which will be held in Brussels on 22 November.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent times, Ukraine has enjoyed a high level of political freedoms. Successive elections have been recognised as having been conducted in accordance with international standards. Ukraine has developed a dynamic and diverse civil society and media environment. There have been consistent improvements across the board with regard to respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence of these developments and of the commitment of successive governments to the path of closer ties with the European Union, relations between the European Union and Ukraine have acquired considerable momentum. This is reflected most clearly in the ambitious and far-reaching European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement which we are currently negotiating, and which aims at achieving the twin goals of political association and economic integration with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">President Yanukovych’s government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms in recent months, which should be commended. These include the adoption of a public procurement law, which should play an important role in the fight against corruption and in increasing competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of a gas sector reform law, which paves the way for Ukraine’s imminent accession to the Energy Community Treaty, as well as the agreement it recently reached with the IMF for a standby agreement, are also critical steps in securing macro-financial stability, transparency and a return to growth. These reforms go in the right direction and must be sustained.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ukrainian Government has also managed to achieve a level of stability which has eluded Ukraine’s political establishment in recent years. This is an important and necessary development in ensuring effective governance of the country. Nonetheless, we are concerned at consistent and widespread reports of a deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine. Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect of these fundamental values is essential. They are the best guarantors of individual freedoms. They ensure a genuine competition of ideas. They are an essential component of truly open, innovative and competitive societies.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 October, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court handed down a judgment which overturned constitutional changes made after the 2004 Orange Revolution. This decision only increases the need for Ukraine to achieve wider constitutional reform through an inclusive constitutional reform process and, to a great extent, takes up a key theme of the European Parliament’s resolution of 25 February this year. Such a process should seek to establish an effective and lasting constitutional system of checks and balances in accordance with European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union and our Member States, respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are fundamental principles that bind us together. They are principles that cannot be compromised, so too for our relations with key partners such as Ukraine. The pace and depth of our rapprochement with Ukraine will be determined by full respect of these values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be able to discuss economic reforms in November in connection with the EU-Ukraine summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to talk about intimidation by the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press and the ability to take part in the elections unhindered. Developments like this cannot be balanced out by positive news in the economic sphere. ‘Economic prosperity through authoritarian rule’ is a Chinese approach, not a European one. Those who hold power in Ukraine today should not be allowed to believe that they can escape just because the broad European public takes no notice or because the previous government admittedly did have failings in relation to good governance and combating corruption. These things are true, yet there was no atmosphere of being watched, there were no visits from the secret police, as has been experienced by the rector of the Catholic University of Lviv and by young people involved in NGOs and opposition parties. Cutting off power to businesses, seizing computers, occupying party offices on the grounds of supposed risks of attacks – the whole gamut of the <span class="italic">déjà vu</span> is on show in Ukraine. There is method to it. The secret police is headed by Mr Khoroshkovsky, who actually runs a media empire and is now also a member of the committee to appoint the most senior judge in the country. That, too, distances Ukraine from Europe. There is little left of equality of opportunity in the political contest before the municipal elections. The opposition is being partially excluded from the elections, while puppet parties are being spontaneously formed and authorised to take part in the elections by compliant local authorities. In Kiev, the district councils are being unceremoniously abolished so that no elections are taking place there – the governing party knows that it will not win there are the moment. The power vertical has the objective of achieving control over regions that have previously been inclined to disagree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We put forward our European experience as an alternative. Our Member States took important decisions in democratic consensus between government and an opposition ready to take responsibility – for European reforms, for the rule of law, for a competitive market economy, for European integration. We want Ukraine to continue down this road with us.</p>

<p class="contents">A new government was elected through free and fair elections, recognised by all of us. Today is the right time to leave this government to deliver, and not to prejudge its achievements or non-achievements from the first minutes of its mandate. The real problem of this debate is a problem we have here. We were too fast in dividing that country into pro-westerners and pro-easterners. Now we have a problem, since the pro-westerners are not in power, in recognising the pro-easterners’ capacity to deliver and to help the country promote its European expectations. This is the real problem with this debate today and we should understand that the real pro-Europeans are the pro-Ukrainians – those who are able to bring the rule of law, democracy and European modernisation to their country.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude simply by asking colleagues to decide to postpone the resolution we are expected to adopt, because the Ukrainians are facing elections and they face negotiations with us.

<p class="contents">It is just as difficult for Ukraine, which treats Europe one day as an ally, another day as a problem. This is why I believe we should be pragmatic, recognise the realities on the ground, and find common items on our agendas to reach agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic cooperation has always been Europe’s most powerful engine for greater integration and Europe has owed its success to this pragmatic approach since 1956.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must continue to focus on both institutional and economic reforms to be undertaken by Ukraine in parallel. This two-track approach is the only one possible if we want to create a virtuous circle that could lead to democratic stability in this country and in the Eastern neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">A priority should be to support a healthy business environment and the achievement of a functioning market economy in Ukraine by encouraging their property and VAT reforms and their efforts to combat high-level corruption, among other priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I see the association agreement as a powerful instrument of reform, and it is why we should continue our negotiations on the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area and on Ukraine’s accession to the Energy Community Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, I welcome Ukraine’s accession to the WTO, which should be seen as an important step in Ukraine’s acceptance of European economic standards.</p>

There are more and more reports about the repression of the freedom of expression of journalists, regular threats to committed individual members of the NGOs and people working for democratic development. The role of the secret police, too, gives real cause for concern. However, I do not believe that the altercations about freedom of the press and democratic development in general begin with the last election, rather – and I have said this here often – all the leading players in Ukraine have repeatedly abused their power for purposes including bringing their own interests to fruition. This abuse is getting worse and that really must concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to adopt this resolution without being worried about certain economic developments in Ukraine. I am watching with just as much concern how Russia’s influence on the Ukrainian economy, its energy sector, but also other sectors, has been systematically expanded. I would therefore also advise that we do not have to vote tomorrow but instead after the delegation has visited Kiev – a delegation is going there the weekend after next – and before we have the summit here, after careful preparation in all areas to agree what the European Parliament’s position actually is regarding the situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">I have gone down this path from the pre-democratic times to the new times with numerous Ukrainian friends. Ukraine was on a very good path. It was our impression that the last elections took place in accordance with democratic conventions. If the situation should not now improve, but instead worsen, we should nonetheless consider very carefully how we intervene and how we do not intervene. In any case, I would advise against making a decision before our next visit to Ukraine. Our voice will be louder if we bring up the debate on the things about which we have spoken in the resolution over there.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I really am concerned. I am receiving a lot of reports that everything is heading in a negative direction. However, we would be doing ourselves no favours if we were to rule out debate on the ground over there and make too fast and too hasty a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we always stressed the fact that the aim of our involvement in Ukraine was not to support any particular political force, but to help make Ukraine a democratic and free country. Today, we should remember that the European Parliament did not play a role in Ukraine’s internal politics, but acted as a guardian in two very important ways: on the one hand, by upholding and assisting Ukrainians’ European aspirations and, on the other, by upholding democracy, human rights and all the values we regard as European values in Ukraine. I say that the tone of the proposed resolution is not one which will help those who regard themselves as friends of Ukraine. Today’s resolution will only push Ukraine closer to Russia, and to those who say, ‘you will see, there is no room for us in the West. It is closing its doors to us’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be open to Ukraine, we have to tell it what European standards are, and we must keep up the pressure to ensure they are observed, while, on the other hand, we must absolutely prevent Ukraine from returning to the East. I would like to ask Mr Gahler, whose involvement in human rights and international politics I value greatly, why he finds it necessary to use such damning words about Ukraine.

Foreign investors are said to fear the lawlessness that reigns in this country where, last week, no fewer than 3 000 buildings and companies were expropriated through fraud and violence. This process involves wide boys acting in cahoots with the country’s politicians to dupe entrepreneurs.

<p class="contents">Commissioner Füle, are you aware of these major concerns which affect European investors in Ukraine and what specific steps has the Commission taken to protect legitimate, legal European business interests in the Ukrainian economy? That would be showing commitment. We have nothing against Ukraine.

When, however, even the financial markets judge the new government to be more stable and predictable than the government put in place by the Orange Revolution, that is probably a sign that democracy according to Western – according to our European – preconceptions cannot be transposed on a one-to-one basis to every country, including to those of the post-Communist sphere of influence. The current decision by the Constitutional Court would indeed strengthen the position of the President and weaken that of the parliament, of that we can be sure. Those who know the region say that a <span class="italic">de facto</span> presidential system was already in place before the <span class="italic">pro forma</span> court judgment. Growing restrictions on the freedom of the press and of opinion put Mr Yanukovych’s reassurances that democratic standards will be maintained in doubt. If the President succeeds in both reinforcing his own power base and achieving an economic recovery by carrying out central reforms in Ukraine, which is, of course, one of the poorest countries of this continent, he will perhaps keep himself on his presidential throne for longer and I believe that that would be something that, plainly and simply, the European Union would have to take note of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present ruling élite has been exercising power since the election of President Yanukovych and much of what has been done points in the direction of favouring the concentration of power.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more striking if we recall the results of the presidential elections which gave Yanukovych a small majority and demonstrated that he had strong support in the south and east of the country only. Yet – and this is the striking feature of Ukrainian politics currently – there has been a steady movement in the direction of marginalising alternative centres of power. The media, rule of law, the opposition, the autonomy of the state administration, have all been affected. What is particularly worrying is that the secret police have acquired the capacity to intervene very extensively in the affairs of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">All this augurs badly for the future, especially if Ukrainians genuinely seek a European future, because the system being built by Yanukovych points away from Europe, not towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">The most that can be said for the changes is that they have brought a degree of stability to the country, but increasingly, this stability foreshadows stasis and immobility. At the same time, it is true, Yanukovych has certainly improved relations with Russia, but has thereby accepted a degree of subordination to Moscow that is new. Whether Ukrainian society will accept this transformation in the longer term is an open question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The language of the draft resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the language used to condemn African dictators and South American regimes. This is not the right kind of language to use for the situation in Ukraine. I would like the members of the PPE to decide whether we should describe Ukraine using the language of Commissioner Füle, who says ‘yes, but...’, or in other words that some things are good, but there are a lot of things we do not like, or whether we should use negative language, whereby there is nothing we like, and everything is to be condemned.</p>

I understand the PPE’s regret that Yulia Tymoshenko lost the elections, but I say to you: it is unfortunate, maybe she had a chance of winning, but she lost. Now she has lost, let us acknowledge what is really happening and let us keep the Ukrainian authorities under careful observation, but let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All information from the OSCE shows that Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former Soviet Union in which proper elections have, to date, been held. This is an achievement of Ukraine, both on the orange and on the blue side. It is an achievement that we cannot question before the next elections are over. It would be a serious political error on the part of the European Union and our Parliament if we listened to the voice of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and threw doubt on the fact that elections can be held successfully in one of very few countries in the East. Let us help Ukraine conduct normal elections. Let us not make any judgments before they have been held.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the Ukrainian guests present in this House today: Ukraine’s place is here, in this Chamber, and that is why we are subjecting you to the same standards that we apply to the countries of the European Union. That is what you fought for together, whether blue or orange. Every issue, even the tiniest one, to do with human rights or press freedom will be scrutinised here. Do not be surprised – I am talking to our Ukrainians brothers. That is because you are being treated as a European country, according to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">My last appeal to you is to act together in your dealings with the European institutions and Parliament. We believe that in the future, you will be among us. We know that it will not happen soon, but we want to help you with this. I agree with Mrs Harms that the time for resolutions is after the elections. It is then, before the EU summit, that we will be able to discuss the issue frankly and draft a position with which to present the European Parliament’s common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we cannot be indifferent to what happens in that country. On 1 October, tens of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest against the constitutional changes initiated by Yanukovych and confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the composition of which was changed shortly after the election of the President. These reforms were carried out without democratic debate and without the agreement of the Venice Commission. The changes weaken the balance of power and threaten the independence of the judiciary in Ukraine. Economic reforms are also put under threat. Our Ukrainian friends have expressed concern over the organisation of the coming elections, over the excessive representation of the ruling coalition in the Central Electoral Commission, the restrictions on non-governmental organisations and state interference in the activities of opposition parties. This is precisely why this resolution is needed today. Unfortunately, the ruling coalition rejected the opposition motion in the Ukrainian parliament to make membership of the European Union a priority of Ukraine’s foreign policy. We must, however, continue to stress the importance of cooperation with Ukraine and monitor the implementation of agreements that have been concluded. The European Union must demand that corruption be fought and, at the same time, help in that fight, and that press freedom be ensured. A situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the High Judicial Council, which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges, is not characteristic of a democratic state. In conclusion, we also need to take positive steps, providing not only for the introduction of a visa-free regime in the future, but also economic cooperation, especially in the energy sphere, while, at the same time, we await the democratic development of Ukraine. That would be the objective of the next resolution, which we should draw up after the election, and should cover energy, the economy and other issues of significance for Ukraine. Thank you.</p>

We had political, economic and financial instability – even a deep crisis – but now we have a very different picture.

<p class="contents">There are problems. We do not deny that. But we must admit that they are listening to our voice; some corrective measures have been taken, for example, on the issues of electoral law and some electoral practices. In this sense, our voice will be heard there as long as we do not cry out on each occasion, but adopt a decent approach to Ukraine.</p>

Such a move has never happened before. It is a clear attempt to influence the elections. We should not allow our parliament to be part of this game.</p>

It is interesting that whenever certain political forces feel that their allies in a country outside the European Union have not won, these forces abroad instantly express their concerns about the state of democracy in that country. I agree with what Mr Kamiński and others have said. We definitely need action from the European Parliament to contribute to the development of democracy and the improvement of conditions for the mutual development of relationships. Efforts to support stabilising actions by the Ukrainian Government apparently stepped on the toes of some of those who revel in chaos and lawlessness.

Unless we want to lose Ukraine as our future member, let us be patient and concentrate on economic cooperation; let us build up a climate of mutual trust.

This is a good thing, as there have certainly been a few serious problems in recent years and the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, in particular, had a serious effect on the gas supplies of EU Member States. Subsequently, it was, of course, clear that Russia stopped the gas supplies during the price discussions and my home country of Austria, alone, experienced a fall of 33% in supplies of Russian gas, while France, Hungary and Italy also recorded drops of 20 to 40%. This calls for the Commission – as coordinator of the Energy Community – to grab Ukraine by the arm and remind it of its obligations when it comes to Europe’s security of supply. The energy supply of our Member States cannot simply be allowed to become a pawn in the price war between Russia and Ukraine.

<p class="contents">Yanukovych won the election to become President democratically, albeit by a small margin. There are indeed some worrying authoritarian trends in Kiev, from attempts to re-establish the temniki censorship of press freedom to the use of the FBU security service, led by an oligarch for political purposes. However, the West is watching the process closely. President Yanukovych is now under pressure. The legacy of the Orange Revolution is still strong and the Ukrainian civil society that emerged from it very robust.</p>

We decided that we would issue a resolution after the elections, and that is what we did. We called upon the government and the opposition to observe human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">Several months have gone by since that resolution, and we can already see that some of its provisions have not been observed.

<p class="contents">First, let me respond to a concrete question by Mr Belder concerning the investment and business environment. More needs to be done in Ukraine in this field. That is obvious, and I have raised this question a number of times, whether in the framework of the Association Council or in the framework of various meetings. The last time I had the opportunity to raise this issue was with Prime Minister Azarov, just last week. There are a number of issues, such as the procurement law and the possibility of going back on this law through various amendments which are now being debated in the Ukrainian Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">More needs to be done as far as the rule of law is concerned and, of course, we have watched with great interest the Mittal case in recent days. More needs to be done to deliver on the commitment and promises made to deal with the VAT issue, which is also an irritant for our businesses. Through our contacts with the Ukrainian authorities, and through regular contacts with businessmen, we are set to protect the interests of European investors and European businessmen.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that it is not an easy process in which we are engaged with Ukraine. This is a process where proclamations about the European future might sometimes be helpful, but will not deliver. What is going to deliver is building more of the European Union within Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">They need our assistance. They also need us to give them a reality check from time to time. That is what they expect from us.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not need is to be pushed into a false debate about what is more important: stability or adherence and commitment to values, and that leads me to my third point.</p>
<p class="contents">Who am I to comment on the draft resolution before this House, but I think the very fact that this debate has happened has already given a valuable signal. I think the fact that this House’s representatives are going to Ukraine soon, and will pass on most of these messages, conveys a very valuable message in itself. I think that another very valuable message in terms of what we should expect from the Ukrainians is that the forthcoming local elections on 31 October will reconfirm the democratic stance of their country.</p>

<p class="contents">You spoke about the rule of law in general.

Its size, location and the vicissitudes of history make it an important bridge between East and West. It is hardly surprising that now as before, Europe is closely following political events within Ukraine. However, the current picture is not without ambiguity. We must recognise that the new government was elected in free and democratic elections and it helped pull Ukraine out of the economic and political chaos that dominated six months ago. On the other hand, we cannot ignore tendencies in the area of media freedom that cause concern. However, I agree with colleagues who stated that today’s resolution is ill-timed. I think we must postpone it, and following the visit by a European Parliament delegation scheduled for next week, following the coming council elections and the EU-Ukraine High-Level Meeting, we would be able to give a more balanced and objective parliamentary position. After all, Ukraine may provide a good example to other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States of how to go down the route of rapprochement with the EU while, at the same time, fostering good relations with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not think there is any particular reason for this. It is just that the Member States ratify in accordance with a process that can sometimes differ from one Member State to the other.

It is true that neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases, of which epilepsy is one, are a major concern for many of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the field of public health and disease prevention. A horizontal approach is therefore taken at EU level, with the focus being on combating stigmatisation of and discrimination against people affected by neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the Council invited the Member States, in its June 2003 conclusions on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental health, to give specific attention to the impact of stigma and discrimination related problems due to mental illness in all age groups, and to ensure that these problems are recognised, in this context, giving special attention to the reduction of risks of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions of 3 June 2005 on Community action in the field of mental health, the Council invited the Member States to implement the declaration and action plan adopted by the European Ministerial Conference of the World Health Organisation on mental health, held in Helsinki in January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council is particularly committed to combating another illness that is part of the group of neurodegenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-psychiatric brain diseases, namely Alzheimer’s disease. I should mention in this connection the conclusions of 16 December 2008 on public health strategies to combat neurodegenerative diseases associated with ageing and, in particular, Alzheimer’s disease, and the conclusions of 3 December 2009 on joint programming of research in Europe, covering, in particular, the launch of the pilot joint programming initiative dedicated to the fight against neurodegenerative diseases and Alzheimer’s disease in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the basis of this text, the October European Council, which will take place next week on 18 and 19 October, will establish the European Union’s position in view of the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. This EU position encompasses all the important aspects of this conference: the expected outcome, the conditions for the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012, the progress to be made in the various areas outlined in the Bali road map – mitigation, adaptation, forest technology aspects and financing.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these aspects, the Council has strived to present a position which is clear and easy to communicate. It is now incumbent on all European Union players to use this position to send a clear and unequivocal message to our international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council has just pointed out, the European Union hopes that the Cancún meeting will result in the adoption of a balanced series of decisions that will aid the introduction of an international policy to protect the climate after 2012. Moreover, there will be several bilateral meetings and contacts before Cancún, and they will provide an opportunity for us to explain our position to our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conference itself, this position will be clarified if necessary during the regular coordination meetings held by the European Union. Of course, we are counting on all the institutions to help make our position clear by conveying, if possible, the same message in all our external representations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This scheme is very clearly aimed at countries that cannot afford this reduction.</p>

<p class="contents">In so doing, it is following up on the conclusions of the March 2010 European Council, which highlighted the need to reduce the early school-leaving rate in Europe and which also set a collective target for bringing it under 10% by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has launched several initiatives to this end, starting with the ministerial-level seminar that it organised at the very start of its term, in July. This seminar, together with the meeting of Directors-General of compulsory education, which incidentally took place the day before, focused on the difficulties pupils experience in acquiring basic skills, that is to say, their mother tongue, sciences and mathematics, as well as on the experience of Member States and the policy guidelines to be developed as regards the prevention of early school leaving.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from these meetings, the Presidency has drawn up conclusions on the importance of raising the level of key skills in the context of European cooperation in the area of school education. Since the Council is currently discussing these conclusions, the Presidency is planning to put them on the November Council agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Council is waiting for a proposal for a recommendation that the Commission is due to submit shortly on the issue of early school leaving at European level. At the same time, efforts will continue or will be stepped up at national level in order to gradually reduce the early school-leaving rate by 2020, in accordance with the target set by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would add that in the context of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, the Belgian Presidency also organised, on 28 September, the conference entitled ‘Breaking the cycle of disadvantage – Social inclusion in and through education’. The outcome of this conference will serve as material for a debate that will take place during the Education Council on 19 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear to me that a number of our children, depending on their family status, their parents’ financial status, are disadvantaged in their schooling and that the economic crisis has obviously made this phenomenon much worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, both the Council and the Commission have taken this on board since, together, we have adopted, as you know, this 2020 strategy, which combines at the same time economic development, research for development, the quality of our teaching and also the fight against poverty. All these elements form a whole that enables us, in my view at least, to come up with a coherent response.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to return briefly to key skills, because this is an important issue. The conclusions that the Belgian Presidency will submit for adoption at the November Council will target a number of objectives. I will mention them quickly: the implementation of national strategies for improving pupils’ performance in reading, mathematics and science.</p>
<p class="contents">Another objective is to analyse the effectiveness of current national strategies in order to have a source of information that can be used, as we were saying previously, in the decision-making process. However, the aim is also to launch pilot projects carried out between Member States on a voluntary basis and with the aim of improving young Europeans’ basic skills, and – why not? – to ensure the more effective use of the instruments that we have available to us and which are relevant, such as those that are part of the open method of coordination, the programme for education and lifelong learning and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are a number of objectives that we will pursue under the Belgian Presidency and that will most certainly be taken up by subsequent presidencies, in particular, by the Hungarian Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Back in May 1995, the European Union adopted, by means of Council Decision 95/170/CFSP, its very first joint action to help combat the use and proliferation of anti-personnel landmines throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was therefore the first to act within the international community, in November 1997, following the adoption of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. On 18 September, the Council adopted a new joint action designed to continue the Union’s political efforts with regard to the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines and, more specifically, to establish a joint moratorium on the export and production of anti-personnel mines and to facilitate a multi-dimensional contribution, within the Union, to mine clearance efforts and other related activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the European Union has continually promoted these commitments, which have been based, since 2003, on the European security strategy. In June 2008, a new joint action was adopted to support the universal adoption of the Ottawa Convention. This joint action is also aimed at specifically helping the States Parties to the Convention to implement the convention’s provisions, particularly those concerning mine clearance, victim assistance and the destruction of stockpiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the number of States Parties to the Convention has considerably increased, and the number of victims of anti-personnel landmines is going down, there is still a need to assist victims and to improve their lives in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was involved in drawing up the 2010-2014 action plan – which it fully supports – adopted in Cartagena, Colombia, during the convention’s second review conference from 29 November to 4 December 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Council decision is currently being drafted in order to specifically support the action plan and its victim assistance component. In addition to the Council’s more political action, the assistance programmes managed by the Commission in the context of development aid and of the Neighbourhood Policy – together with the Member States’ national programmes – have increased the European Union’s contribution to mine clearance and victim assistance to EUR 1.8 billion, which is half of the total global contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me remind you of the resolution that you adopted last year, when we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the United Nations resolution establishing 25 November as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. In that resolution, you invited the Commission to submit a targeted and more coherent EU policy plan, and urged Member States to introduce a coherent system for collecting statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member has reminded us, in March, the Council asked the Commission to draw up a European strategy for preventing and combating violence against women. One of the priorities identified by the Council in this matter is to prepare the creation of a European observatory on violence against women, based on existing structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently drafting a new strategy on violence against women, which will also touch on the creation of this observatory. However, as you can imagine, for the time being, we still do not know what will be in the strategy. We expect to receive it some time next year. It is therefore highly likely that a separate proposal will be required thereafter in order to create this observatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, as you know, the Council can only intervene as legislator on the basis of a Commission proposal. Such a proposal will be duly examined by the Council, acting as colegislator with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, it is a little premature at this stage to make assumptions about what the objectives of a future observatory on violence against women will be, and especially about the date when it will come into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still hope then, that at some point, there will be a centre which will collect reliable data about the violence against women that continues to exist. However, I would like to know whether, in your opinion, the Member States hold sufficient data for the fight against violence towards women to really become a priority.

<p class="contents">In its conclusions, the Council encourages the Commission to continue its impact assessment with a view to preparing, if appropriate, an EU legislative proposal on biodegradable waste by 2010. You will tell me that we are in 2010 now. In particular, the Council invited the Commission to consider preventive measures, measures for introducing separate collection of biodegradable waste, a quality assurance system based on the principle of integrated chain management and traceability throughout the process, and the establishment of requirements on labelling and on quality criteria for compost and digestate.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council of 11 June 2010 took note of the Commission communication on future steps in bio-waste management in the European Union. In that communication, the Commission indicated its intention to continue working towards the introduction of technical rules to assist bio-waste management and, accordingly, to amend Directive 86/278/EEC on sewage sludge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is obviously going to examine a new proposal along these lines, and the Belgian Presidency organised a conference on bio-waste on 21 September to discuss, among other things, the substance of the Commission communication. The outcome of this conference was communicated to the Council on 14 October, so it is very recent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main objective of this exercise is to align the timetable for presenting the stability and growth programmes and the national reform programmes, with a view to ensuring consistent structural surveillance at every level of budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth, whilst preserving formally separated individual procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">This process will allow for better coordination of economic policies within the European Union and will help to strengthen budgetary discipline, macro-economic stability and growth. This same concern has led the European Union, in accordance with the powers laid down in the treaty, to envisage measures aimed at promoting the recovery while also ensuring this budgetary discipline. Europe 2020, the new EU strategy for employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, adopted by the European Council on 17 June, meets this challenge. Its aim is to change the focus of policies from crisis management to the introduction of medium- and long-term reforms, which specifically promote growth and employment, and which also guarantee the viability of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the major objectives identified in the Europe 2020 strategy include an increase in the number of jobs, better conditions for research and development, an improvement in education levels – we touched on this in a previous question – and the promotion of social inclusion, including poverty reduction. To my mind, therefore, there is no mismatch between a stability pact and measures to restore growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand, and we are obviously all sensitive to the Irish problem. My answer to your first question is obviously a very broad one covering 27 Member States, because we must have consistent policies, we must have monetary and budgetary stability policies, and recovery policies. Furthermore, it is fair to say that some will, of course, have more difficulties than others, depending on their level of debt, depending on their annual debt in the last two or three years and since the beginning of the recession.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes, it is true that Ireland is going through a difficult time. You can rest assured that Europe understands that it is going through this difficult time, but I think that several countries are in this situation, several countries will experience the same thing in the future, and austerity and solidarity are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the economic governance measures that the Commission has put on the table this week will invariably include a concern not to leave any country by the wayside – you know what Europe was capable of in terms of solidarity in the case of Greece. Let us not compare the situation of two countries, but rest assured that under no circumstances will Europe leave any of the 27 Member States by the wayside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regarding the first question: of course, there have been, and still are, a number of disparities in the accounting standards. These standards are, of course, being harmonised, because if, in the future, we want to be fair to all 27 Member States’ economies, we need to have the same calculation methods. Therefore, this harmonisation is ongoing and under way.</p>
<p class="contents">As for flexibility regarding the 3% limit, as you know, we really are being flexible; we have been flexible since 2009, we have been flexible in 2010, and we will continue to be flexible in 2011 and 2012 so that our various Member States can return to healthy budgets, because if we wanted to apply this 3% limit rigidly, with absolutely no margin for error, then this year for instance, practically every one of us would have failed to comply with this budgetary restraint plan, and that is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European institutions realised that returning to stable and balanced budgets by 2013 would take time, particularly in view of the recession and the Member States’ situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the North-South imbalance. Whether the imbalance is between the North and the South or between Member States which have capitalised to some degree on aid provided by the European Union in order to boost their economy, productive fabric and labour market, and other Member States which have done so to a lesser extent, I think that the European Union is actually there to safeguard this coherence, this cohesion. In particular, the funds available in the European budget for cohesion – the first heading in the Union’s budget – should indeed be used to reduce these imbalances. You mention the North-South imbalance, but I am not sure that that is the only imbalance that exists within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Council measures in favour of free movement of labour between Member States</span></p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s new plan for the economy for the next ten years refers to workforce mobility as an essential condition for reducing unemployment. The unemployment rate has risen disturbingly with the crisis, from 6.8% in May 2008 to 10% in July 2010. Meanwhile, according to a Commission survey published on 13 July 2010, 48% of Europeans would be willing to seek employment outside their country or region, rather than remain jobless. In addition, 17% said they expected to work abroad at some time in the future. It should also be remembered that Member States are obliged to give preference to nationals of other Member States over third-country workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the above, can the Council state what concrete measures it proposes with a view to the rapid elimination of the barriers now existing to the free movement of workers from those Member States which joined the Union after 1 May 2004? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the temporary restrictions set out in the accession treaties, it is up to each Member State still applying restrictions to assess the repercussions for its labour market and to decide whether to maintain the remaining restrictions or to relax them before the end of the transition period: April 2011 for the countries that joined in 2004 and December 2013 for the countries that joined in 2007. Moreover, the Council has invited those Member States that are still applying restrictions in accordance with the transitional provisions laid down in the accession treaties to lift them during the third phase of the transition period if it cannot be established that their labour market would suffer or is liable to suffer serious disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Since May 2009, when Denmark granted free access to its labour market, the transitional provisions applied by Member States have stayed the same, and whereas a majority of Member States do grant free access to workers from those Member States that joined after 1 May 2004, 10 Member States are still applying restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has stressed that the economic and financial crisis should not be used as a reason to justify, on its own or more generally, the continued use of the provisions in question, and has called on Member States to further develop suitable strategies and tools which would enable them to identify and analyse the barriers to the geographical and professional mobility of workers, and to help eliminate existing barriers, in accordance with the treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that everything is being done to inform Member States that retain a number of restrictions to thoroughly analyse this transitional phase, during which they retain a number of restrictions, and to see how they can lift those restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, to answer one of the questions, I should add that, while it is true that the free movement of workers is a priority for the Council, it is a priority in particular for the Presidency. You will find in the 18-month programme of work of the trio of Presidencies of the Council – Spain, Belgium and Hungary – that these three countries will work, and are currently working, on the review of the single market that is under way, by encouraging the implementation of the four freedoms, given that exploiting the full potential of the single market is essential for a return to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our programme specifically mentions the possibility of reviewing the transition periods, which limit the free movement of workers from the new Member States. Should we consider that these transitional restrictions are incompatible with the free movement of workers? It is not for me to judge, as the transitional restrictions are defined in the accession treaties and such restrictions have been used for all the accessions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, beyond the incentives we can offer them, it is the responsibility of each Member State applying these restrictions to analyse the impact on its own labour market and to decide whether to retain or lift these restrictions before the end of these transitional periods, which, as you will recall, are April 2011 for the 2004 accessions, and December 2013 for the 2007 accessions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in Pakistan’s history. The cost in humanitarian needs, and to its already fragile economy, is immense. The severity of this crisis demands an immediate and substantial response, also taking into account the strategic importance of Pakistan’s development, security and stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council on 16 September called for a comprehensive package of short-, medium- and longer-term measures that will help underpin Pakistan’s recovery and future development. The initial EU response to the floods was swift and generous. Our common contribution to the humanitarian aid efforts presently stands at more than EUR 320 million from Member States and the European Commission in cash and in kind. This alone represents more than 60% of the global initial UN appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council recognised that, in addition to the immediate and significant humanitarian aid and development assistance, ambitious trade measures are essential for economic recovery and growth. Trade is therefore part of the long-term response to the ongoing crisis. To this end, the Commission adopted on 7 October a proposal for unilateral suspension of import duties on a number of important export items from Pakistan. This proposal is now submitted to Member States and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to liberalise 75 tariff lines on imports from Pakistan, accounting for 27% of Pakistan’s current imports to the EU and almost EUR 900 million. This would yield an increase in EU imports from Pakistan of about EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this measure is to support Pakistan’s reconstruction efforts in the medium term. Consequently, the special concessions will be limited in time – the Commission is proposing three years. Given the nature of Pakistan’s industrial base and export basket, where textiles account for more than 60%, a large number of products for which we propose liberalisation are textile products. Other industrial products such as ethanol are also included.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament and the Council can act quickly on this, we hope to have the measure in place on 1 January 2011. In parallel, we are working with other members of the World Trade Organisation to obtain the necessary permission – a WTO waiver – which has to be granted before the measure takes effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The trade concessions should be economically meaningful for Pakistan but, at the same time, take account of industrial sensitivities in the European Union. Therefore, in drawing up this proposal, we have tried to take into account industrial sensitivities in the EU, especially as regards textiles. Our analysis has shown that the impact on EU production is likely to be modest.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential increase in EU imports from Pakistan (EUR 100 million) corresponds to less than 0.5% of EU production value of the liberalised items, which, in fact, account for EUR 24 billion. The European Parliament’s support in helping this proposal come to fruition is essential to the presentation of a complete picture of EU solidarity in times of unprecedented needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade can be an important part of a long-term economic solution for Pakistan. We have a tight calendar to work to. You can count on me and my staff to explain our approach and reduce any lingering concerns you may have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For example, the textiles and clothing industry represents 11% of Portugal’s total exports, 22% of the manufacturing industry; 80% of production for some products even takes place in Portugal. Perhaps, then, this 80% spread across the 27 Member States means little to the European Commission, but it means an enormous amount to Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot demand extremely damaging – but understandable – measures to control public audits and to fight the deficit, and, at the same time, take decisions that hurt the productive heartlands and capacities for wealth and job creation of those very same countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say too that this decision is also an incomprehensible attack on the normal market rules. I do not advocate any form of market protectionism, but I demand the strict defence of its proper rules: the rules of a market that is healthy and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">Please understand that this decision will make it possible for products manufactured in Pakistan to come on to the European market, and with production costs below those possible for our companies simply because the same conditions are not required of them during production; humble apologies, but I call that unfair competition. It is unfair competition because Pakistani companies do not have social costs relating to their workers, they do not have environmental costs, they are not particularly concerned with combating the child labour that goes on there, and they do not have equivalent restrictions on the use of primary materials for reasons of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">I would even ask: how is such a radical decision possible without a report being tabled first that exactly details its negative impact on the various Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I could venture some consequences right now, and those consequences are the closure and collapse of companies in the European Union, particularly in Portugal, and increased numbers of unemployed. It is good for you to fully understand this, because there will come a time when someone has to be responsible for it.</p>
<p class="contents">If, in the end, we can assume – as some surely will – that this proposal is inevitable, please at least give a bit of forethought to some things that are not yet under consideration. For example, the establishment of a tariff rate quota, which is provided for in the case of ethanol, but not in that of textiles. The waiver should be for a maximum of one year because aid is temporary. Believe me; no European company will survive three years in direct competition with Pakistani companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I am finishing now: lastly, a provision is needed on primary materials, so that Pakistan does not block European companies’ access to such materials to benefit from this production itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the Commission’s proposal to suspend import duties on key Pakistan imports into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the common ground between us is that Pakistan, which has not had an easy history since its birth as a nation, is going through its worst possible period. It is in the frontline of the war against terrorism, costing it so far, it is reckoned, USD 40 billion. We are all very well aware of the floods, the combined impact of which is worse than the Asian tsunami of 2004 and the Haitian floods of earlier this year. That is a significant blow to any country.</p>
<p class="contents">What I welcome about the Commission proposal is that we give Pakistan the opportunity to trade its way out of some of its difficulties. It is an intelligent proposal. Firstly, as the Commissioner has said, the 75 tariff lines that would help boost Pakistan’s trade by an estimated EUR 100 million a year do little harm to EU investment. This will not significantly damage any European Union industry and, equally importantly – in fact, quite possibly even more importantly – it will not harm the developing countries which are on a par with Pakistan, because none of the tariff lines affect products on the DDA preference erosion list. That is very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that is sensible about the Commission proposal is that it is time-limited and does not unilaterally attempt to alter the GSP resolution. I welcome that because it still gives an incentive to Pakistan to come into line with social and human rights standards between now and 2014 in order to qualify for GSP+ in 2014. So it gives the emergency aid we need now but, at the same time, does not give <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to the Pakistan Government. It says ‘you have a duty yourself to put your country in order if you want to continue to qualify for these benefits’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real test of Europe’s generosity and I hope that we, in this Parliament, will be prepared to meet it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees. On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy. With the European Commission’s proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector. We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost. However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission – above all – not to make the mistake of naivety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves. Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters. By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should bear in mind that almost 14 million people suffered from the flooding in Pakistan, which was of truly biblical dimensions. It caused unimaginable destruction in Pakistan itself, and the results will soon be felt all over the world. Why? Cotton, which is also referred to as white gold, and of which Pakistan is one of the main producers, grew poorly this year, and on top of that, has been largely destroyed in the country. Clothes manufacturers and leading global brands are already forecasting an increase in the price of cotton products. Cotton is a raw material we come across all the time, and which is used to manufacture clothes, banknotes, coffee filters, tents and fishing nets, as well as even being found in book bindings and many other everyday products. It is used for a huge number of purposes. We are in a time of crisis, and increases in the price of daily necessities are forecast. This makes the scale of the problem huge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whole regions have been flooded, regions that are bigger than many of our Member States. Tens, in fact hundreds, of thousands of people are in major need. The infrastructure has been destroyed: roads, hospitals, universities, nurseries, schools, businesses. Many people’s livelihoods have been destroyed. I do not think we can even imagine what that is like. We all agree that we have to help. The problem, though, as we would say in German, is ‘wash me, but do not get me wet’. What do I mean by that? Well, direct financial aid costs money, which, of course, has to be taken from elsewhere in our budget. Indirect aid – trade facilitation – is what the Commission is now proposing, and there, too, there are, of course, concerns from those who may be affected. That is why we are quite rightly having this debate on this topic today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not proposed using the Generalised System of Preferences. That is a good thing, I feel. Fundamentally, I think the current solution of doing this via the WTO, taking this route and really trying to help people help themselves, is a prudent one. There are many unanswered questions, however, such as what will the impact on industries in the European Union really be? When I look at the Commission’s document, the proposal for a regulation, I see that it states in the explanatory memorandum right at the beginning that the working premise is that net imports into the EU would rise by EUR 100 million per year. Is that really major, durable aid to Pakistan? Will it really help to move the major sums that we are actually talking about here? On the other hand, the proposal will entail tariff revenue losses of EUR 80 million from our budget. Does this ratio add up, too? Does it make sense to do without EUR 80 million in customs revenue in order to receive EUR 100 million in increased imports? Are these figures correct? I would like some really head-on information from the Commission on this whole issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that we have to help Pakistan. I am also prepared to explain to the citizens of the European Union, and to those of my electoral district, that we have to do something and that aid for others always has to be paid for by someone. However, I am firmly convinced, Commissioner, that you should use the opportunity this evening and over the coming days and weeks to really convince the 736 Members of the European Parliament that your measures are the right ones to take, that they are sensible. You should also use the opportunity, above all, to highlight ways in which the workers of companies that may be affected in countries like Portugal, Italy and Spain, and in the European Union as a whole, can also find routes forward and prospects for themselves. I believe that these are truly the tasks to be performed in order to achieve a majority for your proposal in this House in a few weeks’ or months’ time. I believe there is a lot of work to be done by all those involved in connection with convincing people and providing information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With a crisis that is hitting work, employment and growth, I wonder about the logic inspiring some European countries but, above all, the European Commission, in terms of international relations. The Commission proposal under discussion today will heavily penalise some industrial sectors, particularly textiles and, in a situation like the present one, we must ask ourselves whether it is reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people fear that these decisions are borne from the desire for Europe to take a leading role on the world stage. In reality, we know that this is not so and that the attempt to reduce the pressure, including terrorist pressure, within or related to some political and institutional systems, has even less to do with it. The truth is that not even the recent flood has anything to do with this proposal, since the main concentration of the Pakistani textiles industry is not based in the regions hit by the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual reason is that once more, the aim is to penalise a sector in favour of financing the European economy and to favour large-scale retail, rather than the interests of the manufacturing industry located in some European countries. This is profoundly mistaken in terms of growth, work and employment in a time of serious economic crisis and the need for real EU growth on global markets, in terms of its exports and its capacity for innovation and quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the floods which took place, I actually have travelled to Pakistan to see for myself the extent of the devastation. The devastation caused by the floods is the biggest natural disaster in Pakistan’s history. It is certainly beyond anything that I could have imagined or expected to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, when I met with the Prime Minister of Pakistan on 22 September, he was very appreciative of the EU’s response to date and he believed it to be a very courageous response; courageous in the way that Commissioner De Gucht has described it. We have to be absolutely sure that we continue to react in an appropriate way. The Commission has now come forward with a legislative proposal to cut the tariff to zero on 75 tariff lines covering 27% of Pakistan’s exports to the EU, which would boost Pakistan’s exports by about EUR 100 million a year. This really is now a test of the EU’s credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that we translate the political agreement reached by EU leaders into action that will make a real difference and give the Pakistani economy a lifeline at this desperate time of need. We are, after all, their largest trading partner. I hear the concerns made by colleagues in this Chamber and it is only right that we are fair in our response; fair but ambitious. The trade concession to be offered to Pakistan needs to represent a credible effort by the EU and bring about meaningful economic benefits to Pakistan, whilst taking into account sensitivities of our own industries as well as other WTO members – in particular, those of least-developed countries.</p>

<p class="contents">Critical to food production at affordable prices are the millions of small farmers and landless farmers now at the mercy of the landlord class. The distribution of free seeds, fertilisers that are environmentally compatible and other utilities could lay the basis for a rapid recovery of food supplies, but the liquidation of landlordism in Pakistan and the distribution of land to the landless is a key to food sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">It was 140 years ago that the Irish peasantry conducted a major struggle for an end to landlordism, so it is long overdue here. Tariff reductions must go to the workers and the poor and not to the landlords, corrupt state officials or the profits of industrialists.

<p class="contents">The regulation proposed by the Commission concentrates, above all, on the suspension of duties in the textile and leather goods sectors – which represent 60% of Pakistani exports with a turnover of almost EUR 200 million for textiles and EUR 510 million for the leather industry, both of which are characterised by production located in neighbouring areas that are not clearly affected by the floods.</p>
<p class="contents">It seemed to us that the political indications were instead directed at choosing an aid policy that did not damage structural sectors for the European economy. The suspension of duties will have a serious effect on European textiles and leather industries, with a potential loss of thousands of jobs over the planned three years of the regulation. These measures will be integrated and aggravated by the Generalised System of Preferences which, in 2013, will be extended to Pakistan as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are all aware that exceptional and unilateral measures are being adopted because we want to help a large, poor country that is in trouble due to the disaster that has hit it and is further aggravated by the economic crisis and the failure to adjust the World Trade Organisation’s rules. Indeed, the current rules favour countries that are already developed, such as China and India, rather than poorer countries. Exceptional measures in favour of one country should not, however, cause a crisis in other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal therefore requires significant corrections to diversify the sectors involved, including the production and exports of Pakistan, accepting a different vision and a serious reflection on the respect for human rights and the fight against terrorism. Pakistan must be helped, but through clear agreements, including those with regard to the political situation in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Spain represents 16% of the volume of business from the textiles sector. The Community of Valencia represents 18% of Spanish textile production, and 17% of employment is in the Community of Valencia. The market for the Valencian textile sector is Europe and, within Europe, France, Italy and Germany.

I will say, probably for the first time in this Chamber, that I am impressed by both the Commission’s and the Council’s swift action and resolve on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly the case that money is needed. However, what is the point of providing support and money – other than to assuage our own bad conscience – if, at the same time, we make it more difficult, by means of duties and barriers to trade, for people to recover by their own efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing right now, namely comprehensively and quickly abolishing duties and barriers to trade on all 75 different tariff lines, corresponding to 27% of Pakistan’s exports, is an excellent response to the disaster that this country is facing. However, we in Parliament now have a responsibility. We have a responsibility to act swiftly. In other words, this must not turn into an example of how long the political process can take. Pakistan needs money and aid now – not in a year’s time. We must demonstrate that we understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am disheartened to see how wide the opposition to this is. I received a petition from European textile producers expressing their opposition to this, as they were afraid that Pakistan would export more to Europe, which they did not want.</p>
<p class="contents">However, is that not the whole point of it? Is it not the intention that they should be able to trade with us in order to get themselves out of poverty? If European consumers were to get slightly cheaper textiles, would that be a problem?</p>
<p class="contents">Free trade and solidarity are often embraced here right up until we are to make a decision on them. Let us here and now demonstrate that these values are most important to us when they are needed the most. There is probably no better opportunity to stand up for both free trade and solidarity than in connection with this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My concerns regard the negative consequences on European industry and particularly Italian industry – and on the loss of jobs in Europe in a sector that has already been sorely tested by the economic crisis. I am referring in particular to the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector that we are trying to help anyway, and which would suffer considerable damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the fact that Pakistan set a 15% duty on its cotton fibre exports at the start of this year in order to discourage the supply of raw materials is not insignificant. It is clear that the aim is to conserve raw materials by seeking to obtain more attractive exchange rates for their export. I fully understand the need to help a country with serious problems, particularly following the serious disasters it has suffered. However, the European aid that I would hope for would be contributions towards the construction of roads and infrastructure using local labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is right for the European Union to act quickly and provide help quickly here. The big question that arises for me, when it comes to the measures that you have proposed is, are we giving help in the right place or are we helping the wrong people?

<p class="contents">What Pakistan is trying to do at this point is actually to help itself out of the mess that it is in after the devastating floods. If the factories were in flood-hit areas, they would not be able to produce, so it is not surprising that the factories concerned are not in flood-hit areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The direct aid that could be put in is miniscule compared to what the need actually is. Distribution of the income from the additional exports is important – we know that for infrastructure, for energy supplies, for schools, for roads, etc. – while there are indeed responsibilities that lie with the democratically elected government of Pakistan in terms of its effectiveness, of income, of tax revenue and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">People have also talked about the need for greater diversity. If Pakistan had a greater diversity of industrial sectors, we would not be concentrating so much on textiles. I appeal to Members to offer that country this opportunity to help itself out of this disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective types of aid that are aimed at the recovery of the affected areas and the improvement of the living conditions of local people, but also fairer types of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade concessions are not long-term measures, as I have been saying. This benefits the large European importers above all, as it fulfils their long-held pretensions. However, it damages the textile industry, as well as the countries and regions that are most dependent on it; all this in a context of profound crisis and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that the measures proposed by the Commission cannot, under any circumstances, be a pretext for more redundancies, we cannot ignore the objective difficulties that these measures are creating. Measures are needed to defend the European textiles sector and the jobs related to it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the suggestion of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, the Union budget 2010 provides for a budget heading allocated to creating a Union programme for the textiles and footwear sector.

<p class="contents">Pakistan must be helped, but we cannot adopt soft trading measures when my country – Italy – and other Member States are already feeling the effects of counterfeiting of textile products, especially from Asian countries and from China in particular. The Commission cannot give to charity at the expense, above all, of Italy, which represents 30% of the entire European textile sector. I believe that along with Pakistan, our small and medium-sized enterprises must be helped to escape from the crisis by imposing duties and quotas on Asian products.

However, the question we must ask ourselves today is what kind of help this country needs most, and what kind is the European Union best capable of providing. We must act quickly, but also effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it is the effectiveness of the European Commission’s proposal which causes me great concern. I find it to be a patchy proposal which, by intervening primarily in the textile and leather sectors, would risk not being effective enough, since this aid could generate fresh tensions due to the new instances of poverty it would generate in Europe and would further hamstring the European textile sector, which is already in serious decline.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we must consider the fact that by favouring exports from producer businesses, we are actually helping those areas of Pakistan which have not been flooded, whereas our aid should serve to build competitiveness and development, helping the recovery of production in the areas of the country that have been hit by the catastrophe. For all these reasons, I believe that the path of abolishing duties is absolutely unsuitable and we do not consent to it or support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, first of all, I would like to present very clearly the figures we are speaking about. We are talking about a trade volume of EUR 900 million. The effect will be EUR 100 million of additional exports to the European market by Pakistan, but the overall balance for the European Union will only be EUR 50 million because, as a result of the more favourable position of Pakistan to export on the European market, there will also be a certain amount of trade diversion, which means that other importers will lose some opportunities on the European markets. So, the overall impact will be about EUR 50 million on a yearly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am saying this because I heard again in this debate that 120 000 jobs would be lost. Now you all have a calculator tool on your mobile phone; if Europe is to lose 120 000 jobs because of an additional EUR 50 million of imports on the European market, then there is really a serious problem with the European textile industry, regardless of what happens with Pakistan. It is simply not serious to put that argument forward.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my first remark. Secondly, we have duly taken into account the sensitivities of the European textile industry and the somewhat difficult position this industry might be in. Bed linen is not part of the tariff lines that we are proposing, and neither are apparel or household linen, which are three of the most sensitive product lines for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, a lot of semi-finished products are included. If they are semi-finished, it means that they will be finished in Europe, which should, in fact, generate cheaper imports for those companies which give the final treatment to such products. So this is not immediately harming us. I would even say the opposite. We have really been studying very carefully what would be a good proposal for Pakistan without harming European industry too much at a time when we are also coming out of an economic crisis that is certainly not easy to manage.</p>
<p class="contents">A comment was also raised concerning cotton exports. There is a scarcity on the worldwide cotton market, and it is true that Pakistan is one of the main cotton producers. What I have in mind is that once we have this agreement, once we see that we are really getting somewhere, we should also ask Pakistan to make sure that our own textile industry gets enough cotton to be able to produce what the market is asking for. As there is such a worldwide scarcity of cotton, or at least certain varieties of cotton, you might ask why we do not import those cotton varieties from Africa. Well, because they do not produce the right varieties of cotton we need, and it is not easy to switch to a different kind of cotton production from one day to another, so we will have to pay special attention to that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just conclude by saying that when you look at the situation with respect to Pakistan, what we need is more aid and more trade; we need both. The European Union has contributed EUR 320 million already, 60% of what the United Nations initially asked for. We will continue to do so; that is more aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade is not aid, as has been said in this plenary. Trade is about giving opportunities to the Pakistani economy to produce and to export and to give jobs to the people that need those jobs. I think it is an essential tool in economic recovery that we should give additional trading opportunities to Pakistan. But it is not about aid, which means that you cannot direct those who will be, let us say, the beneficiaries. It is much easier to direct the process in the case of trade, but we also know that while trade has its frailties we are not going to recover an economy by aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I think you need both elements, aid and trade, and that is why we are working on both possibilities. It is true that we should also bear in mind, as I have been saying in this plenary, that we are talking about a region that has been severely devastated. Many Members of Parliament from Italy have spoken, and I understand that the territory of Pakistan which is flooded is about the size of the territory of the whole of Italy. That is what we are talking about, so I think we should help them, but we should also bear in mind that this is a very sensitive region which is geo-strategically very important. It is also very important to us and to our security. It would be very dangerous for Europe if this region became unstable, so we should do everything we can to make sure that the stability of the region is not affected by what happens in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is an overall array of measures which we are employing. We have political discussions with Pakistan; we had a summit with them recently, and we will continue to have such discussions. Several EU officials have been going there, as well as Commissioner Georgieva, for example, with respect to humanitarian aid. We have the aid package, which is considerable, and we also have an economic approach in terms of more trade. I think, and I hope, that this will really mean something considerable for Pakistan. I am also convinced that by helping Pakistan, we also, to a certain extent, help ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 2005, the European Commission proposed a regulation aimed at putting the European Union on an equal footing with these countries, requiring a certain number of manufactured goods imported into the European Union to include a denomination of origin. This regulation will help offset an imbalance suffered hitherto by European consumers who, compared to citizens of countries outside the EU, do not have the right to choose what they buy in the full knowledge of its provenance. A democratic right, which presupposes freedom of choice and, hence, the right of knowledge, is therefore compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation makes up for a situation of inferiority for EU citizens and also proposes anew the legitimate right to reciprocity. It is a regulation requested by many consumers’ associations and supported by many business associations. Production in Europe will never be able to recover if our producers are not given the same guarantees as other countries in which a regulation on origin marking for products is already in force.</p>
<p class="contents">European producers – who rightly have to comply with many obligations imposed by the European Union in order to guarantee product quality and safeguard consumers and who, in order to export, are obliged to identify their products with a mark of origin – are suffering from unfair competition from producers in third countries who can export their goods to Europe, concealing the provenance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, European small and medium-sized enterprises, in whose favour a resolution was approved during the last legislature on 5 February 2009 addressing the problems encountered in enabling them to internationalise, continue to encounter difficulties because they suffer from unfair competition from those non-EU producers that can export to Europe without an origin mark and European consumers are denied their right to an informed choice.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for the free market to be just that, it must be based on fair competition and be built on clear, shared and applied rules. This is why the approval of this regulation will finally remove this democratic deficit and unfair competition still present in Europe, which damages consumers first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation has been approved by the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade with a large majority of 19 votes in favour and 3 votes against. The European Parliament has already expressed its support during the last legislature with a written declaration voted through with a full majority and, in the current legislature, with a vote on a resolution which obtained 529 votes in favour out of 593 votes cast. It is truly surprising that today, some fellow Members who signed the written declaration and voted in favour of the resolution in November 2009 have moved an amendment intended to reject the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">With great calmness, I feel I can say that those who are against the proposal do not wish to give European citizens the same rights as Chinese citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, for her dedication in support of our proposal and for her hard work. I wish her much success in carrying it further through the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 was long before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and, therefore, long before this House received equal legislative powers regarding trade policy, but the lack of legislative powers did not prevent the European Parliament from twice expressing its support for this proposal. Despite our consistent efforts, there has been no progress towards adoption in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are under the Lisbon Treaty, I am pleased the European Parliament can play its full role in relation to this proposal. I say this because the EU needs to adopt legislation on origin markings for certain goods from third countries. Today, the EU does not require origin marking: products can bear an origin mark provided that this does not mislead the consumer, in line with the EC Directive on unfair business practices of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of our proposal is to introduce a compulsory marking of origin on imports of certain products and to establish clear rules on how origin shall be established. The objectives of our proposal are clear – to enable consumers to know the origin of the goods and to ensure transparency according to a single standard by which origin is determined. Of course, information on origin does not cover everything the consumer may want to know about a specific product, but has the benefit of being useful and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, being better informed, consumers will then be free to decide what to purchase according to their preferences. Incidentally, our proposal can also contribute to reducing the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking. It is limited in scope, applying to goods such as leather, textiles, footwear and glassware, and it would not apply to sectors like electronics, ICT equipment, chemicals, machinery, cars, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the product categories covered, there are products for which information about origin is particularly important: those that are destined for the final consumer. One of the amendments adopted by the Committee on International Trade clearly refers to this condition, which I find positive. Of course, we will need to ensure consistency between this principle – namely ‘goods for final consumers’ – and the actual products that will ultimately be covered by the regulation, as detailed in its annex.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not deny that origin marking has a cost for traders and exporters to the EU. The cost will notably depend on the production processes and technical marking rules. Therefore, it is important to keep these costs to a minimum. The Commission would be in charge of drafting the rules regarding the modalities of the marking, and will pay the utmost attention to minimising costs by relying on international practices, consulting with Member States and all the industries and traders involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting this proposal in a wider context, other large trading partners – like the US, Canada, Japan and China – have long had such schemes in place. We are therefore able to draw useful lessons from the experience of others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I underscore the Commission’s determination to work closely with Parliament in order to have this proposal adopted and to have an efficient, accurate and cost-effective scheme for origin marking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this is a proposal that belongs in the last century, when something that was manufactured in Sweden, for example, also consisted of parts originating only from Sweden. However, in this proposal, it is as if world trade, globalisation and global supply chains have been disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my favourite examples is this shirt that I am wearing. It is made of cotton from Egypt, which was woven into cloth in Italy. It was designed in Hong Kong and finally sewn together in China. I think that a much better description than ‘Made in China’, which it would probably receive under this regulation, would be ‘Made in the world’, to quote Pascal Lamy, former Commissioner and current Director-General of the WTO. That is what the world looks like today.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a proposal that provides better information. I believe that, on the contrary, this is a proposal that creates new barriers to trade and makes trade more difficult, and it is perhaps even protectionist. That is precisely why this type of regulation is prohibited within the EU. On the internal market, it is not permitted, for example, in Sweden to demand that articles imported from Germany be labelled with where they come from. It is true that many of our trading partners, the United States for example, have this type of regulation. The United States introduced such a provision in 1930, but this is not, of course, something we should imitate. We all know that the 1930s were one of the darkest decades in the history of world trade. Instead of introducing trade regulations from the previous century, creating new trade barriers and obstructing world trade, I think that we should do the opposite. In order to get ourselves out of recession, we should facilitate trade. My message to the Commission is therefore: rework the proposal and do it right! I will vote against this proposal tomorrow and I am certain that several of my fellow Members will follow my example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I should like to thank our rapporteur as well as all the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, my friend Mr Susta, for their excellent work and their good cooperation on this text, which will finally enable a system of compulsory marking of origin on certain products imported into Europe to be introduced. I should like to thank you too, Commissioner, for your commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our vote tomorrow will, in fact, be the first stage in the introduction of this regulation, which dates from 2005, and which the European Parliament has always supported and called for. Origin marking is an important step towards transparency and information, which we must constantly improve in favour of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, European consumers rightly want to know what they are purchasing, where the product comes from and under what conditions it was produced. They are therefore demanding to be able to consume in a more informed and, hence, responsible way.</p>
<p class="contents">With this new regulation, we are responding to this demand, because our citizens will be better informed, in particular, of the social and environmental conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced. Contrary to what some people want to believe, the consumer is also a citizen, who agrees to pay more for quality European production, because this legislation is also essential for European companies, whose production is associated with a reputation for quality and high production standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For those companies that have chosen to maintain production safeguarding know-how and employment in Europe, this regulation will re-establish a level playing field with our third-country trading partners. The text resulting from the vote of the Committee on International Trade is balanced, which is why, when it is voted on in tomorrow’s plenary, I call on the Members of this House not to call this balance into question and to support this text by voting overwhelmingly in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Madam President, if you were to visit the <span class="italic">Ponte Rialto</span> in Venice – perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht – and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market. It seeks to protect the consumer – including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice’s <span class="italic">Ponte Rialto</span>, or elsewhere – as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation). Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced. It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and – as far as my group is concerned – it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause. In addition, we also introduced in committee – through an amendment of my own – a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory. We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council. The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together. I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the current globalised world hardly allows one to determine the country of origin; in the end, a guarantee of the quality of this or that product is far more important than its trademark or country of origin. We also need to note that this proposal does not deal with the protection of trademarks or protective labels, and also cannot be of any help in protecting trademarks or protective labels. The fact that it will lead to an increase in the specific cost of a product and, therefore, probably also to an increase in the price of the product, has already been mentioned here by the Commissioner. In the end, the fact that the proposal only relates to certain products – which has been mentioned several times here – could even be described as something like product-based or geographical discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore argue here that we should stick with voluntary labelling, because in the end, where consumers put enough added value on such labelling, the majority of EU producers already use this labelling on a voluntary basis. The European Union is very often criticised for excessive regulation, for passing far too many laws that burden the economic environment. Therefore, I ask, at least in this case, that we do not contribute to the further burdening of the legal and economic environment in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My group welcomes the approach of providing more transparency for consumers in relation to the origin of products, and supports the road map, as Mr Rinaldi described it, to a stage victory. In fact, we would prefer further information to be made apparent, such as information on products’ ecological ‘footprints’, on whether workers’ rights are observed in the manufacturing process or on the equitable sharing of profits by producers and workers. At the same time, we do not believe that this extended wish list belongs in a regulation on the indication of the country of origin, as the name of the country on its own does not provide any reliable information in this regard. Let us take the example of India, where child labour is prohibited. While there are black sheep amongst the companies there, the vast majority do comply with the law. In a European regulation, we therefore have to take into consideration the fact that neither competitors nor nationalists can drag the name of an entire country and its products through the mud.</p>
<p class="contents">We advocate the development of certification systems. Fair trade labels represent a model to follow here, and these should now be further developed with EU support. Additionally taking account of low carbon production methods and humane working conditions would enable us to incorporate modern challenges. I call on the Commission to take steps to initiate an additional regulation in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add one more thought. A consistent introduction of the ‘Made in’ provision also has a part to play in solving complicated political conflicts; for example, the unhindered access of ‘Made in Palestine’ products to the EU market, which would deliver the chance of autonomous economic development in Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This last definition could cause a serious chain reaction because it does not include semi-finished and intermediate products which – having been produced in non-EU countries – with a final and perhaps insignificant final processing upon arrival in Europe, could be passed off as goods made in a Member State. In this way, the consumer would not be fully informed of the real origin of the product whilst big industries would be incentivised to relocate to non-EU countries, thereby increasing their earnings many times over for their own interests alone, impoverishing our industrial districts.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we tabled some amendments aimed at extending this definition to semi-finished and intermediate products as well, so as to guarantee transparency and traceability of products imported from third countries, along the lines of Italy’s Reguzzoni law, which fully respects consumer rights. My fellow Members, this is truly the last chance we have to protect the manufacturing sector, in Italy and across Europe, which is one of the main drivers of the economy, unlike those few industrial giants that serve their own interests and not the good of the entire community.</p>
<p class="contents">Restricting rabid relocation, counterfeiting and the exploitation of labour must continue to be one of the aims of the European Parliament.

<p class="contents">In respect of this proposal, we need to strike a balance between the opening-up of markets for European products and ensuring the quality and safety of imported products. I must say, however, that I do see merit in third-country labelling when it comes to food products.

I am convinced that European consumers need to have this matter explained to them. I am also of the opinion that it must be our goal to protect the citizens of Europe from products that are dangerous and harmful to health. End users should know what raw materials are used, how these are obtained, where and how they are processed and what social and production standards apply in the relevant countries. The goal is clear, but we need clarity on how we intend to get there. Unfortunately, the current version of the proposed ‘Made in’ provision tell us nothing about the actual origins of a particular commodity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to illustrate this with an example: Uzbekistan is the world’s third largest exporter of cotton. Ninety per cent of the harvest is picked by hand, most of it using child labour. The gathered cotton is then shipped to Vietnam, where it is processed. According to the Commission’s current proposals, the textiles now imported into the EU from Vietnam should be labelled ‘Made in Vietnam’, but what about the transparency for the European consumer? Nobody knows where the raw materials come from and how they have been obtained. The level of information is quite inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Consumer Centre in Austria has published an up-to-date analysis, which indicates that the world’s leading and most prominent textile businesses are unable to guarantee that raw materials from state-sponsored companies involving child labour are not used in their production. A ‘Made in’ provision of this kind, which excludes raw materials from the production process, clearly misjudges the requirements of European end users. I am in favour of more truth in product labelling and therefore oppose this proposal from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not add costs for businesses in third countries, which are already obligated to mark their products in all our competitor countries in the world and in many others. Nor does it create any burdens for the European distribution system which, indirectly, without costing the public finances anything, favours the return to Europe of significant production, slows business relocation and also contributes to the fight against counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a combination of very obvious advantages, which cannot be halted by calling perhaps for further measures because here, it really is the case that the best is the enemy of the good. We must come to the end of a process that began seven years ago, showing our concern for the interests of our businesses – above all, in this time of crisis and unemployment – but also for the potential for a trade system regulated so as to provide reciprocity, consumer protection and correct information which could be further developed in terms of traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">If this measure is not voted through by Parliament, there will be trouble. I should like to thank the European Commission once again and all those who wish to support this measure, because it is helpful for European citizens and for world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More often than not, however, they have no way of knowing where the product was made, where the materials from which it is made came from, and what technological procedures the manufacturer used for its processing.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the maximum amount of information the consumer can have about a product is a basic pre-condition for good decision making when choosing goods. To this day, our European citizens have no right to elementary information about products, something which has been routinely available not only to the citizens of the United States since 1930, but also today to the people of China, Japan, Canada, India, Mexico and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe it is time the European Union adopted a norm which will protect European consumers regardless of the particular interests of large distribution chains or certain interest groups, and require suppliers to mark goods imported from third countries with the necessary information about their origin. In this way, our consumers will be provided with an important source of information when deciding which goods to choose, while third country manufacturers will not be substantially affected in any way because they have long been indicating the origin of their products to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it will be important to think through the mechanisms of the uniform application of sanctions and penalties for the violation of this legislation by any Member State in order to prevent manufacturers from seeking a point of entry to the common market of the European Union which is not properly safeguarded by sanctions, thereby avoiding compliance with the regulations. I firmly believe that introducing an effective system for marking the origin of products from third countries will be extremely beneficial both to our European consumers and to compliant manufacturers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must compete with imitations of unknown origin which are parasitic on the European Union market. We are mostly talking about poor quality and often harmful goods. In addition, information on where textiles, shoes, glass, jewellery or pharmaceutical products are produced is not classified information, nor does it constitute protectionism or a barrier to free trade, as liberals are labelling it. On the contrary, the free market and fair competition work well only if consumers can make good and free decisions on the basis of information and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, and I appreciate her contribution to achieving a compromise, which I hope will enable us to adopt the proposal tomorrow. I understand that, particularly in northern countries, where traditional products have been replaced by imports from other countries, such regulation may be regarded as unnecessary bureaucracy. However, let us compare the adoption of the regulation with our competitors in the USA, Canada, Japan and China, where ‘made in’ is obligatory. Like the previous speaker, I want to say that it is necessary for the Commission to propose at least minimum standards for penalties, and to ensure that the rules will be followed consistently across the Union and that third-country exporters will not give preference to certain countries because of lower or no sanctions.

This is a direct result of our traditions and European legal order. However, there are plenty of countries where such principles do not exist, where working conditions are poor, and where no guarantees exist for workers. I believe that, at the very least, European consumers must be able to recognise in future whether the products they are buying come from a particular country where basic principles do not apply.

<p class="contents">With regard to the safeguarding of small and medium-sized enterprises and their national products, it is not the big companies that need such protection. Indeed, I believe that they absolutely do not need it seeing as they travel the world with their brands. Furthermore, we must promote the specialties and traditional excellences of our countries, relaunch the European economy and guarantee the respect for the rights of workers in social, environmental and productive terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I wonder what we have to fear by telling the truth and aiming to establish rules that are equal for all.

The European Union is neither the first, nor the second or third, to request that its citizens be informed about the origin of a product they purchase for their needs or consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The US, Canada, Japan, India and many other countries have long been providing this right to their citizens. This is in accordance with the regulations of the World Trade Organisation. So the question is why have we not yet found a compromise? All of us agree on the need to inform the consumer citizen. However, it is also true that the indication of the country of origin, that is, the ‘made in’ provision, may be potentially misleading because globalisation in industry means that the end product is composed of parts made in different countries. Therefore, were we perhaps to add another label to that of ‘made in’, such as ‘processed in’ or ‘assembled in’, we might arrive at a broad agreement more easily. The greatest obstacle, which is the fear of providing incorrect, incomplete or misleading information, would thus be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that here in the European Parliament, to which the Treaty of Lisbon has granted greater authority in this very area, and led by the rapporteur, Mrs Muscardini, we will find common solutions which will help our citizens to make better and, most importantly, freer choices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, am of the belief that this measure represents an intermediate step. We must decide whether or not it is right that, when buying a product, a consumer knows where it has been made. We feel that it is right. This is a regulation that works towards transparency and the protection of consumer rights. It matters little to us right now if, in order to protect the rights of transparency and clarity for consumers, some business that has relocated finds itself penalised in some way.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened carefully to the words of my Swedish colleague, Mr Fjellner, who hails from Stockholm, to whom I feel the need to respond that I would like to have the confidence to go to his country to buy a typical Swedish-made suit in the certainty that it really was made in Sweden. This is because it could have the brand of a Swedish business even though it has been produced by a small manufacturing business, perhaps located 10 kilometres from my house. I should feel quite a fool if I went all the way to Sweden to buy something that was produced in my local area.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I welcome the mark of origin if it gives transparency and the chance of clarity and knowledge for consumers and, finally, a minimal response to the great many businesses that have had the courage not to relocate and have been crushed by unfair competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important instrument, but only that: an instrument. It is not – and let us not delude ourselves about this – a panacea.

<p class="contents">Let me just say with respect to the rules of origin that this is a very stabilised regime. These rules are very stable indeed and they are well known, because it is on the basis of these rules of origin that customs duties are paid when products come into the European market. In fact, our proposal fully relies on them. There can be no misunderstanding about that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second remark I would like to make is about an amendment introduced by Mrs Muscardini, which, in fact, proposes that this ‘made in’ regulation would be a kind of pilot project that would be evaluated after a four-year period and perhaps changed. I consider this an amendment worth supporting, because I imagine that it will enhance the chances that this proposal has in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why this proposal dating back to 2005 is not EU legislation is simply that the Council does not buy it. It has refused it until now, but the proposal by Mrs Muscardini to make a pilot project out of this for a five-year period, with an evaluation after four years, is a very good step in the right direction. That is why the Commission can accept the amendment proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Muscardini’s proposal solves the previous absence of European legislative standards in this area. The requirement to indicate the origin of products may contribute to the equalisation of conditions on the world trade market, because similar protection for domestic products is also insisted on by various global economies, such as the United States, Canada or Japan. Protection of this type accordingly helps goods produced in the European Union to be more competitive with goods from third countries. Indicating the country of origin also contributes to the preservation of traditional production methods, typical product characteristics and quality. This type of protection of European products will also have a positive effect on maintaining employment in all Member States. I would also like to state that indicating the country of origin increases consumer awareness and transparency when deciding to buy specific products, and prevents possible fraudulent claims about the origin of products or counterfeiting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, you asked me to come to the plenary to explain where we are in the negotiations on ACTA – the international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I share your view that this is an important dossier, and I am here for the third time in less than a year to discuss it with you.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we? Well, in two words, we are almost there. Indeed, on 2 October 2010, negotiators from the EU and 10 other countries concluded the last round of negotiations. They have resolved nearly all issues with only a few still open. I will come back to that later.</p>
<p class="contents">A consolidated and largely stabilised text of the proposed agreement was made public two weeks ago. I hope that this has allowed you to find out that the Commission has scrupulously respected the principles that I laid out in my previous interventions in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to remember that ACTA is an agreement concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights. This means that it does not oblige any of its signatories to create new, substantive rights or to change existing ones. It only commits its signatories to ensuring that the rights holders can fully assert their rights if, when and where they exist.</p>
<p class="contents">ACTA is about establishing a new tool that will ensure that existing intellectual property rights are effectively protected. This is essential if we want to maintain a leading role in the ‘knowledge economy’. Contrary to what some seem to be claiming, ACTA is not about creating some sort of ‘Big Brother’.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that you had concerns with the fact that the negotiations were conducted behind closed doors and that the negotiating texts were not made public. At the insistence of the Commission, successive versions of the text have been published and our negotiators came here after each round to answer all your questions. We have taken these steps to ensure that we could debate the topic in a climate of mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention that the Ombudsman has recently recognised, in the precise context of the ACTA negotiations, that it was justified to maintain the confidentiality of some key negotiating documents. The Ombudsman confirmed that the preservation of confidentiality was legal and in line with the 2001 Regulation on access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now highlight some of the main features of ACTA. Firstly, a broad coverage of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Given the diversity of IPRs, on which European operators rely to protect their inventions, we have fought for, and obtained, broad coverage. In particular, we have managed to ensure that Europe’s geographical indications (GIs) will be treated equally.	</p>
<p class="contents">This is an EU success. It would not be in the draft ACTA Treaty without the European Commission. I know that it may not go as far as some would have liked – for example, as regards border measures. Justified differences will remain, and ACTA Parties will not have to adopt the EU system of protecting GIs through <span class="italic">sui generis</span> systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ACTA defines for the first time an international standard for intellectual property infringements on the Internet. The Internet is the most global, open and fast-moving market environment, where music, films, books and software circulate. Millions of counterfeit goods are traded every day through the Internet. ACTA thus represents a ground-breaking – yet balanced – level of harmonisation and transparency for the rules applicable to such infringements, whilst remaining fully in line with the EU acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that ACTA will not change the EU acquis. Our negotiating guidelines requested this and we have scrupulously respected it, as you can see from the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, ACTA provides a balanced agreement, which replies to the four main concerns expressed by Members, for the following four reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the text does not affect the protection of fundamental rights, privacy and data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it respects the important role of free Internet and safeguards the role of service providers, as well as the European system of copyright exceptions, such as the European regime of conditional exemption of liability for Internet operators. European exceptions, like private or educational use, will also remain valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the text refers to those provisions of the TRIPS agreement that safeguard the essential balance between the rights of the right holders and the public interest, and that stress the ‘need for intellectual property rights to contribute to technical innovation, socio-economic welfare, or the protection of health’.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, ACTA explicitly recognises the importance of guaranteeing access to medicines, by referring to the Doha Declaration on the matter, as well as by explicitly excluding patent infringements from the sections on border and penal enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the state of play and the next steps in ACTA? Well, in Tokyo, it was not possible to finalise the text. The parties kept a few reservations, which still need to be addressed in the coming weeks. There are, in particular, two issues open.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, should patent infringements be included or excluded from the scope of civil litigation measures? I would be interested to hear your views on this issue. I am concerned that a blanket exclusion of patents – an important intellectual property right – might risk depriving many industries of the benefits of this chapter. I am thinking, for example, of the automotive, machinery, pharmaceutical and agro-chemical sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the other important issue has to do with the EU proposal that the Internet measures stipulated in ACTA must apply not only to copyright but – at least – also to trademark violations. As you know, on the Internet, you can find thousands of offers for fake goods using European brands, be it for clothes, cosmetics, watches or even foodstuffs. I believe we should address these infringements made through the Internet because they are basically identical to real-life infringements concerning physical goods.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am firmly convinced of the importance of tackling the widespread abuse of European intellectual property around the world. ACTA can provide an important contribution towards this goal, in full compliance with existing European legislation. ACTA is the first important international agreement on IPRs since the TRIPS agreement in the WTO back in 1994. It also strikes a proper balance with the rights of citizens and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to a continued close dialogue with the European Parliament and towards the successful conclusion of the agreement and its subsequent approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is right and important that we should assure the European Parliament that the Commission really does report on the status of negotiations in a transparent way. I believe that this also places us in a position to evaluate, and therefore approve or reject, such an agreement on the basis of solid data.</p>
<p class="contents">My impression at the moment is that many critics are running out of arguments against the ACTA agreement. I think it is a good thing that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> remains unchanged. It would be really great if the Commission could once again show us that this really is copper-fastened. There are still some Members of this House who have their doubts about this and I would be grateful if the Commission could explain this issue once again in a clear, unambiguous way – perhaps even having the Commission’s legal service check the matter out. I believe it is a positive thing that the ACTA agreement is apparently focusing on the implementation of existing law, rather than the framing of new laws.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the section on the Internet. It is high time that we took action in relation films, music, books and software circulating on the Internet. I am not looking to criminalise any of our citizens, but I believe that it must be possible for artists and creators also to pursue their intellectual property rights on the Internet and I welcome the fact that the ACTA agreement offers a first step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would definitely have preferred to deal with the entire issue in the context of the WTO. However, I also note that we lacked suitable partners in dialogue within the WTO, which is why the ACTA agreement is certainly a good start. I would be grateful if the Commission, possibly after the conclusion of the ACTA agreement, would do all it can to ensure that as many other countries as possible sign up to this agreement and would also demonstrate a little flexibility in cases where doubts exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that you have succeeded in including information on geographical origin – such as champagne, Scotch whisky, Parma ham, etc. – I would like to congratulate you on this. I believe this is a huge step forward for the interests of the European Union. It must be possible to secure and protect our European origin labelling and information in the same way as trademarks like Coca Cola, Kellogg’s Cornflakes, etc. I believe we must take active steps here in the interests of our producers.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised a question in relation to patents: on the one hand, the title of this agreement clearly points in a different direction; however, on the other hand, our businesses are experiencing enormous problems in this regard and I would suggest that perhaps we could discuss this issue with you in detail on Monday when you attend the meeting of the Committee on International Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations on what you have achieved. I would encourage you to show perseverance with regard to the outstanding issues. I look forward to the day when this House can decide whether to approve or reject the agreement on the basis of the final wording. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I asked for transparency and you responded. Today, I am somewhat concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as I see it, beyond the purely technical issues, the main risk is that of the direction we are beginning to take with regard to this increasingly complex relationship between individual freedoms and the Internet. The world is changing rapidly, and we are all aware of this. We are all aware of the revolution taking place in access not only to information but also to culture via this tool.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s world, where such access is immediate and free, traditional reference points are being undermined. Our most complex task is, therefore, to define new regulations, because regulation is necessary not only to protect artists and rights holders; but I do not want to see individual freedoms ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the protection of freedoms, one of the most important of which is the protection of the right to privacy, one of my main concerns is the possibility afforded by the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) of travellers’ personal effects and baggage being checked at borders. Does this mean that our mobile telephones, our MP3 players and our computers may be searched by customs authorities looking for illegally downloaded files?</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, this is just a possibility, because the precise term used in the text is not binding. It is said that the Member States may choose whether or not to allow their personal luggage to be searched. However, let us get serious here for a minute. How can one expect such wording not to be seen as incitement to carry out such checks? Do you really think that a government, especially if it is pressurised to some extent by its music industry – and I cite this example deliberately – will not take this opportunity afforded by ACTA to move its national legislation towards increased screening of passengers entering its territory?</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is that, if it is proved that the files held by a private individual are for commercial use, punishment is automatic. However, who determines whether the files we hold are of a commercial nature or not? Some may say that a person with 500 songs on his or her MP3 player necessarily has commercial objectives, but why would others deny themselves the opportunity to fix this limit at 300, 100, 50 or 10? In fact, for an ill-intentioned person, all it takes is to illegally download a single film in order to make thousands of copies of it, and that then becomes commercial activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, punishment will be meted out by the courts of each country, but a European citizen arrested by the border authorities of a signatory country on the basis of particularly binding legislation will have no means of challenging it. Is it your wish that such an abuse be possible? Was it not the responsibility of the Commission precisely to do everything it could to ensure that the agreement prohibits searches of personal effects?</p>
<p class="contents">I have deliberately raised only this issue this evening, but you have raised many more, which we will incorporate into the resolution I have requested and which will ordinarily be voted on in next month’s plenary. Commissioner, I would ask you to take account of the outcome of this vote, which will be in line with our commitment, that is, to take account of the word of the European Parliament before you sign the act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications. ‘Parmesan’ – one of a number of possible examples – can be freely produced as ‘Parmesan’ in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications. Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I should like a clarification in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Parmesan’ means ‘from Parma’, not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications. We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years’ time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today’s mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity. In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned. The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet. Much has been gained on this issue. The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1).</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there. So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression – for now – is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an agreement that entails a whole series of commitments by the contracting parties in strengthening the enforcement of intellectual property rights. We, as Members of the European Parliament, will soon be asked by you, the Commission, to approve this agreement. However, for months now, Parliament has made it clear that a number of the declarations of intent made by the EU within the ACTA agreement run the risk of going beyond current EU law. Not only is it unclear whether sufficient competence exists for this kind of trade agreement, involving as it does provisions such as punitive measures or intervention in fundamental rights, we also lack information on the extent to which ACTA will necessitate the introduction of illegal measures in the EU. For this reason, ACTA will have to be sent back to the negotiating table. And yet you are willing to sign up to the agreement now. That is why I would ask you firstly: Have you already signed? If not, when do you intend to sign? Secondly: When will we receive a detailed impact assessment on the extent to which ACTA could affect fundamental rights within the EU?

I think the move towards transparency is something which should be welcomed across the Parliament. After all, that was one of the areas of consensus across the Parliament – we may have disagreed on certain elements, but we agreed on more and more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">An increase in transparency means that we reduce false speculation about the content of the negotiations, but also, to be fair, highlights the positive role played by the Commission in trying to persuade the negotiating partners of the need for greater transparency. I think we played a role in this Parliament in putting pressure on the Commission, so it, in turn, can talk to its negotiating partners about the need for greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">There are obviously differences of opinion in this House on intellectual property rights. It is clearly a key issue for copyright and trademark holders. ACTA, I hope, is an important step in terms of enforcement among all active parties and builds on the TRIPS agreement of the mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I think a distinction should be made between the digital world and the world of atoms; in a world of increased processing power, increased storage and increased bandwidth, you see a tendency towards a price of zero and many in the music industry, for example, have failed to react. I understand from speaking to legal experts, however, that it is very difficult to codify that in an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the production of generic medicines, I am glad that ACTA protects copyrights and trademarks while excluding patents from border measures, so you avoid the seizure of generic medicine in transit through the EU. But I do have a question since the Commission was not responsible for negotiating on behalf of the EU when it came to the criminal enforcement chapter which was dealt with by the Council on behalf of Member States. How, when we have this debate about concerns over the criminal sanctions, do we intend to reconcile the two different negotiations between the civil and the criminal chapter?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question for you, Mr Commissioner. You can shrug, but it will be interesting to hear your perspective on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Be assured that we in this House are fulfilling our duty by examining the agreement in the context of the laws of the European Union. My group favours adopting a thorough approach and taking as much time as necessary, even though you have once again offered very detailed answers to the questions regarding the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. This is because the questions that we were able to ask the Commission in the debriefing sessions which you recently offered us after the negotiations, and for which I would like to thank you, were not really answered to our complete satisfaction. Your chief negotiator often gave us the feeling that we were – if I might express myself in colloquial terms at this point – a bit like God-botherers who sought to question holy writ, rather than dealing with the concerns we voiced on behalf of the citizens of Europe.</p>

The wording of the latest version of the agreement already reads like legislative text as it applies in individual Member States. Thus, the ACTA agreement will leave the existing legal situation in Europe almost unchanged. The original aim of the agreement was to improve enforcement. However, I am unable to identify any specific solutions in this regard from the proposal. Prior to publication, it became known that the disputed points were to be dropped. However, this version does not seem to take adequate account of the various conflicting interests. For example, Article 2(2) of the agreement reads: ‘Procedures adopted, maintained, or applied to implement this Chapter shall be fair, equitable and provide for the rights of all participants subject to procedures to be appropriately protected’. The chapter on temporary measures contains no explicit reference to the right to due legal process, neither is there a provision for verifying the need to destroy counterfeit products.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least – we hear that the last points of the negotiation are to finalised by e-mail. However, these last points include the area of application of the agreement as a whole. Surely this should be defined before we start on the formulation of the content. Perhaps this would then also give rise to some practical solutions in the agreement itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are still far from a solution to the problems of intellectual property, which continue to be the subject of a dispute between two blocks that differ both economically and politically. Europe must continue to concentrate on two fundamental points. It must be compulsory for European geographic indications to be protected in both civil and customs terms, as these are today suffering damage that affects not only the agro-food industry, whose counterfeited products suffer unfair competition through the use of names that copy and evoke familiar European brands, but also damages industries operating in the design and fashion sectors. This damages businesses, intellectual property, research and – as always – the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">A second central point is the need for common rules controlling online sales: the sale of films, books, music, medicines and millions of other counterfeited goods continue to take place on the Internet, without any controls. The European Union must send a clear message to the rest of the world: the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement must be a bulwark against all counterfeiting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Members of Parliament, it is vital that we are able to exercise our right of veto as often as is necessary, but our work has now been made virtually impossible. Time and again, we have been forced to ask the Commission to clarify the state of play in the negotiations on ACTA. However, we are constantly being fobbed off with words. First, we were reassured with the argument that the negotiations are far from over and now you have told us that this is merely an enforcement agreement and that no changes will be made to EU acquis or the law of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In that case, I would ask: what is then the added value of ACTA? You have said that it will neither harmonise criminal sanctions nor impose any indirect obligation, in terms of the ‘three strikes’ policy. However, we are standing here, talking yet again about the content of this draft agreement and, specifically, about the points which I have mentioned. Yet, every day, I receive messages from concerned citizens and companies and, still, there is a general consensus among the groups in the European Parliament that this draft agreement undermines the fundamental rights of our citizens and passengers from third countries. I will therefore put this question to you in no uncertain terms: what will be the specific benefits of adopting ACTA? Do, please, persuade us that this text from 2 October is a positive and necessary thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a very specific question for you, Commissioner: when will the negotiating parties meet again to discuss ACTA? Which parties have failed to agree to it? Why was that? One question after another, Commissioner. Once again, we have been told that the finishing touches have not yet been added to the agreement.

As liberals, we proposed this, so this is music to my ears.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Commission posted information on ACTA after the end of the last negotiations three weeks ago. The site has a paragraph called ‘positive aspects of ACTA’, but there are also some questions that might be labelled otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, do trade agreements or law enforcement treaties – which I think ACTA really is – also fall under the mainstreaming of fundamental rights? Will the Commission do an assessment?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, is the Commission willing to go back to the negotiating table if fundamental rights are at risk through ACTA? Will the Commission wait to finalise the negotiations to take the Parliament’s resolution of early next year into real account? As far as I know, no country has put its initials on a single page of ACTA.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the Internet, ACTA even breaks new ground, the statement reads. The preamble states that ACTA seeks ‘to promote cooperation between service providers and rights holders’. Article 2.18.3 goes on: ‘each party shall endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively copyright infringements. This implies extra-judicial measures and challenges the division of power’. Article 2.18.4 states that the competent authority, not necessarily judicial, should have the power ‘to order an online provider to disclose expeditiously to a rights holder information sufficient to identify a subscriber whose account was allegedly used for infringement’.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides pointing to the word ‘allegedly’, I would like to stress that Internet service providers are concerned that they will have to start enforcing the law. So, some room needs to be made under the heading ‘negative aspects of ACTA’ to assess the fundamental rights aspect that ACTA still has in the current draft and that the Commission from now on is legally obliged to mainstream. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is partly due to the very unclear and vague legal terminology used in places, which seems to rule nothing out and everything in. Let me just touch on one key issue here, which is the call for cooperation between service providers and rights holders in implementing rights. Are we to take this to mean that, for example, Warner Brothers would work together with ISPs almost like deputy sheriffs? How would this work in detail? Would it mean streaming the Internet in order to identify violations? This confusion stems from the fact that, for example, the term ‘private use or commercial use’ is not adequately defined and a common definition has not been found. I believe this to be an extremely problematic issue because it entails the privatisation of legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, yesterday, the Commission gave an undertaking that there will be an impact assessment in relation to civil rights in any new provisions. When can we expect this impact assessment in relation to the ACTA agreement? What can we expect from this assessment and when will we actually be able to read it?

There is no one-size-fits-all approach in the enforcement, or approach to enforcement, in the agreement. Flexibility for our Member States is recognised; we support that. ACTA, as the Commissioner said, is a good first step to tackling counterfeit groups and piracy on the Internet and wider afield.</p>

It has been highly controversial here in the European Parliament, but also in Sweden, which I represent. I have been very critical, particularly towards much of what I have seen as secretiveness; the fact that texts have been kept secret, among other things. This has created a feeling and an atmosphere in which myths surrounding the agreement could thrive. The most stubborn of all seems to be the myth that, as a consequence of ACTA, customs will start to inspect ipods and computers. I heard this most recently here in plenary today. However, now that we have all of the texts and everything is on the table, I can see that it was wrong and just a myth. I believe that if Shakespeare had written a play about the debate surrounding ACTA, he would have named this one ‘Much Ado about Nothing’, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised that ACTA will not change anything in EU legislation and, on reading this, I understand the same. The fact that there will be no changes to legislation means that there will be no changes to citizen’s everyday lives and this will not change citizen’s involvement with the Internet, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it does not mean that ACTA is not important or that it is unnecessary, as someone said here in this Chamber. On the contrary, ACTA will create a global gold standard for the protection of intellectual property. This is important and it is in the interests of both Sweden and Europe. It will reduce the number of conflicts and, if there is something that I hear when I meet Swedish companies, it is, above all, the need to protect patents and the intellectual property rights that they have. This is good, particularly outside Europe. I feel reassured and confident now that I have read the negotiation documents that we have received. I am certain that citizens will feel that way, too. This means that I feel quite confident ahead of the continued debating of this matter in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the moment, my thanks will stop there, because this text remains highly ambiguous on key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, you say, Commissioner, that this text will not change the EU acquis, but what about the new criminal sanctions for the crime of aiding and abetting copyright infringements, which, however, you wish to distinguish from counterfeiting?</p>
<p class="contents">How can we not think of what is happening in France with the threat of the Hadopi law and potential sanctions against the neutrality of technical intermediaries. The fact that this text was negotiated by the Council places it outside the Commission’s scope of negotiation and therefore, perhaps, of the EU acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would seem that the ACTA committee has the possibility of integrating amendments into texts. You will therefore understand our concern at the prospect of adopting a text that might be amended. Once again, Commissioner, it is difficult for us to present the future ACTA Secretariat with a blank cheque and the reservations we will formulate on the interpretation of the text when we vote on the resolution will dictate our position on the ratification of this text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because we do not want Internet service providers (ISPs) to start acting as private police forces and be forced to take on that role.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly said in various oral statements that this is not the case. I welcome those statements. However, when you look at the text, it is already in the preamble, ‘desiring to promote cooperation between service providers and rights holders with respect to relevant infringements in the digital environment’. Then, in Article 2.18.3, as Mrs Schaake quoted, ‘shall endeavour to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively address corporate infringements’. If this does not mean three strikes, what does it mean?</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to talk about cooperation between rights holders and ISPs but what are the ISPs supposed to do? If they do not want to do it, what measures will be taken against the ISPs? I am very concerned that the language in this agreement – as Mrs Castex was saying –is so ambiguous that it is not really clear what it means. I still have the basic concerns that have been with us all along, and I would very much like to see a proper evaluation of the fundamental rights aspects of this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, when considering such agreements, at some point we must stop and ask: who will benefit and who will suffer as a result? I get the feeling that in fact, it benefits just a few people who want to make a fat profit and who have little interest in upholding human rights, freedom of information, etc. and that it actually harms far more people than it genuinely benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I am still not clear about the actual situation with regard to generics. Admittedly, there is not a lot that can be achieved through criminal penalties. However, we know that civil actions and the associated major compensation claims, etc. can inflict far more damage than criminal proceedings. Then the question of trademark protection versus origin markings arises. We have just had a discussion where it was stated that origin markings are gaining increasing importance and offer opportunities beyond the ambit of trademark protection. However, everything seems to have got hung up on the issue of trademark protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of using Internet providers as a de facto private police force, something that has already been mentioned by other Members of the House, is a concept that I utterly reject. Who is going to control the providers? There is no duty to provide information and no data protection, as should really be the case with public bodies. These are all things that give me cause for concern. Furthermore, I do not know what these impact assessments will achieve in terms of human rights and, above all, what the Commission will do if this House forms the impression that this is a watered-down solution and refuses to endorse it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, an agreement which states that the business community must cooperate in order to combat copyright infringement, now that is where it seems to me that things start to get a bit more complicated. If I may return to the subject of handbags, I take it that a tanner might have to ask a manufacturer of zips and buckles to check the identity of the people that are buying those bags? Are we, as authorities, then going to impose such a policing task on those kinds of companies? Now, that would be an ill-advised development and you have not given us any clarification of this point in your proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard you say, Mr De Gucht, that you fear that, if we drop patents from ACTA, we will have the pharmaceutical industry on our backs. I have a different fear, because ambiguities still exist as regards patents and border controls. That is not to say that something as embarrassing as the seizing of anti-HIV drugs in the port of Rotterdam will not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Put our minds at ease, Mr De Gucht, and test ACTA against fundamental rights. Yesterday, your Commission published a strategy to that effect. Reassure us that people in developing countries have a right to healthcare. Reassure us that Internet users will not be pried on by commercial companies and that their freedom will not be limited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also clearly presents a risk to consumers and is the cause of job losses in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a multilateral agreement to combat piracy and counterfeiting may be an effective mechanism for curbing such activities. However, I join my colleagues in emphasising the need for transparency and better credibility in any such negotiations and agreements. I consider it equally essential that a balance be struck between the rights we are interested in protecting and the rights that are essential in society. The enforcement or protection of the rights of some must not encroach on the rights and justified interests of others. I refer, in particular, to the provisions of the agreement which intend to criminalise completely harmless ordinary users but will not penalise the big players. It seems absurd to me that during border controls, technical equipment containing audio and video recordings for personal use may be confiscated. In our legal tradition, copying for personal use without commercial purposes is common and not illegal. Commissioner, why should a student, for example, be unable to make a copy of a book he needs for school?</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I stress that we need to give the green light to acceptable copyright protection. However, behind the current version of ACTA is the work of the lobbyists of US recording companies who, in their pursuit of profit, intend to terrorise and criminalise a large part of our society, and the citizens of the Member States of the European Union in particular. I consider the astronomical fines, inappropriate checks, negotiations on the agreement behind closed doors, and so on disproportionate. Therefore, I would like to ask the European Commission to resist the enormous pressure from the lobbyists and prepare a rational and well-balanced alternative to the current version of ACTA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the draft agreements have finally been published and that most of the problems that we criticised have disappeared from the agreement. However, it would be a failure for the Union if, for example, protection for geographical indications were cut back; for example, if non-European countries were not required to protect Karlovy Vary waffles, or the aforementioned champagne, throughout their territory. It is not enough merely to control the borders. I ask the Commissioner for clarification on this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also have doubts about the effectiveness of the agreement given that the biggest global counterfeiters from Asia are not parties to it, which, in addition, may cause trouble for entrepreneurs and consumers when implementing the agreement.

<p class="contents">The joint declaration of 16 April issued by all the ACTA parties is quite clear. There is no proposal to force ACTA participants to require border authorities to search travellers’ baggage or their personal electronic devices for infringing materials.</p>
<p class="contents">ACTA is about tackling large-scale, illegal activity and pursuing criminal organisations. It is not about limiting civil liberties or harassing consumers. ACTA will be in line with the current EU regime for enforcement of IPRs, which fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms and civil liberties, such as the protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">One example is the <span class="italic">di minimis</span> clause in the 2003 EU customs regulation that exempts travellers from checks if the infringing goods are not part of large-scale traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">EU customs, frequently confronted with drug trafficking, weapons or people, have neither the time nor the legal basis to look for a couple of pirated songs on an iPod or laptop computer, and we have no intention of changing this.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not change this, and we will ensure that ACTA parties can continue to apply such an exemption. However, we cannot impose the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> exemption as an absolute obligation, because some Member States acting under national rules have kept the authority to carry out certain controls of passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made again to the three-strike law or the HADOPI law in France which makes this possible. However, this is a national rule and the European Union does not have the authority to make a national state change this.</p>
<p class="contents">Several have also been asking for an impact assessment on fundamental rights, an impact study on privacy and an impact study on the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made several statements in this plenary that there has been no infringement whatsoever of fundamental rights or the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in any way, and I must say that in the three debates that we have already had in this plenary, none of you has given an example of problems related to fundamental liberties. Nobody has pointed to an infringement of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Nobody has been able to give an example. If you give us examples, we will look into them.</p>
<p class="contents">As for negotiating behind closed doors, Parliament has been asking for more transparency on the ACTA negotiations. It is the Commission that has made sure that this happens; that you have the text before you that was negotiated in Tokyo, and that you got it a couple of days after it was finalised. You have it also with the reserves that still exist; three on the part of the European Union, three on the part of the United States. You have the result of the negotiations. How can you say that this has happened behind closed doors?</p>
<p class="contents">The question has been put to the Ombudsman. Maybe you do not trust me. I am the Commission. Maybe you do not trust the Council. Maybe you do not trust your governments. I have detected from a lot of speeches here that your trust in national governments is not very deep, but I think you at least trust the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has said very clearly that we can keep documents confidential, and what we have been doing is making a large additional step in the direction of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">You would expect that when you do that, you would be applauded. At least there would be some consideration for the fact, but some of you simply continue to say that we negotiate behind closed doors and that there is no transparency. So what is the use in making an effort to have more transparency if afterwards, you still continue to say that there is no transparency? Maybe I would be better investing my time in something else.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the possibility of the European Commission agreeing on a final text: in the Lisbon Treaty, there are, in fact, very clear rules on how international agreements are negotiated, by whom and how they are concluded and ratified, including the important role of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also clear rules in the framework agreement as to how Parliament must be informed and heard during the negotiating process. I think we have respected these rules scrupulously. It is the Commission’s prerogative, as a negotiator, to determine the point at which negotiations are technically finalised and at which the agreement can be initialled. The agreement is not yet initialled and you have the possibility tonight to make your remarks before we even do the initialling and before we even decide to initial the agreement as such. We have not yet made a decision in the Commission on what we are actually going to do, because we still have a couple of reserves that we want to settle with the United States before making up our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">The initialling of the agreement is part of the Commission’s prerogatives and it does not definitely bind the Union. The agreement will become definitive once the European Parliament has given its consent.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us respect the treaty and let us respect the framework agreements. In the meantime, we will continue to inform and engage with you as stipulated in the framework agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, according to the treaty, it is the Council which authorises the signature of the agreements, but Parliament always has the last word. It has to ratify this agreement and if consent is refused, there is simply no agreement at all.</p>
<p class="contents">So be a little bit patient. There is no initialling yet. Once there is initialling, you have the translation, you have the check by the lawyer-linguists, and then it comes to the Council for signature and to Parliament for ratification. So no decision whatsoever has been taken at this moment in time, and you have another possibility tonight to make known all the comments that you have on your mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have also been asking how the EU would benefit by entering into such an agreement if it will go no further than its current laws and if, furthermore, other countries like the US also claim that it will not change domestic law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about substantive law. This agreement is about the enforcement of existing law, and that is why I have repeatedly stipulated that we are not going to change the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. The <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is about substantive law and we are not changing that. An international treaty that would adopt standards similar to those of the EU, but also to those already in place in countries like the US or Japan, would still be a most valuable contribution to the current prevailing international standard as defined by the WTO TRIPS agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is to promote ACTA standards to key emerging partners, namely through our future trade agreements, but also in multilateral venues. That being said, several ACTA parties have taken the momentum created by the ACTA negotiations to revise their domestic legislation along the agreed lines.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am aware, for instance, both Japan and Canada are in the process of reviewing their Internet enforcement regimes. Moreover, it is often overlooked that ACTA is not only about improved legal standards. It is also about cooperation between enforcement authorities, the adoption of best practices or the better coordination of technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the EU has had very successful cooperation with the US in these areas for the last four to five years, we believe that ACTA can also improve those important aspects of the fight against IPR infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the US enforcement system is generally effective and efficient in the protection of certain intellectual property rights. The Commission has stressed that ACTA is not a disguised means to circumvent their domestic legislative process and to devise their current laws and so has Parliament. It is understandable that US officials stress the same line.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that the principle of cooperation between rightholders is already in Article 15 of the e-Commerce Directive since 2003, so this is not a new concept. It is in the e-Commerce Directive and we are simply referring to that. We are referring to the existing EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me further say that what is often overlooked in the debate on ACTA are the number of jobs of EU citizens that relate to intellectual property rights and we often discuss jobs on all sides of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of jobs in Europe depend on respect for intellectual property rights. Counterfeiting is a serious attack on European industry and on the European economy and on European innovation, because we are an innovation-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are really talking about is jobs. And I must say that I am a little bit surprised that in the three discussions that we have now had in this plenary, this has never in fact been mentioned. This reference to jobs has never been made. The references that are made are to fundamental rights and I am very sensitive to that, but without any confirmative example.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference is made to controls at the borders where it is clear that ACTA adds nothing to what already exists. There is a reference to privacy and I see no reason why privacy would be under attack. There are references to a kind of nebulous liberty and liberties that you think are under attack, but you do not give any examples of that. On the other hand, what is very clear, and what is documented in all kinds of impact studies that have already been done by the way by the Commission, on all kinds of items, is that a lot of our jobs are linked to intellectual property rights and that is one of the reasons we attach such importance to that topic. I am a little bit surprised that this is very rarely mentioned by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This agreement is an absolute necessity for establishing common international standards on the enforcement of intellectual property legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must point out that sanction measures against intellectual property infringements must comply with the principle of proportionality and balance between the gravity of the acts committed and the sanctions applied. In this case, I am referring, in particular, to intellectual property infringements in the digital media and Internet where a clear difference ought to be made in terms of treatment between large-scale piracy for commercial purposes and isolated, random cases of intellectual fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, regardless of the seriousness of the offences committed, the agreement should focus particular attention on protecting freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and confidentiality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title31"></a><a name="creitem31"></a>
