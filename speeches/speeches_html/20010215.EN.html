You may go for a nap in between because eight minutes really is rather long.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is now almost a year since it was agreed during the European Council in Lisbon that the European Union wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and this Parliament rallied around that goal with a large majority. If the European Union wants to achieve this goal, then more investment in research, technological development, innovation and education is essential, both in the Member States as well as at European level. The creation of a European Research Area is vital to this. European research has proved a success: and the innovative efforts of Europe's businesses are also impressive, accounting in the first half of the 1990s for 33% of turnover. The European Framework Programmes of research and technological development have definitely contributed to this as well. The success of the Framework Programmes must therefore be retained in the future and that will also have to be demonstrated when the proposals for the sixth Framework Programme are discussed. But at the moment, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question of having one European research policy. The proposals made by Commissioner Busquin in order to actually bring such a policy about were well received by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but on a number of points we still have a few gaps to fill and some concerns to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of creating an effective research area would be to ensure more cooperation on the basis of more Community objectives and flexible use of resources. Let us do away with techno-nationalism. The research policies of the Member States and that of the Union are currently pursued alongside each other without forming a coherent whole. In addition, we invest significantly less in research than the United States and Japan. These two factors mean that the ground lost to the United States has simply increased in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">In my first report on the European Research Area, I also went on about techno-nationalism, which has to vanish. Greater cooperation is needed between the Member States, researchers and research groups, but also between companies, universities and public research institutes. More coordination at a programme level is also necessary. There is a need for new forms of European cooperation, namely intermediary cooperation, or in other words between national research institutes as well as between the establishments which subsidise research in the Member States. But, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in Europe will stand or fall with a state-of-the-art infrastructure. It is vital to extend a high-speed trans-European research network with a capacity of ten gigabits to a hundred gigabits in the future, in order to achieve a European Research Area and enable it to perform optimally. Only then will we also achieve cooperation such as that between centres of excellence. This goal will never be reached with the SEAN project, which is based on an increase of two gigabits per second per year. I therefore call upon Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin to show much more ambition in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the creation of a European Research Area, we also have need of a European Educational Area, since a dynamic knowledge-based economy, which was talked about so much in Lisbon, requires not only high quality education at the same level in all Member States, but also mobility amongst researchers and students. Greater harmony between higher education and researcher training is necessary as well. I would like to hear the Commissioner's point of view on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements reached in Nice concerning flexibility, variable geometry, or cooperation between a limited number of Member States in the field of research, create an obstacle for the Industry Committee. This forms a central part of Commissioner Busquin's plans. The Industry Committee expresses the strongest possible reservations concerning this cooperation between Member States, particularly if it involves spending European research funds. As it so happens, the Research Committee, this Parliament in other words, has the power of codecision where research at European level is concerned. If this brings about cooperation between the Member States, whereby the Member States finance this themselves, then there is no problem at all. But as soon as European funding is put into research from which only a couple of Member States profit as a result, then the codecision procedure will indeed have to be retained. That is laid down in the Treaty. That is why I would like to see the details of these plans take on a clearer shape, although we are definitely not opposed to more cooperation – because for all that, I have also said: let us do away with techno-nationalism – but as soon as European funding is in the picture, Parliament's power of codecision remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of research. In the fifth Framework Programme we argued in favour of spending at least 10% on small and medium-sized enterprises within the thematic programmes. That was successful too. It appears that even more funding is going to small and medium-sized enterprises from the Fifth Framework Programme. In my report for the Industry Committee, we established once again that at least 10% must be spent on SMEs. Nevertheless I believe that having regard to current spending we can well afford to be a bit more ambitious, so I put it to you that in the coming Framework Programme the amount should be increased to 15% and, of course, I welcome your views on this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, Mr President, relates to an issue about which there is considerable doubt in Parliament and that is nuclear fusion research. Essentially, Parliament has very little to report on this, except that we do have to make the budget available. We were surprised, therefore, that you went to the Council to ask for their opinion on what should happen now with fusion, even before you made a statement yourself which would normally go to the Council and Parliament at the same time. I think that that is a slight reversal of the procedure. We hope therefore that you will ask our opinion on this as well and indeed also give an opinion on the budget that you would like to have seen, but we shall have to approve that first. So in fact we are asking to be fully involved in determining the policy regarding fusion research, as well as in determining the direction that it should take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How utterly astonishing, then, that every country in the world and every Member State of the European Union wastes half of its most valuable resource, that is, the brain power of its citizens. It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are not encouraged at school level, they face discrimination in their careers, and this is something which we have to tackle in the European Research Area. I congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, the rapporteur, and Commissioner Busquin, both of whom have realised the importance of this gap. I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Busquin has upgraded the work of his directorate-general in this matter to the status of a unit, that he is ensuring that statistics are being kept, and that networks which help and encourage women scientists are being supported by the European Union. This must be a key part of the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, as the phrase goes, research by women, for women – so that the gender implications of the research we undertake are examined – and about women. It is important that the socio-economic aspects of the research programme concentrate on gender matters. Why is it that almost every country in the world wastes the brains of half its population by not encouraging them?</p>

I am glad that the report takes these questions on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which unanimously adopted a report, part of which has been incorporated into the report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy; I want to emphasise the word "part".</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I am very glad that the human and social sciences will henceforth be regarded not just as a means of research but also as an end. The issue of women is part of the question, but, of course, today we are discussing something much wider. The fact that human and social sciences are now becoming a field of research in their own right means that we have reached a turning point in research in Europe. I think that needs pointing out. Perhaps it will help us think about how to achieve the political and cultural integration of Europe, given that research is an element of this integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also struck by the emphasis placed on the extent to which the new technologies, which are so important today – we discussed that yesterday, in relation to copyright – promote cultural diversity through the question of languages. That is another point we in the Committee on Culture consider extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Sixth Framework Programme, I am pleased to see that the research on cultural identity that we proposed has been incorporated into the report that the Committee on Industry adopted. I hope the Commission will also take this into account. I think it is important to have the possibility of carrying out research on cultural identity, as it is to renew some of the key actions of the Fifth Framework Programme, such as 'multimedia content and tools' and 'city of tomorrow and cultural heritage'.</p>
<p class="contents">I somewhat regret, however, that the Committee on Industry has not incorporated our opinion on Internet costs. Research on Internet costs could have made it possible to reduce them and finally make the Internet more democratic. As for networks of excellence, that is all very well, but we can also, within the European Research Area, create networks that are not just networks of excellence. That is something we also need for the sake of mobility but also for the sake of research itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, of course, there is the question of intellectual property. It could be a great help to Europe in safeguarding its cultural identity and democracy if research were carried out on the technical aspects of intellectual property rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must reiterate what a pleasure it has been to work with her on these matters. Likewise, I should like to express our sincere appreciation to Commissioner Busquin for his constant readiness to take our contributions on board. His door is always open, he is increasing his contacts with the groups and we are grateful to him for that. I do not believe it is an exaggeration to venture to say that as regards working with Parliament his conduct has been exemplary This bodes very well for the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union is not the product of constructivist rationalism, of enlightened tyrannical elites who impose themselves on the people. Rather, it arises from the very promising idea of working together. If there is one area where the European Union was in need of stimulus to integrate policies, broaden the area of cooperation, coordination and synergies, it is the area of research, development and technological innovation. Consequently, the European Research Area is one of the key concerns of the present College of Commissioners. Commissioner Busquin is to be credited with launching and developing such an ambitious idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Area does in fact introduce new and potentially very beneficial instruments. Examples of these are cooperation and coordination regarding the research policies of Member States, concentrating on a small number of promising priorities, exploiting to the full the concept of added European value, the notion of large scale projects and of networks of excellence. There is no doubt that if proper use were made of these instruments they would all play their part in improving the quality and competitiveness of our system of research, development and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our amendments arose out of a number of concerns. To give you some examples: to facilitate the movement of researchers, which we consider essential, to ensure openness and cross-fertilisation amongst the research systems of the Member States, to improve basic research and to establish clearly the criteria which will allow us to set priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Area creates new expectations and is a source of great hope for us all. We wish you success, Commissioner, because your success in this field will be Parliament’s success and the European Union’s success too. Rest assured: as you move forward along the route you have presented so enthusiastically, you will find us marching shoulder to shoulder with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, we wondered whether the Commission was taking on board the fact that strictly Community related research makes up only a small percentage of global research activity in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, after the first communication and, in particular, after this one, which defines the instruments more clearly, we know that we are definitely on the eve of a major change of course in research – although I would not go quite so far as to describe it as a Copernican revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the purpose of research and of its main instrument, the Framework Programme, has been to keep European industry competitive. Today, obviously without neglecting that fundamental objective, we feel that there is a higher ambition, a new dimension. It is clear that if we want to achieve this European Research Area, which corresponds to a genuine Community policy, cooperation with the Member States is absolutely essential. In that respect, I do not agree with Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, even though I find her report quite excellent. I think we must not be overcautious. The Heads of State knew what they were doing when they incorporated that form of cooperation into the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. We must make that cooperation strong and vigorous. I believe it is an essential element and one that must form the basis of the ideas and proposals in the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must embark resolutely on this cooperation, but without forgetting that, in itself, that will not be enough to create a European Research Area. We will have to invigorate the European Research Area by making new efforts to promote the mobility of the researchers, as Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca so rightly said. We must also invigorate it through joint efforts in the field of major infrastructure. We must also, of course, invigorate it by setting up networks of research centres, whether or not they are networks of excellence, but it is true that we have centres of excellence and they will have to get used to working together. Here you face a formidable choice, Commissioner, in regard to charting these centres of excellence. These days, one could no doubt call it a benchmarking exercise. To call it so is one thing, to make it so is, of course, another, more difficult thing. However, when all is said and done, we have confidence that you will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that over and above the European Research Area, which I believe will be a structural component of the next Framework Programme, we will also have to create links between the research areas and the whole field of university education. That is another dimension, but it is a crucial one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are grateful to him for that and I want to congratulate him personally, just as I want to congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel on the excellent report she has drawn up on the subject. Of course, we are in favour of this idea, and we would like to point out the aspects that the Group of the Verts/ALE considers most important.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must move towards closer European integration in research. We want national programmes to be more accessible at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Point two, this European Research Area must focus on sound basic research carried out by public establishments and it must be accompanied by a European innovation area that is geared to enterprises, be they large, small or medium-sized. At each step, we must try to create a real European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Three, we must also consider introducing new tools. It is clear that the Sixth Framework Programme we are beginning to work on is the most important one. We must renew it and make it more accessible, more flexible and more legible. We must look into the idea of integrated programmes, of networks of excellence, but, at the same time, we must not forget the smaller entities, which can act as sources of discovery and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Four, we are aware of the need to develop means of promoting exchanges, such as grants, to invest in young people and to create a balance, giving more time to research.</p>
<p class="contents">Five, we must continue to promote pure science. We would like to see more attention paid to the subject of sciences and society and more support given to the human and social sciences.</p>
<p class="contents">Six, the European Research Area must place more emphasis on sustainable development, by drawing up very concrete research projects, such as projects relating to the environment or to renewable energies. But we are not in favour of the inclusion of military research or research in the defence area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my seventh point, we are paying close attention to the international aspect, which is not just a question of competition with the United States or Japan and which must take account of the candidate countries and the cooperation programmes with the developing countries and the Euro-Mediterranean countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also a desire to make the EU a common scientific area, eventually to become a scientific superpower. In many fields the EU is already a scientific superpower. Not all the results and methods applied become common practice, however, as many large countries appear to have their eye purely on their own national, commercial and military interests. They should be opening up their projects to others more. If that does not happen, the EU will not be a genuine European Research Area, and EU money will be used to finance just the scraps and leftovers, for which there are insufficient national funds owing to the fact that the work is deemed to generally lack importance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Finland we use the expression ‘meaningless research’. That means research that produces results that no one needs, uses, criticises or adds to. The European Research Area must not become an area of meaningless research and EU money must not be spent on financing meaningless research. We have to solve the problem that there is no qualitative monitoring of the use of EU funds in which radically scientific achievements might be appraised. It is to be feared that the use of funds is inefficient in scientific terms. It is possible that a common research centre will mean more bureaucracy than science. For that reason, we must demand that any common research area must be developed according to scientific criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her thorough work in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. The report’s only flaw is its call for an alliance between science and the armaments industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination and cooperative arrangements are good, but there should be no anti-competitive assimilation. Subsidiarity defines the limits of the Community’s powers, and those limits must always be borne in mind. Whether the Commission’s ambitious projects are realised will depend on the breadth of vision demonstrated by national decision makers, who must rid themselves of the notion that the awarding of research contracts is a means of subsidising their own national economies. The foremost priority must be to achieve each research aim as quickly as possible for the benefit of the entire European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Union probably have the best training courses for scientists, but sadly they often emigrate to more attractive countries like the United States after obtaining their qualifications. Every effort must be made to keep them in Europe, which is why it is up to us to create the best possible conditions for research activity and thus to make Europe a more appealing option for top researchers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also say to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel that I congratulate her on her work, even though, as she knows, I regret the fact that, for reasons which I believe were often ideological, she rejected out of hand all the amendments I had tabled with the aim of improving the report. I want to tell her that I personally will be more generous than she was when we collectively draft the Sixth Framework Research Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With this document, the European Commission is, in effect, proposing guidelines for future measures to support research prior to the discussion on the Framework Programme for 2002­2006. Among these very interesting ideas, I want to take up one, which is and will be one of the leitmotifs of our debates. It is about the need to concentrate European research activity more closely on a limited series of priorities. The key concept here is that of European added value. I know it will not be easy to define these priorities, but I think European research will have everything to gain if we do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same context, the innovations that will mark the Sixth Framework Research Programme are the networks of excellence and the integrated projects, concepts that are also bound to give rise to wide debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission document also addresses the question of the mobility of students, researchers and scientists. That will be one of the central themes of the Sixth Framework Programme and I know that the Belgian Presidency intends to organise a conference on the subject. I welcome that. I am glad that the role of the SMEs has been acknowledged. I approve the call for the inclusion of the human and social sciences under the Sixth Framework Research Programme. It is vital to hold a debate on science and society now that we are at the beginning of the third millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report establish sound foundations for the major task on which we will be embarking together, on the basis of transparency, which also covers the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion.

The clear references to strengthening competitiveness, the proposal to compile a list of priorities, the recommendation on reducing the number of priorities in order to focus efforts on smaller research projects, the suffocating controls on every research activity will, if adopted by the Council and the Commission, result in a nightmarish structure which will smother research and researchers, wipe out any freedom in the search for new knowledge and radically change the nature of research as a process of producing new knowledge and as a productive force, especially in countries such as Greece, where nearly all research activity revolves around European funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, linking the European Research Area with security and defence policy, paragraph 28, will encourage the militarisation of research, a highly dangerous move. In addition, the reference to new Member States, paragraph 35, is clearly disparaging, given that most of them have a long history of research. I want to believe that Commissioner Busquin will have the sense to ignore most of the European Parliament's recommendation. Otherwise, as I said earlier, we shall have a nightmarish structure in the research area rather than a European Research Area. Needless to say, the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.</p>

I believe that Commissioner Busquin bears a heavier burden of responsibility than anyone else in Europe at the present time. The main objective in the context of the BSE crisis is to restore consumer confidence, which we can only achieve by means of objective research, by means of evidence from scientists that the foodstuffs we consume are absolutely safe. For that reason, I believe that the whole question of BSE, which covers biotechnological and genetic research, is an important and central issue. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I am even in favour of our making a special allocation without delay for BSE-related research, because I believe that research is the only truly important contribution that we can make to the clarification and solution of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, small and medium-sized businesses are one of my main areas of concern, and I can only endorse the rapporteur’s view that we should move from 10% to 15% and that funds should be earmarked for companies with fewer than 250 employees. I would also add, however, that provision should perhaps be made for a second threshold for cooperation between large and small companies, research establishments and university institutes. We should insist that the knowledge of large companies and the research findings of scientific foundations and institutions be passed on to the universities and recycled from there into the business world through incubators in order to create new jobs and new businesses. We know that the market is particularly keen on small and medium-sized businesses that are innovative and produce highly marketable products. We should, however, work hard to shift responsibility for the achievement of the aforementioned aims to the national level, because another aspect of the research guidelines is, of course, the idea of dividing up large projects and making them accessible to small businesses too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also find the term ‘research area’ very effective. I believe this is a good initiative from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a word or two on Mr Alyssandrakis’ remarks, which invite the comment that, if Greece spent more money on research, it would be less dependent on Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is the problem for many countries in the European Union. They have cut back on their research funding for both large and small projects. European research cannot fill this gap. If we want to have a European Research Area, the EU and the Member States must both play their part, otherwise we shall be faced with an imbalance that we cannot redress.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see the administration of these research projects as a major challenge, especially when we enlarge the European Union. Brussels will not be able to go on administering them in the long run. That is why we should try, perhaps with the budgetary control apparatus, with the Court of Auditors, to develop procedures that will lighten the administrative burden in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the research effort cannot be governed by the principles of prudent accounting. Research means taking risks, and some of these risks will inevitably be financial. The crux of all research activity is the final outcome. The bottom line is the result of the research and not necessarily the financial balance. I should far rather have a successful project on which some losses might have been sustained than a project with a perfect balance sheet but no useful findings.</p>

The unanimity of our general aims, however, does not make them any easier to achieve in practice. The foundations of future research policy are, in our view, concentration of effort, in other words prioritisation, as well as flexibility and coordination. These must necessarily be accompanied by democratic decisions taken by a heterogeneous Parliament and an equally heterogeneous Council. I must be honest with you, Commissioner: if this initiative succeeds, you will deserve our warmest congratulations. We shall try to assist you in your efforts. The European Research Area is certainly a first step in the right direction and will be a component of the Sixth Framework Programme. However, as soon as it comes to putting the theory into practice, questions inevitably start to arise. The devil is not only in the detail. To put it another way, you want a concentrated effort, and indeed we all want to have priorities. So what clearly defined criteria will you be using to set these priorities, Commissioner? All I can say is ‘Have fun!’</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria have never been defined in the proper degree of detail, and both of us, Mr Caudron, have been using the term ‘European added value’ for the past ten years. Is that not so? Neither of us has ever defined what it means, nor have we ever been able to. Enough has already been said about flexibility, but then comes the third point, namely coordination. A European Research Area necessarily involves coordination between the Union level and national research, and here I see party-political differences rearing their heads. How much do we want to coordinate centrally, how much do we want to plan and specify centrally, and how much should be done from below in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity? It will be an absorbing debate, and the political parties are already fuelling it, but we are ready and willing to engage in that debate. Congratulations to the rapporteur – we shall continue our cooperation.</p>

Similarly I would like to thank the Commissioner for a very thorough presentation. These days information is the most important factor in production and what we are calling for is an improvement to the content of processed information. It is in this way different, therefore, from plain information. Technical innovation and technical lead are slowly receding into the background as the importance of content and the content industry is being stressed more and more. We are moving away from a sort of information society hopefully to one of education, culture and values, and these guidelines really do speak of a European Research Area. That, in my opinion, is only right, and they say it will be a way of revising the basic social structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation being as it is, I will make two proposals. As a result of the change already under way, we should create a cluster of projects within the framework of the European Research Area, which would help develop content and the production of content. Europe would have much to do in such a project. Another cluster would be one that revised basic social structures; namely, the globalisation of commerce and communication. This is a major factor in the changes taking place today and an enormous challenge in terms of research. For that we would need a study undertaken, as it affects us all. We need information because commerce and communication have taken the place of politics, measured globally. For that reason, Commissioner, I would hope that the proportion of social research can be increased. Finally, I would like to ask what you intend to do to allow research into globalisation to strengthen and grow and give us politicians more weapons to use in debating this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to fill in an important piece of detail within the framework. The oft-recited Lisbon Summit sets the overall objective of "making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world". The biotechnology industry can make a major contribution to achieving this ambition. It is therefore vital that research in the life sciences is given the highest priority in the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there is much despondency, even despair in certain areas of research. We are seeing moratoria on crop trials and new product approvals; deliberate damage to trial crops; delays in transposing essential legislation; verbal and even physical attacks on healthcare researchers; environmental scare-stories that are unfounded and unsubstantiated; harassment of researchers – even threats to life by animal liberation extremists; and the use of emotive and inaccurate terms such as "Frankenstein foods" by antagonistic spokesmen and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">All these pressures, often exacerbated by weak responses by governments and public bodies, are threatening our ability in Europe to realise the great potential which biotechnology offers us. Certainly, a reasonable level of regulation is necessary but this must be directed towards encouraging rather than discouraging advances. Only within such a positive environment will it be possible to realise this potential and be competitive in the industries of the future, in the agriculture of the future, in the highest standards of healthcare, in our contribution to third world development and the elimination of starvation and disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also say how encouraging I find my relationship with all the Members who are deeply concerned with this issue. They have offered me their contributions, their experience and their advice on how to construct this European Research Area, which, I believe, is widely recognised as an essential political objective for Europe. I would also like to thank Mrs Fraisse and Mrs McNally, representing the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities respectively, for their contributions. Clearly, Parliament's support for this European Research Area is essential if we are to make headway with this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of establishing a European Research Area was accepted at the Lisbon Summit. It has become a political fact. But it is true that much remains to be done to make it a reality, as you have made abundantly clear; in that regard Parliament's proposals are an essential component for creating a dynamic at European level. Let me add that, at the forthcoming Stockholm Summit, we will have a progress report on this concept of a European Research Area. The issue is also on the agenda of the Heads of State and Government who are meeting in Stockholm, where it is one of the aspects to be considered precisely in relation to the objective of creating a dynamic European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few comments on the various points raised in Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report and Members' statements. Of course, I broadly agree with what was said, but perhaps I can be a little more specific on some aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the European Research Area will be created thanks, on the one hand, to the Framework Programme, which is designed to facilitate it, but thanks mainly to open coordination between the Member States and those involved in research. So, if the Framework Programme is an instrument, it will have to be adjusted so that it can help structure the European Research Area. That is what you will find in the new Framework Programme: elements contributing greatly to structuring a European Research Area. Indeed, the five-year evaluation report highlighted the need for this measure and made it very clear that the Framework Programme needed to be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of open coordination, I agree that our role still needs to be defined and the criteria need to be more clearly adjusted. But our role is to facilitate and promote open coordination between the Member States. We must consider how we propose to achieve this. Clearly, therefore, this will be a long-term job, a job that will require partnership between the Commission and the Member States, with support from the European Parliament and support, Mr Alyssandrakis, from the entire scientific community. It is indeed a project that concerns all European scientists. There is no distinction. There are, of course, elements of subsidiarity; there is research that is carried out in the Member States and there is added value research. So we are still far away, light years away, in fact, from the kind of monopoly to which you referred and which is certainly not what any of the Members of this Parliament have in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, we will have to adapt new intervention formulae and, in this context, some speakers, including Mrs Fraisse and Mr Desama, referred to the question of the link with education. This science-education link is very relevant and it will, in fact, be on the agenda of the meeting of Ministers for Education and Science in Upsala. We will be holding a joint meeting between Ministers for Education and Science, an informal Council, in Sweden on 2 and 3 March, on the subject of science, society and education in the sciences; we will also be holding an initial discussion between Ministers for Research on the future Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the new instruments I welcome your support, and Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca highlighted the importance of these new instruments very clearly. It is in fact thanks to them that we will be able to act more effectively while also, as Mr Linkohr said, simplifying the management procedures, and therefore avoid duplication. So that is the spirit in which the instruments proposed by the Commission were defined. But I also understand your concern about the need to ensure that these instruments offer equal opportunities for all. They must not look as though they were reserved for one category or another, for one group or another or tailored to any particular group or category. So it is in that spirit that we will need to define the new instruments more precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">On the networks of excellence, I think it is quite clear that this is a crucial point, but I am also aware that we have to agree on the definition of networks with a capacity for excellence. In fact, we should use that term rather than referring to 'giant' centres. These are not 'giant' centres of excellence. They are networks with a capacity for excellence, depending on the subject and field of research. So the objective is to establish virtual centres of excellence that incorporate the capacity for excellence in the priority areas. It follows that this is certainly not intended to be a tool, amongst other things, for the small and medium-sized enterprises and the countries that are least developed in terms of research. There are centres of excellence in all the European countries, based on the criteria, which we will be discussing, of the European added value of the programme. That is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in passing that Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel was quite right in what she said about infrastructure. As you know, we have already tried to establish an infrastructure with the GEANT programme and to reconcile the infrastructures of all the European countries, with the aim of attaining a capacity of 10 gigabits. But, as she pointed out, we will have to achieve 100 gigabits, so the infrastructure programme will give priority to encouraging coordination between the Member States, since they have to make the effort on their own territory. We will be discussing that priority when we come to the new Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Variable geometry, or what has been called improved cooperation, is evidently one of the issues that raises questions, since Article 169 of the Treaty provides for it but it has never been implemented until now. That is why a very major debate is being held on this issue, which concerns efficiency but is also an institutional matter. We therefore believe that it is up to the Member States to take the initiative. We can only make proposals on the participation of the Union if we have real participation by the Member States. But I agree that we must ensure that this instrument does not discriminate against certain Member States and that Parliament is fully involved in the major decision making in this field. We will have an opportunity to discuss this in greater detail when we come to consider the proposal for the Framework Programme. It will be a major theme of that discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on priorities and criteria, I believe we have outlined the general criteria to illustrate the priorities set out on an indicative basis. These criteria draw on the replies we received in a wide-ranging opinion poll of all those involved in research, which we ran on the Internet throughout the year 2000. We consulted a wide range of scientific and industrial groups on these questions via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This showed that there are clearly three major subjects that are guaranteed to produce added value. They are: everything concerned with post-genome research; the information society, together with the cost of the Internet, which is an essential factor of democratisation; and the question of the nano-technologies and advanced materials and processes.</p>
<p class="contents">These are three important subjects, without forgetting questions of food safety, which is, of course, very much on our minds in Europe today, the quality of life and sustainable development. These will indeed be discussed in the communication the Commission intends to draft in preparation for the Gothenburg Summit. It will discuss sustainable development as one of the key lines of research in the field of the environment, energy and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">On SMEs, Members are clearly right to emphasise their importance. Initially, it was said that at least 10% of the appropriations under the Fifth Framework Programme should be allocated to the SMEs. It seems we are now moving towards a more ambitious target and we might be able to argue for 15% in the next Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now tell Mr Caudron that European added value is clearly the key component. How should we define it? I think it should be defined according to the research projects in question. The concept of European added value is not a global one. It is defined according to the subject of the research, which must be carried out at least at European level if it is to match up to world competition.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of nuclear research, I have no objection, quite the contrary in fact, to Parliament being widely involved in the discussion. You referred to the meeting on nuclear fusion. Let me point out that it was in no way a formal meeting but simply a question and answer session on a document, which is, in fact, accessible and which sets out the four possible options in regard to fusion. I think we cannot avoid a debate on this question. Indeed, it has already been discussed in earlier debates on the previous Framework Programmes. I, personally, am in favour of an open debate on this subject, because it is a fundamental social issue, an entirely legitimate question.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and society, young people and society: that is clearly the subject of the follow-up activities of the Helsinki Group we set up to look at the position of women in the sciences, both in the public and private sectors. Clearly there is also the question of international cooperation. There is that international dimension: the role that Europe plays in the world in relation to research and to serious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and so forth. We have drafted a communication on development with my colleague Mr Nielson, which will be on the Commission's agenda next week. The international dimension must always form part of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I have spoken at great length, but this was an opportunity for me to spark off some debate on the forthcoming Framework Programme, which will probably be adopted in the next few weeks, or even next week. That would allow me to come and present the broad outlines of the new Framework Programme in about a fortnight's time, as a follow-up to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's report. Let me close by once again thanking her and all the Members for their contributions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κorakas (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the cotton sector is of great social and economic importance, as you know, to Spain and, even more so, to Greece. In Greece, cotton is becoming a national product, employing over 300 000 families and producing about 1 350 000 tonnes of cotton in Objective 1 areas, which have a far higher unemployment rate than the Community average and where the average size of holdings is much smaller than the Community average. The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton. In other words, this product is in particularly short supply in the European Union, with Community production covering a mere 35% of demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Guaranteed national quantities are always irritatingly lower than actual production, which has resulted in producers' incomes being eroded by high coresponsibility levies while, paradoxically, the bigger the quota overshoot, the lower the cost to the Community budget. This unacceptable situation has justifiably exasperated our producers, who are turning out in force, just as they did years ago and again yesterday throughout the countryside in Greece. However, instead of strengthening the current regulation, as rightly demanded by our cotton growers, by bringing quotas into line with current production levels and adjusting at least some of the institutional prices, which have been frozen since 1992, along comes the European Commission and not only does it propose to keep support at its current low levels, it increases the coresponsibility levy by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's objective of drastically reducing cotton production is unjustified because this is a product in which the European Union is only 30-35% self-sufficient. It is wrong because it penalises cotton producers for the fall in international cotton prices over the last three years – despite the fact that they are not to blame and the Commission did nothing to rectify the situation. I should point out here that the European Commission tried to back up its unacceptable proposal by presenting it when international prices were at their lowest for a decade, in December 1999. Since then, international prices have doubled. Similarly, the European Union is proposing to limit aid for cotton production when it is most needed, with the United States of America channelling more and more money to its cotton producers, enabling them to increase their output and depressing international prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental alibi does not stand up because cotton production – and this has been scientifically proven – is much less harmful to the environment than similar types of subsidised production which producers abandoned in order to grow cotton. The Commission has not taken any account whatsoever of Protocol 4 to the Act of Accession of Greece, which sets out the scheme for cotton with a view to aiding cotton production in the regions of the Community in which it is important to the agricultural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Cotton producers are calling for the Community preference to be extended to cotton, especially given the shortfall in the Community in cotton. Cotton is the chief plant-based textile fibre which is a natural and healthier product than the synthetic fibres with which it competes, it provides jobs for hundreds of thousands of farmers and it may even attract young farmers to remain in the countryside, which is being depopulated.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we propose? We propose to lift all restrictions on cotton growing, quotas, coresponsibility levies, environmental consequences, so that the minimum price is paid in full to producers. Despite this, since for a variety of financial reasons some ceiling has to be set, this ceiling should cover present actual production by our cotton growers, the system of aid should be maintained, institutional prices of cotton should be adjusted in the light of official data concerning average Community inflation between 1995 and 2000, aid should be paid directly to cotton producers through their cooperative associations, without the intervention of private ginning undertakings, after studying the most suitable procedure, and Annex B of the regulation, which determines increases and reductions in the minimum producer price on the basis of quality characteristics, should be included in the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that it is essential for the European Parliament to support the producers' call for aid. It is in precisely this spirit that we proposed a quota of 1.5 million tonnes for Greece and 450 000 tonnes for Spain. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided on 1 200 000 for Greece and 350 000 for Spain. We want to call on Parliament to stand by the side of farmers so that people stay in the countryside and so that, at the end of the day, our farmers can survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, only 42% of demand was met between 1995 and 1999. Moreover it is also the case that, as Mr Korakas, whom I would like to congratulate on his report, has rightly stated, this is a crop grown in the most disadvantaged regions of Spain and Greece. The production of cotton is very labour-intensive. This means that it is essential to maintain cotton production in order to preserve the social and economic fabric of these areas. It is also the reason for the two most important requests made by Parliament: that the overshoot penalty percentage should not be increased from 50% to 60%, and that the maximum guaranteed quantities be brought into line with actual production levels. I am only advocating an approximation, not an equalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission drew up its proposal, it was alarmed by unduly low world prices, which had reached a ten-year low. As a result the cost of aid had risen, due to the system of aid for cotton. Circumstances have now changed, Commissioner: prices have risen to almost record levels, the money allocated to paying farmers has been reduced and the proposal for a regulation can no longer be justified. However, the amendments adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development certainly are justified. An increase in penalties would put many of the smallest holdings out of business, with all the social problems that this would entail. The current imbalance between actual production levels and the maximum guaranteed quantities is the reason for the huge penalties borne by farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Korakas has rightly said, we could also invoke Protocol 4 of the Act of Accession of Greece, which calls for cotton production to be maintained in those areas where it is considered important to the agricultural economy. It also states that farmers are entitled to a fair income. This would improve the agricultural infrastructure and so stabilise the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture trusts that the amendments it has put forward will stimulate the implementation of collective environmental measures, through the sector’s producers’ associations, which we aim to promote and support.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Commission will take account of these arguments and amendments, and agree to amend the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank him very much for being open to dialogue and to all manner of proposals, right from the start. He has been very willing to listen. Together with the work carried out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development this has resulted in a splendid European Parliament report.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission adopts the amendments put forward in Mr Korakas’ report, the result will be a much improved cotton system. The improvements will include adjustment of the guaranteed national quantities, the aid system, and the establishment of a new permanent framework recognising producers’ associations. Moreover, the amendments tabled by Parliament encourage the implementation of more environmentally-friendly measures which will save water, reduce the use of pesticides, and provide for appropriate management of plastic waste materials.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion the Commission’s proposal is too minimalist. It is concerned solely with saving money and is incompatible with what is supposed to be the European Union’s top priority: protecting jobs. This is because insufficient account is taken of job preservation or creation when choosing between the options available.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore urge you to vote for and support Amendment No 20, tabled by Mr Garot and myself on behalf of the Socialist Group. This amendment makes a significant proposal. We ask Member States to take employment into account when adopting measures to change the criteria for land eligible for aid. In making such decisions, account should be taken of the number of jobs dependent on these areas. We also propose that alternative crops and the existence of other options be investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, this is all about social and economic sensitivity. I trust that our amendment will be supported, and would like to congratulate the speaker once again on his magnificent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It reveals the anxiety affecting this important sector of European agriculture and, more particularly, significant areas of Greece and Andalusia, the main producer regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Cotton is a traditional crop which provides a livelihood for thousands of European families for whom there is hardly any alternative source of income. There is a significant cotton shortfall in the European Union; we can only meet 40% of demand, and it remains the best natural fibre for fabric production, when compared to synthetic fibres. Furthermore, cotton has replaced other intensive crops which generate more pollution and greater surpluses. However, despite the improvements, it is true that there are still environmental problems we need to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we support the Commission’s proposal of maintaining the present system of production aid, based on the compensation payments system. However, we do not believe that imposing stiffer penalties is the right way to restrict expenditure on this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simplistic to talk of containing spending and only to present budgetary considerations for reforming the aid system, when what is really happening is that farmers’ incomes are falling whilst we are witnessing an increase in imports from outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This constitutes a structural change, since expenditure has been determined principally by changes to international prices, not by an actual increase in the area of land under cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">Stiffer penalties will doubtless lead to greater concentration of the sector. It will pass into the hands of a few individuals and the viability of family farms will be seriously threatened. However, cotton growing will not cease, which is the intention.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the producers’ organisations are the best means of improving the effectiveness of the necessary self-regulation measures concerning production and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to stress that the Commission must gradually recognise the actual production in these areas. It should adjust guaranteed national quantities, bringing them into line with actual production of cotton, a product we do not produce enough of in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One year on, world market prices have risen by 90%. The risk of excessive costs no longer exists. In fact, costs are now minimal. We therefore have to ask ourselves why the Commission has not withdrawn this proposal which no longer has a <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">It is two years since China decided to export its stockpiled cotton causing a record drop in world prices. I hope that the Commission does not attempt to maintain a proposal on the cotton system exploiting a decision by the Chinese Government, a decision which had no lasting effects.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission simply wishes to cut production aid crucial for the most disadvantaged regions of the European Union, it would be better if it said so clearly. As part of an increasingly unbalanced common agricultural policy, the effects of these proposals, including the social effects, are wholly negative as earlier speakers explained.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the merit of Mr Korakas’ report is that it corrects the Commission’s proposal. It also makes other very useful suggestions on effecting adjustment whilst taking account of some of the peculiarities of cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it proposes adjusting the national guaranteed quantities in line with actual production. This will put and end to the anomalies of the aid system, in which costs increase as production decreases.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – I must not be side-tracked by other matters – Mr Korakas’ report outlines a scheme for supporting producers’ organisations, and most importantly, a system to implement measures reducing the impact of cotton cultivation on the environment. The Commission dwells on the possible environmental problems of growing cotton, but fails to suggest solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Commissioner, that when finalising the legislative procedure, the Commission and the Council will include the amendments unanimously approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as previous speakers have requested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So when we examine cotton growing, we must bear these two factors in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point worth noting in the case of the subject at issue is the fact that Community cotton production falls far below its actual requirements, barely covering around 35% of demand. Plus, European cotton growers are small and medium-sized farmers with an average of 4.2 hectares each, at least they are in Greece. Production, therefore, is determined by the small size of the holdings and the soil conditions which meet the specifications for this crop.</p>
<p class="contents">These objective conditions have brought about a situation over the years which, at production level, is as follows: average annual volume of cotton produced: 1 200 000 tonnes in Greece and 350 000 tonnes in Spain. The report finds a way round this in a compromise proposal – a judicious, moderate, perfectly realistic proposal – calling on the Commission to recognise this state of affairs by introducing national guaranteed quantities of unginned cotton of 1 200 000 tonnes for Greece, 350 000 tonnes for Spain and 1 500 tonnes for each of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this responsible and realistic approach in the report should be accepted by the Commission as it stands and strengthened in the forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Aid per hectare for cotton is three to four times higher than for other crops; that certainly has to be considered whenever this whole issue is discussed. In the view of the Commission, this special effort by the Community, in particular the extra financial input, is only warranted by the economic and, more importantly, the social significance attached to cotton in some regions of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few years, however, the area of land that is planted with cotton has increased considerably, and yields per hectare have also risen sharply. This poses new risks, both to the budget and to the environment, for we must not forget that cotton planting is a very intensive form of crop farming and involves the highly concentrated use of fertilisers and pesticides. The main aim of the Commission’s proposal, therefore, is to ensure that an excessive increase in production levels is accompanied by an accelerated reduction of the minimum price levels we set.</p>
<p class="contents">Adoption of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, however, would lead to a substantial increase in the size of the budget for cotton production. This, in turn, would mean an increase rather than a decrease in production incentives, which would also tend to undermine the environmental safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">To make it clear what is at stake here, let me tell you that, even if we assume stable yields and an average market price, the additional cost of the committee’s amendments would be in the order of EUR 650 million a year. This corresponds to an 85% increase in the budget. In view of the current budgetary situation, I certainly could not comply with such a request.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the individual amendments, Nos 1, 3, 4 and 9 to 13 seek to increase prices by 10% and the national guaranteed quantities by 50%. Apart from sending costs soaring, these measures could lead to a 60% increase in production, amounting to an additional output of 900 000 tonnes, with the consequences I have just described. Amendments Nos 5 and 14 propose that the minimum price be indexed on the basis of the quality of unginned cotton; the price scale would be adopted by the Member States if the relevant professional organisations could not reach agreement on a price scale.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had some apposite experience of such ideas in the past. It emerged very clearly that it is simply impossible to establish and administer such a system centrally, because there are quite simply far too many factors that influence the quality of raw cotton. For that reason, we must stand by our view that this question should continue to be decided by the interested parties, in other words, between the purchasers and suppliers of raw cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, propose the introduction of a criterion, namely conformity with the weighted average of world market prices for cotton fibres. This will give us a framework that will make it easier to negotiate future agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 16 to 19 relate to rules governing the formulation of official statutes by cotton producers’ organisations and specifying the activities of such organisations for which Community aid is payable. This is intended to apply to environmental measures in particular. I must draw your attention to the fact that such a regime already exists and is set forth in Regulation (EEC) No 389/1982. Moreover, the creation of producers’ organisations has been financed by the Community for the past ten years. As is customary in other sectors, these bodies are expected to meet their running costs from the funds allocated to the common organisation of the market and from environmental aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept these amendments, because they would mean the existence of two different sets of rules for producers’ organisations as well as two different funding systems. If we also take account of the increased production that would result from the requested rise in the national guaranteed quantities, this alone could entail annual costs in the region of EUR 80 million. As far as the environment is concerned, Amendments Nos 6, 15 and 20 seek wide scope for the Member States to amend the common organisation of the market, not only on the basis of environmental considerations but also, and above all, for economic and social reasons. This is really unacceptable because it puts the very existence of the environmental safeguards in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">So there remains Amendment No 2, which is essentially intended to correct a mistake in the Spanish text. But, in point of fact, neither a translation problem nor an error has occurred here, because the expression <span class="italic">precio de objetivo</span> is meant to refer to the target price, not to the actual market price.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that, on this occasion, the Commission cannot accept the committee’s amendments, but I trust I have fully explained the reasons for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Izquierdo Rojo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this proposal concerns fruits in shells or pods: that is, nuts and locust beans. We are therefore dealing with walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios and chestnuts. These products are generally found alongside other fruits on the table and in supermarkets. However, when it comes to decision making, they are not treated fairly and reasonably in relation to other fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this proposal, the European Parliament is being consistent with itself. On two previous occasions, 16 June 2000 and 26 October 2000, Parliament already came out in favour of maintaining support and proposing an extension until the introduction of a new aid system. On both these occasions the vote was carried by unanimity. Furthermore, in my view, Mr President, this aid is justified because it benefits the agricultural workers who need it as it helps to compensate for a reduction in their income. I do believe that granting over-generous aid in favourable market situations should be avoided. Cereals are a case in point. Both the Commission and the Court of Auditors have stressed that undue compensation was awarded. In fact, in the period between 1993 and 1997, the Commission estimates that excess compensation worth EUR 8 500 million was granted to the cereal sector. The Court of Auditors puts the figure for excess compensation awarded at EUR 13 100 million. I am not in favour of granting aid as if it were a lottery. The aid we are proposing now really is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this proposal is in line with the provisions in Agenda 2000. When the latter was adopted Commissioner Fischler himself stated repeatedly that the intention was to maintain all aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council agreed with the European Parliament’s position. Hence, on 17 July 2000, it invited the Commission to extend the aid. The Commission’s proposal is on the right lines, because it redresses the earlier error of attempting to cut off aid. It is right to do so. However, that alone is not enough to ensure a future for the sector. It does not even cover the cost of projects under way this year. The budget has to be ready in June, and programmes relating to plantations in the first part of this year would not be included.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious shortage of these products within the European Union. Walnuts are imported from the United States. I have to tell you, Commissioner, that last Christmas, <span class="italic">El Corte</span> <span class="italic">Inglés</span>, a major department store in my country, strongly promoted Californian walnuts, but walnuts from Extremadura and other European walnuts were sidelined. We import products of this nature to the detriment of the agricultural workers I am speaking for.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you ought to be taking note of what I am saying because this constitutes a precedent. We are in favour of opening up markets and coming to multilateral agreements and to bilateral agreements, with Turkey for instance. We are happy to show solidarity. Nevertheless, the Commission cannot condone European agriculture abandoning these crops as a result of commercial agreements which have caused the collapse of such an important sector. Will the Commission allow European aid to the agricultural sector to be cut off? And does this mean that European agriculture will no longer receive preferential treatment?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I speak for a sector which diversifies agriculture and which truly has great potential for economic development. Mr Fischler is not well acquainted with the Mediterranean area. He ought however to make it his business to become acquainted with the benefits of this sector. It is important for the processing industry, has a most favourable impact on the environment and arrests desertification. Commissioner, I call on you to amend your position and come into line with the spirit of the Council’s agreement.</p>

<p class="contents">Our group’s position is that we support Mrs Izquierdo Rojo’s report whilst also congratulating the Commission insofar as it is simplifying the procedure. It is important to note that simplification. Simplification is often heralded but rarely achieved. I think something will be achieved this time, because a need which has been mentioned in Parliament on numerous occasions, adopted almost unanimously and accepted by the Council has been recognised. For example, the resolutions dated 16 June and 26 October are in that spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now proposing that the improvement plans be extended. We do not merely wish them to be extended for one year only. Instead, we would like the amendments unanimously adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development requesting a two-year extension taken into account. We trust the Commission and the Commissioner will be sensitive to these proposals. They are necessary and the Commissioner is perfectly well aware that a year is not long enough to assess the report on the future evolution of the COM in fruit he is due to submit. Nor is it long enough to find a permanent solution for the shell and pod fruit sector, which will have to become part of the fruit and vegetable sector under special conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that all this will prove costly, and that current funding for this major problem is inadequate. However, we cannot allow sectors which are so important to their regions to be written off as a result of agreements signed earlier. Community preference arrangements in those agreements made it hard for the sector to survive, not to mention a whole range of points already made concerning its environmental and social significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s resolution of 16 June contains an ongoing appeal for the search for a solution which will provide for direct support for farmers’ income to be awarded, enabling production to continue and preventing the depopulation of very underprivileged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight how these crops contribute to environmental conservation in the most desertified areas of the Union. This is true of almonds and hazelnuts, for example. As for chestnuts, they are produced in indigenous Community forests, which are preserved for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore called upon to put forward proposals offering clear support to the sector. A flat rate of aid per hectare to be administered by producers’ organisations should be introduced and the structural crisis in the sector should be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the present arrangements should be extended until the introduction of permanent support measures for these products. They are of regional importance, offer a high level of food safety, are a source of energy in the Mediterranean diet and make a valuable contribution to safeguarding the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only specific aid from which they have benefited in the past and from which they benefit today is limited to cofinancing under plans to improve quality and marketing which expired at the end of last year and which the Commission is now proposing to extend by another year.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission proposal has come about as a result of the acknowledgement, as made by the Commission itself in the preamble to its proposal, that other measures, for which the sector is also eligible, have not been sufficient or directly applicable to nuts. The Commission therefore promised to present new proposals in a report that it would publish by the end of 2000, which it has still not done.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense to extend the already scarce measures in place by another year and to say nothing else about the future of this sector, still less so in that the sector is undergoing a particular crisis due to the extremely strong competition from third countries. What would make sense is for nuts to be treated as a separate sector within the Common Organisation of the Markets in fruits and vegetables. This was why, as a matter of fact, at the time of the proposal on the new COM in fruits and vegetables, the European Parliament adopted an amendment requesting the Commission to present proposals that would provide the nut sector with permanent measures and aid of the kind that exist for other agricultural sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the rapporteur is proposing and this is what we hope the Commission will put right. In the short term, until these future measures materialise, the most prudent course of action to adopt would be to extend existing aid not by one year but by two, as the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I deal with these, allow me to say a few brief words on the basic principles that underlie our proposal. The present regime for nuts and locust beans has been in place for ten years, and the first quality-improvement plans expired in the year 2000. During this ten-year period, 92 producers’ organisations have been awarded a total of EUR 750 million in Community funding to improve the production and marketing of nuts and locust beans.</p>
<p class="contents">Successful restructuring has indeed been effected in some cases, and producers have become more competitive. As a result, they are generally in a stronger position than they used to be when it comes to securing markets for their goods and competing successfully with suppliers from countries outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">An amount of EUR 250 million is earmarked once again for the agreements and measures that are still in force. The Commission believes that the ten-year plan has, in principle, adequately achieved the goal that was set ten years ago, namely the creation of a stable basis for economically viable producer organisations. The Council, however, asked the Commission to propose the continuation of the payments to nut and locust bean producers in the 2001 financial year. This was the basis on which the Commission drew up its proposal. Your amendments show that this proposal does not go far enough for your liking. The amendments, some of which refer to resolutions adopted by the European Parliament in June and October of last year, chiefly relate to three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One group of amendments, comprising Nos 14, 15, 17 and 20, seeks to maintain the aid for quality and marketing-improvement plans beyond the year 2001 and to treat as eligible expenditure all money spent on work that is carried out by the end of 2002. Amendments Nos 10 and 11 refer to the modest level of funds required for this purpose. The purpose of the second group of amendments, comprising Nos 8 and 18, is to maintain the special aid for hazelnuts through to the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Both groups of amendments are at least partly motivated by a perceived need to protect EU producers from imports. As far as these amendments are concerned, let me make the following points: firstly, the framework of this proposal is confined to the funding of programmes under the budget for 2001. It was never meant to be extended to the 2002 financial year, because that would entail additional costs amounting to EUR 82 million. Secondly, specific aid for hazelnuts is not covered by the proposal. Its inclusion would generate a further EUR 110 million in additional budgetary expenditure over and above the cost of the present proposal, which is assessed at EUR 24 million. Amendment No 16, which deals with chestnuts, does not fall within the scope of the regime we are debating here.</p>
<p class="contents">The third group of amendments, comprising Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 21 and 22, are designed to secure the long-term future of nut and locust bean production by means of other support measures. In addition, Amendments Nos 9 and 19 propose the continuation of support within the framework of the Common Organisation of the Market and of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. With regard to this third group, allow me to tell you how the Commission sees the future of this area of economic activity and the support it should receive. If we consider the present situation with regard to the production of nuts and locust beans, we see, on the one hand, economically viable and very definitely competitive producer organisations, which are, in a manner of speaking, the Union’s flagship producers. It is they who grow new varieties and who use modern production and marketing methods. These producers have made good use of the money we have provided over the past ten years and a number of them will surely also be able to benefit from the extension that is under discussion today. On the other hand, unfortunately, there are also producers and producer organisations that have to operate in extremely difficult conditions – in disadvantaged areas, for instance, many of which are in remote mountainous regions – with no irrigation facilities. In these areas there are literally thousands of families who remain partly or totally dependent on nut and/or locust bean production for their livelihood.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of the natural disadvantages that their geographical location imposes on all of these producers, they will always find it difficult to compete with importers from countries outside the EU. For this reason, we believe it makes far more sense – and this, indeed, is one of the aims we set ourselves in 1999 – to support this latter group of producers, whose problems are primarily of a social nature, in the framework of rural development. That is why we built this second pillar of the common agricultural policy, and so it is right to make use of it in this context. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, responsibility for rural development has also been shifted to the Member States, which must include measures of this type in their programmes and accord them due priority. Having done so, the Member States are then free to decide on the precise nature of their rural development projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not agree that Articles 42 and 308 constitute the legal basis for allowing third-country citizens to be covered under Regulation 1408, but think that Article 63, subsection 4 should do so. We cannot support the attempt to bend the Treaty in this way when there is an adequate legal basis elsewhere in the Treaty, just because a few other procedural regulations concerning the involvement of the European Parliament are at issue. If another legal basis is required, the Treaty must, in our view, be altered. We should like to emphasise that we support a general reform of Regulation 1408. However, we believe that a reform of this kind would be made more difficult if its scope were to be extended to include more people.

Furthermore, in the second instance, they have been rejected by Parliament, thanks, in part, to my vote, and that of the MPF Members, against. Our vote against should be taken to mean, of course, that we reject the amendments, but we do actually endorse the original French initiative and would like to see it acted upon. The vote of the European Parliament on this matter was, in fact, merely consultative, pursuant to Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the amendments initially adopted by the European Parliament particularly regrettable. A good number of them, as I explained in the course of last night’s debate, would have the effect of putting the definition of measures against illegal immigration off until the Greek Calends on the grounds that a whole host of other policies in all sorts of areas would have to be implemented first. This was a completely erroneous position, but I shall not harp on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a second category of amendments which tried to reduce the force of the text by exempting various categories of offender from punishment, for example, the illegal immigrants themselves or the persons assisting them on putatively humanitarian grounds. Such exceptions were completely inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, these “humanitarian” smugglers must not be exempted from prosecution. Firstly, because all the mafia groups smuggling people into countries illegally in return for payment would then claim humanitarian reasons. Secondly, because even the illegal immigrants that have been assisted by charitably minded people almost inevitably wind up in exploitative situations, as often as not, purely by dint of their illegal status. And finally because the possibly genuinely disinterested persons who assist illegal immigrants are probably doing the immigrants themselves no good but are certainly doing their fellow citizens no good by presenting them with a problem which will be practically impossible to resolve for generations to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the perpetrators of this infamy, it is not just a matter of terminology, as the police force of the Socialist Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, has just forcibly expelled illegal immigrants that had take refuge in the Parisian church of Saint Bernard in precisely the same way that his right-wing predecessor, Juppé, had people deported from the same place four years previously.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the causes driving hundreds of thousands of poor people out of their country of origin in order to attempt to survive elsewhere, the European Union has nothing but fine words. In order to put an end to poverty in these countries, the European institutions would have to take on the plunderers and exploiters of these countries. Since they are unable to cure the illness, they opt to penalise the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">While the French Presidency announces a Europe-wide witch-hunt against these “victims of oppression”, it points the finger at the squalid modern day slave traders, but only does so in order to cast a veil over the parties for whom the smugglers are recruiting, i.e. big business, construction giants and any number of smaller scale employers who thereby benefit from an immigrant workforce provided, at the discretion of employers and the police, by laws which do not grant them even minimal protection.</p>

I have voted against the report and against many of the amendments submitted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs. In view of the sensitivity of the subject, assistance with illegal immigration, a subject that always triggers intense emotions, I wish to explain my motives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say at the outset that I fully support the reception of recognised refugees as defined in the meeting in Geneva. The latter should be received in all Member States and granted asylum. Unfortunately, the general use of the word refugee for all those who seek sanctuary in the Union creates confusion in this report. What is an illegal refugee? If that person applies for asylum on entry he is not illegal. The terms foreigners, refugees, illegal immigrants, asylum seekers and suchlike are used in an inconsistent way. Such a careless use of terms does not belong in a legal text, in which, moreover, definitions have to be laid down and the framework of criminal law agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that deported asylum seekers often find themselves in a distressing position. Humanitarian aid from churches and organisations jumps into the breach created by the inability of Member States and the international community to find a satisfactory solution. For this reason I have some sympathy for the appeal not to punish these organisations for giving assistance to illegal immigrants. But a more nuanced definition is required. A problem arises where the judgment of the independent judiciary based on legislation is constantly undermined by the subjective judgment of aid providers. Apart from that, how do you define ‘humanitarian aid’? Does it also apply to a charity that, for example, has the aim of helping as many poor Russians as possible to enter a Member State illegally?</p>
<p class="contents">The dramatic circumstances of illegal immigration are a humanitarian disgrace. Stringent, harmonised criminal legislation on traffickers in human beings is necessary. To complement this a strict but fair asylum policy is needed, which must send a clear signal of discouragement to illegal immigrants. Accordingly, I support the proposals of the French Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Proposing to step up the penal framework for prosecution for assisting the illegal entry and residence of immigrants is tantamount to making solidarity a crime. The proposed amendments are right to distinguish the assistance provided in return for payment from the assistance provided out of solidarity, on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminalising the people and organisations fighting against Fortress Europe is not, however, an effective tactic against the underground networks and smugglers. What should be combated, rather, is this ever more restrictive visa and asylum policy which forces people to enter European Union territory illegally. What should be combated are the structural adjustment policies and policies imposing the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> which exacerbate unemployment in candidate countries, and the logic of development aid packages for countries in the South which are completely inadequate and unfairly distributed. A policy of cancelling debt and of ensuring equitable development aid would be a first essential step towards a different kind of European policy on immigration. We are resolutely opposed to the logic behind criminalising immigration and that is why i voted against the draft French initiative, even in its amended form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, on the contrary, in response to an initiative from the French Republic which was, I must stress, relatively acceptable, is nothing but a trap and, worse than that, an incitement to crime, illegal immigration, lawlessness and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur seeks to punish only the smugglers and organisation involved in illegal immigration networks. Are the foreigners that have entered a Member State’s territory illegally not to be seen as having committed any offence (Article 2, Amendment No 9)? How can we fail to be outraged at this? Are we to think that illegal immigrants should be seen as the victims of a system in which they are actually the players?</p>
<p class="contents">If criminalisation must seek primarily to penalise the organisers of illegal immigration, it must also firmly penalise the immigrants themselves, specifically by deporting them back to their country of origin in order to make them accept their responsibilities and deter them from offending again.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the report aims to exempt the humanitarian organisations assisting illegal immigrants from any form of penalty (Article 4, Amendment No 11). Illegal immigration should not be encouraged in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Our leaders must adopt a hard line in combating illegal because in so doing they are also combating security problems, organised crime (drugs trafficking, money laundering, etc.), and even the forced prostitution of young women from Eastern Europe or Latin America, most of whom have illegally entered one of the countries of the European Union, which is unfortunately only a mythical El Dorado. Our national governments must beware, for there is no room for lenience and fine feelings here: they can only lead to a lax and irresponsible attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">By leading policies with an inordinate emphasis on human rights, by practising a policy of systematically regularising the status of illegal immigrants and immigrants in irregular situation and by foisting the integration and assimilation of these people from outside Europe on our societies, we are endangering the whole social and demographic balance and the very identity of the European nations affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This type of humanitarian aid is now entirely lawful in, for example, Sweden and ought not to be criminalised.</p>

The basis must be that people should be allowed to travel freely into the European Union and not be prevented from doing so by a restrictive policy on visas and work permits.</p>

In the past that migration was actually encouraged by governments, since businesses suffered from a shortage of labour, and it looks as if this is about to be repeated. The fundamental problem, the unequal distribution of wealth among humankind, is not solved in this way. There are also people who are not asked to come, but who are forced to leave their country of origin. Once they have left they can no longer return in safety, since the prevailing regime threatens them with imprisonment or even the death penalty. Unfortunately it is still common for such people to be turned away or sent back at the border. The tough outer borders of ‘Fortress Europe’ are driving more and more people into the hands of unscrupulous human smugglers, who are greedy for fat profits and abandon people to their lot before the port or border river is reached. It is right that this mafia should be tackled. On the other hand it is madness to start punishing the solidarity of pressure groups and churches with political refugees and workers employed for a long period of time in a Member State of the EU without the correct papers.

The report calls for an increase in quotas and fixed prices on cotton and also seeks to regulate the role of cotton producers' associations. We have also rejected the Izquierdo Rojo report, calling for increased aid for the production of nuts and locust beans. Both reports call for the protectionist measures, such as preservation of the system for community preference.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not reasonable that half of the Union's budget is devoted to subsidising production and exports of agricultural products. We believe that EU funds should instead be spent on purposes where cross-border cooperation is needed. Environmental protection, aid for reconstruction and development assistance are fields where increased funding is essential, not least in light of the upcoming enlargement of the Union. The common agricultural policy is not only very costly for the European citizens, but also contributes to higher consumer prices and lower quality. Consumers express concern about European food production and have rightly begun to question the present the agricultural policies. Export subsidies, leading to the dumping of EU food surpluses on the world market, is the reason behind the serious difficulties for food production in many developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP was established in order to secure the provision of food after the second world war, not to subsidise unprofitable cultivation of crops used for textile production. The common agricultural policy of today has lost its political legitimacy and must be completely reformed. All aid to exports and production should be abolished. Agriculture needs to adapt to market rules in order to be exposed to competition.

<p class="contents">It would be unbelievable if, given the shortfall in cotton production, the European Commission actually banned further cotton production, but that is in fact the case! There are quotas and penalties in place to limit European cotton production to approximately 1 million tonnes, instead of the 1.5 million tonnes that we are capable of producing. There is a ban on cotton production in Spain and Greece, with hundreds of small farms in Andalusia, Thrace and Valencia. To make matters worse, there are plans to increase the so-called “coresponsibility” levy to more than the current penalty of 50% of the overshoot of the quota.</p>
<p class="contents">And all this benefits the United States and Australia. In this instance, unlike the case for sugar and rice, it is no longer a matter of sacrificing our own farmers in order to assist the poor in – for instance –the Sudan, a country responsible for exterminating the Christian population of the south. Oh no, there is no such excuse in the case of cotton. It is not like the milk sector, where quotas can be justified due to overproduction. Our sacrifices are not justified in terms of assisting the 48 least developed countries.</p>

In Egypt and Uzbekistan, countries that are far more dependent than Greece on cotton production, this has caused major environmental problems. That consideration might be a reason for me not to agree with the report of my fellow group Member, Mr Korakas. From a Greek perspective and particularly from that of the small farmers in that country, the report is of course quite justified. Its starting premise is the protection and expansion of production and the creation of the financial preconditions for that. In the longer term, however, those considerations of incomes policy must be weighed against environmental interests, the conditions under which imported cotton is produced and the burden of the common agricultural policy on the financial resources of the EU. Until those matters are tackled in a fundamental way I am able to support the Korakas proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is well known that a vast array of chemicals are used in cotton-production and we therefore support the Commission's aim for Member States to determine and adopt the appropriate environmental measures to regulate the use of agricultural land used to produce cotton.

There were nonetheless a number of wordings which were of central importance to ourselves in the ELDR Group and which made it all the clearer that the Stockholm Summit will also have to debate important reforms in favour of a competitive Europe. It is a question of further liberalisation, a more favourable business climate and better education and further education. The aspect of the report relating to these issues fell through and was voted down, and so the whole of recital E also came to nothing. The ELDR Group therefore chose to vote against the proposal as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">Immediately following the Lisbon Council, in March 2000, I endorsed the new working method, the new “open” method of coordination suggested by the Council, thinking that it might help to reduce the number of European regulations, which are, by definition, centralised and authoritarian, and to favour arrangements “between equals” that were less restrictive and more likely to adapt flexibly to suit the needs of each party while respecting their freedom to make their own decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the Commission is now proposing to introduce an arsenal of 28 structural indicators, plus seven general economic indicators, to measure the relative economic performance of the Member States. The Bullmann report lost no time before hurling itself into the breach and proposing to add a whole host of indicators in the fields of allocating public expenditure, the nature of this expenditure, the environment, productivity, employment, youth unemployment, social exclusion, poverty including a breakdown by age and sex, and Lord knows what else.</p>
<p class="contents">This might possibly be a valid approach if the aim was to collect data on our various situations. According to the Bullmann report, however, these indicators were clearly intended to provide the basis for new European regulations which would have fleshed out “the Union’s social legislative framework”. The report goes on to specify that this regulatory strategy was to be crowned by an “interinstitutional agreement” enabling the European Parliament to be fully involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Even at the time of the Lisbon Council, I was already voicing my opposition to the authoritarian tone of some of the conclusions, such as those, for example, which took on society’s role in deciding that it was necessary to increase the rate of participation of women in the labour market. Yet the proposals of the Bullmann report could well have vastly accentuated this sideways shift. After rejecting this report, we now hope that the Stockholm Council, in March, will bring the Commission back into line. We must not slide down the slippery slope from open coordination to closed planning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not acceptable to be in favour of a whole lot of new indicators and further statistics and, at the same time, warn that statistics do not solve problems but, rather, create new ones. The parallels with a planned economy become all too clear when it is believed that the Commission must control economic development with the help of a whole lot of economic and social indicators. Instead, I want the Stockholm Summit to focus upon liberalisation and dynamic deregulation. It is important to emphasise that politicians do not create jobs.

In imitation of the Davos Forum, bringing together the elite of the ruling classes, at the Lisbon Summit the EU set itself the goal of becoming “the most competitive and dynamic... economy in the world”. After the launch of the single market in 1985, and of the euro in 1997, this is just one more step in building a Europe which responds only to the interests of capital.</p>

This is heightened by the recent Treaty of Nice and will be exacerbated by closer cooperation between governments centred on the new convergence criteria.</p>

<p class="contents">The ΕU continues to exert pressure on Member States to sell off the family silver by handing all transport, postal and telecommunications services over to the private sector.

Even the rapporteur admits that the current adverse situation and the high rate of unemployment have been brought about by intensifying and strengthening neo-liberal, monetarist policies.</p>
<p class="contents">These economic reforms will result in a guaranteed level of poverty, not a minimum level of prosperity for workers, while the view is being promoted that a modern social state need only provide certain minimum services to its people, in the form of charity. Prosperity is, of course, being promoted for big business, which is becoming more and more unaccountable. It is contradictory, ironic, hypocritical and provocative to workers to propose that the way to combat unemployment is to strengthen the competitiveness of companies through reduced labour costs, full liberalisation and flexibility of the labour market and atypical forms of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for the public sector, stable, permanent and full employment and a better and protected social security system and social protection system in general should form the backbone of economic policy. We want to achieve stable economic development based on healthy internal demand by improving the workers' purchasing power, concentrating on crucial sectors such as creating and maintaining infrastructures, education, health, research and applying economic development policies which help to increase employment by creating permanent jobs. This is the way to achieve the objectives of full and stable employment, stronger workers' rights, high-quality employment, training and job skills and shorter working times without any cut in wages.</p>

Yet, when reading the explanatory statement, we find some perfectly inadmissible statements such as this, “the economic situation no longer allows the same level of social protection for European workers: there is unfortunately a direct link between social protection and what separates us from full employment.”</p>
<p class="contents">Is this a stylistic infelicity or a Freudian slip betraying an inner conviction? At any event, we see this as an opportunity to restate our view that liberalisation must be carried out while maintaining the level of social protection. The critical issue is to frame new procedures that are based on both private management and public-minded regulations, which will make it possible to offer the same services at a reduced cost, and even better service, for users are more likely to be satisfied if the service on offer is more adaptable.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the principles which must, in France, underlie the reform of the social welfare system and the educational system. In both instances, the public and the private sector must be allowed to compete fairly, within the terms of public-minded regulations and a minimum service provision defined by law. In this way, competition will have the effect of driving administration costs down and pushing the quality of the service up. And the countries of Europe will be able to define a form of liberalisation which is compatible with their own cultural models and desire for social solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the privatisation of the post office or the railways in those countries of Europe where this has already taken place has demonstrated that the first to suffer from this are the public sector workers and service users, since private operators are ready to sacrifice absolutely everything except their profits, does not prevent the rapporteur’s making so bold as to guarantee that “current safety levels” for rail will be maintained, despite the evidence to the contrary.</p>

Where is the much-promised social progress in all that?</p>
<p class="contents">The massive increase in productivity would make it perfectly possible to guarantee a better standard of living for all the working and the retired population if a small minority of property owners were not determined to seize all profits for themselves. Consequently, the stated objective of making “the European economy the most competitive and dynamic... in the world” cannot be achieved except on the backs of the workers, who would bear the entire burden of boosting the profits of the major capitalist groups in the form of deterioration in their working and living conditions.</p>

<p class="contents">The concerns arise basically from the need to preserve the freedoms and rights that already existed in this Special Administrative Region before the transfer of sovereignty, including religious freedom, which stem from the principle, so arduously negotiated by the Portuguese and Chinese authorities, of ‘one country, two systems’.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiatives are the specific actions that the European Union can stimulate and promote for Macau with the aim of ensuring that the region maintains a democratic collective life, in which the human rights and individual freedoms of the Macanese are respected and in which prosperity and peace are valued.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight three of these initiatives that are intended to preserve the autonomy and specific nature of Macau in relation to China. The first is the permanent monitoring of the implementation of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. The second is the boosting of European investment in the SAR, as a corollary of active cooperation at all levels, and the third initiative concerns the call for the urgent appointment of a European Union representative in Macau, in order to stimulate relations between the two regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal governed Macau for four hundred years. We are not ashamed of our past in that region, in fact, quite the opposite. On the one hand, our presence fostered peaceful coexistence between the European and Chinese civilisations and, on the other, we left the Macanese a region with outstanding prospects for growth, with legislative, customs and judicial autonomy and where the rights and freedoms of every citizen are part of a legacy of civilisation that we have the duty to preserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I closed my eyes for a second and saw a vision: I saw the Commissioner for Research, Mr Busquin, and the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, having dinner together and talking animatedly about research in Europe.

A pinch of good intentions regarding the position of women in research, a nod of acknowledgement towards the social sciences, a handful of allusions to the role of cooperation in scientific matters between the Member States, or the role of research in the development of culture and even of employment for all, before coming to the main course, the only real meat of the matter: a substantial package of subsidies for businesses. For that is the main if not the only motivation of the European Commission, the Council and the author of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are being asked to support is a move to strengthen the private sector’s grip on public sector research, facilitating the exploitation of the results of public sector research by private capital, and the “dramatic reduction”, written in black and white, “in the red tape that obstructs” it.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur claims that, “It would be an advantage for companies to have better access to research results.” An advantage only for the business owners and shareholders who have been promised further subsidies disguised as aid to research. No one is fooled by the fact that the report only makes reference to SMEs. All major corporations have small and medium-sized enterprises as subsidiaries, particularly in the field of research.</p>

I regret to have to say that this motion for a resolution on Kosovo is quite unbelievable. Once again we are suffering from total amnesia. We are acting as if everything that has taken place in Yugoslavia over the last ten to twelve years did not take place. We are allowing Mr Kostuníca to let the Serbian people remain in ignorance of everything that Milosevic kept from them for the previous ten years, namely the events in Vukovar, in Sarajevo, in Kosovo, even quite recently, just eighteen months ago. I find this perfectly unacceptable. All eyes are on Belgrade.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand, Mr President, Mrs Pack, the need to assist the new Serbian authorities in tackling the problems which exist, but this cannot be done at the expense of justice – or a modicum of justice – i.e. by failing to challenge and condemn the actions of Mr Milosevic and the main Serbian leaders. Nor can this be achieved while closing our eyes to a situation which is perfectly intolerable in terms of international law. The 700 Kosovars still detained in Serbia were sentenced in absolute contravention of the laws of the international community. Only UNMIK and the international tribunal in The Hague would be authorised to sentence these people.</p>
<p class="contents">An amnesty would therefore not be valid, and I would urge the responsible parties within the Commission to refer the matter, with all due discipline, to the competent Commissioners. There is no need to pressure Mr Kostuníca to grant an amnesty, all he has to do is to hand over the parties concerned to the head of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, Mr Hækkerup. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that these pictures represent the beginning of the end of the Balkan tragedy. I appreciate the fact that, for the first time, Mr Solana appeared not as the evil oracle from Euripides' ancient Greek tragedy Iphigenia, but as the good oracle.</p>
<p class="contents">A starting point for a policy in the area to dull the feelings of those responsible in connection with any man-made disasters in the area should, I think, be decisively supported by the European Parliament. This House needs to send a message of support for stability, peace and the development of cooperation in the area. The people in the area must understand that there is no question of their becoming big or small, because poverty never makes people big and as long as clashes continue, the only outcome will be poverty and unhappiness and that is all they will share.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, because stability, development and cooperation must be our prime considerations, this is the basic thrust of this motion. The people in the area must understand, as must we, that occupied protectorates in any shape or form never allow economic development, they never allow peace and they never allow countries or people in the area to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the visit, the interplay of circumstances surrounding the exchanges in Belgrade and the interplay of circumstances for us is an exceptional, useful and crucial interplay and we must help it. We need to understand that, if democracy, peace and cooperation are to succeed, we have to surpass ourselves. This motion, which defines a wide framework which can be used as a political framework for the next round of developments in the area, gives us the prospect of doing so and we should all support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one side are the Kosovars, waiting impatiently for a decision on the final status of their country, also waiting impatiently for elections and still – and let us be clear, understandably – full of hatred for the Serbs. In that climate the extremists have a free hand, for example in the Presevo area, where they are actually attacking KFOR troops, a situation that, in my eyes, and also for Mr Dupuis, is totally unacceptable. On the other side there is the Serbian Government which, with new faces in charge and fine plans, can be sure of a great deal of sympathy from the international community. It has, for example, come up with proposals for the same area, around Presevo, which I definitely think offer a good basis for negotiations and which I also think the Albanians should respond to. What one can now see happening is a shift in international sympathy from the awkward Kosovars to the cooperative Serbs. That is the moment – and the moment is now – that the balancing act is most difficult. What is the task of the EU? We must hold the Serbs to their promises which, however splendid they may be, as yet exist only on paper. We must isolate the extremist Kosovars and impress upon the moderate Kosovars, using force or persuasion as necessary, that they must cooperate with the Serbs, and that they cannot go on fighting them and pressing their demands. Once again, President, I can imagine easier tasks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo. We are not discussing Serbia and current policy in Serbia proper. I agree with much of what you said, Olivier. Believe me, those Members who were in Belgrade have taken a clear line on the conditions. For us, there can be no money unless the conditions are fulfilled. No one has ever disputed that, apart from Commission President Prodi, whom I hereby urge to desist from such comments.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me come back to today’s debate. It is a matter of how things stand now in Kosovo. I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point. Unless we know quite soon what is to happen next in Kosovo, the difficulties will simply accumulate down there. The problem is that KFOR troops have become the targets of Serbian and Albanian attacks, although KFOR is actually there to protect both of these ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, in a nutshell, is that Mr Hækkerup will have to call elections very soon. To do that, he must know what powers the elected bodies will have. But we need these bodies so that the Serbian side has Kosovar negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have the subject of southern Serbia. I believe that KFOR, like other bodies, has not done all it should have done there. Where have the weapons come from for these new extremists? They have, of course, been transferred from the old KLA to the new KLA. In my view, KFOR, with its 50 000-strong force in Kosovo, ought to be able to establish order in the Presevo Valley. I appeal to KFOR to do so, lest we lose our credibility in that corner of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, of course, in the truth of what the Mayor of Presevo said in Belgrade, namely that the population of Kosovo would like to remain in Serbia if only the Albanians in the region could be treated at long last on a par with the Serbs. They want to be part of everything that Yugoslav citizenship implies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the government’s new plan is good. It is pursuing the right path, and we should support it. To tell the truth, I am a little saddened that Mr Kostuníca has said it will all happen without supervision by the EU. Why should we not play a part? We are good mediators. We can help the Serbs and Albanians to live together in peace, and I hope we shall be allowed to help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must now protect the Serbs, who are minority in Kosovo. Moreover, we must say to the extremist Albanian insurgents that we are not, therefore, there to support the ideas of Albanian extremism. We are there to support peace and human rights, and we shall do what we can to prevent Albanian extremists from creating unrest in the new democratic Serbia. I should like to assure Mr Dupuis that there were six of us from Parliament who spent the weekend visiting the new leaders in Belgrade. We received assurances that that they would cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, set up a truth commission and grant amnesty to conscientious objectors etc. What we can do here in Parliament is to hold the new leaders to these promises and, if they do not live up to them, then there are things we can do, for we are, of course, the great aid provider, granting large amounts of money, now and in the years to come, to the new Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, finally, to say something which is almost a remark on the rules of procedure. The purpose of these urgent topics we are now debating is, of course, to draw the public’s attention to serious problems in world politics and to serious violations of human rights and democracy. It is therefore a paradox that we are holding the debate at a time when there are fewest people here. There is no-one from the press. It is, in fact, almost like performing a striptease in the dark, if you will pardon the expression. I also think it is a paradox that we are insisting on the Commission’s being present – and the Council too ought, of course, to be here – but we have written our motions for resolution before we have heard what they have to say. It is both paradoxical and frivolous. I would therefore conclude my speech with the request that urgent topics of this kind be put on the agenda on Wednesdays when the Council and the Commission are here and that we only vote on the motions for resolution once we have heard the remarks on our proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot compress five days’ work into a Wednesday just because some people want to work for one day and have six days off every week. Perhaps there are employees in other walks of life who would welcome a similar arrangement. In my opinion, what goes on here brings shame on this Parliament, and I find it scandalous, Mr Haarder, that you should encourage this by trying to eliminate Thursday sittings too, now that the Friday sittings have gone.</p>
<p class="contents">But now to the topic itself. I wish to say very clearly that we, as Europeans, bear a great responsibility for Kosovo – and this topical and urgent debate, incidentally, was originally devoted to Kosovo, not southern Serbia; it is listed in the agenda as the ‘situation in Kosovo’. In this respect I am not entirely happy with the resolution, and I should also like to point out that my name appears erroneously on the resolution, which I did not sign. May I ask that this be corrected, because I believe – as the last few speeches, and particularly Mrs Pack’s eloquent intervention, have graphically illustrated – that it is a matter of stabilising the situation in Kosovo, for as long as the situation in Kosovo is unstable, there can be no stability in the neighbouring regions either, including southern Serbia and, indeed, the whole of Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is absolutely imperative, as Mr Lagendijk quite rightly said, to take the decisive step by arranging for elections to be held in Kosovo. Until we have democratically legitimised authorities for Kosovo to act as negotiating partners of the democratically legitimised Serbs, there will be no peace settlement in the region, and we shall incur a heavy burden of guilt if we keep postponing these elections for every conceivable reason, because by so doing we undermine Mr Rugova’s position, and extremist forces – whose background, by the way, is obscure, to say the least – are able to exploit the situation and make internal political capital out of the Albanians’ frustration. As I have said, our inactivity weakens the position of Mr Rugova, who embodies people’s hopes for a peaceful solution. Instead of just pointing the finger at others and saying that this one or that one is undemocratic, we should recognise the fact that we ourselves are neglecting our primary responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close with a remark aimed at the Serbian President: if he does not accept EU mediation to resolve this thorny issue, I wonder why he accepts money from the European Union.</p>

So too is the confidence of our own citizens and the people of the Balkans in the European institutions as well as the stability of the region itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Our action in Kosovo a couple of years ago was not exactly a paragon of speed or unity. For too many months it was not a paragon of efficiency either. Our people reacted with disgust to Milosevic’s odious policy which resulted in oppression and terror for the Albanian Kosovars and in their mass exodus. Public opinion in our own countries demanded determined action such as was eventually taken. Military intervention of that nature was likely to generate misgivings and even rejection amongst some sectors of our society and even more so in Yugoslavia itself. It is only fair to reiterate that we gave political consent to that action and that it did serve to curtail Milosevic’s excesses and the sufferings of the people of Kosovo. It also contributed to Milosevic being discredited and defeated a few months later.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our consistency is now being put to the test. We can no longer conceal our embarrassment as we witness how some of the former victims in Kosovo are turning into tormentors. They are persecuting their fellow citizens of Serb origin and driving them out of their territory in as hateful a process of ethnic cleansing as the previous one. Those same elements are involved in armed aggression on other Serb territory with an Albanian population. At the same time, Albanian Kosovar mafias are operating as part of organised crime networks in several of our countries. It appears that they are doing so to raise funds with which to finance their guerrilla activities.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is incompatible with the objectives pursued by the European Union and we must not tolerate it. The European Union is contributing very substantial sums to the rebuilding of Kosovo. Nevertheless, that contribution must be strictly conditional on respect for human rights, recognition of existing borders adopted by the international community and the cessation of all military and terrorist operations by Albanian Kosovars within their territory or beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability of Yugoslavia, Albania, Macedonia and the rest of the region may depend on our consistency and firmness. It could hinge on our stifling the extremist and expansionist action of certain elements of the Albanian Kosovar population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we must see that as an absolutely fundamental principle. But the situation is, of course, rather more complicated in Kosovo and in the Presevo valley than simply dealing with a few extremist Albanians and heaping abuse on them today. Of course I shall support the resolution, but really I should have preferred it if we had tackled in one go today not only the situation in the Presevo valley, but also what is still happening daily in Mitrovica. Because there – and we must not forget that – it is not only policemen, not only KFOR troops, but also citizens who are attacked daily, and it is no fun living there. Very many colleagues have been there and know what the situation is like.</p>
<p class="contents">I am amazed at the warmth with which the international community is treating President Kostuníca at this moment. We are making a fuss of him, and supporting him, and when he came to power we quite rightly told him that there must be immediate emergency aid. Of course I was in favour of that, but we are now at a turning point. We are at a moment when we are moving from emergency aid to structural help. I believe that this is a turning point that we must take advantage of. We must use it to make clear once and for all to Mr Kostuníca and his regime that he will have to take fundamental steps to solve the problems in Kosovo. That means, in the first instance, the release of prisoners. We have still made no progress at all with this. This is a real scandal. If one comes into contact with Albanian Kosovars, that is the first thing they ask about. Secondly, I believe that we must use the turning point finally to force Mr Kostuníca to consider a truly fundamental political solution for the Kosovo region, and in my view that means autonomy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The future shape of the country is the subject of intensive discussion, and there is much talk of decentralisation, even in Serbia itself, and of a new relationship with the ethnic minorities. Another subject that is frequently discussed is the need to strengthen local government and, particularly in southern Serbia, the need to give the Albanian minority fair representation in the local authorities, where the rules have hitherto been stacked against them. Every act of violence, whether in southern Serbia or in Mitrovica, disrupts the painstaking peace process that is currently taking place in the Balkans. The Yugoslav and Serb authorities must naturally take a firm line in their dealings with the minorities. That is what we in Parliament have always advocated and will continue to advocate, and there is no room for compromise there. It is important, however, that the measures taken should be realistic. Elections in Kosovo are certainly one such measure, but they must be preceded by a precise definition of the powers and authority that the elected representatives will have.</p>
<p class="contents">The present problems cannot be solved overnight. They can only be solved by a consensus of all interested parties, states and ethnic groups. That is a complex process, and I entirely agree with Mrs Pack, perhaps not in detail but certainly in principle, that Europe must take the initiative here, because none of the parties in the Balkans enjoys the level of trust that would enable it to launch a successful peace initiative at this stage. Only the European Union enjoys that level of trust. Neither the United States of America nor Russia nor any of the Balkan States and societies have the requisite degree of authority. And if Europe were caught napping now, that would pose serious problems. I can only agree with another of the previous speakers, Mr Posselt, on the money issue. We already pay out enough in the world and in particular regions without having a stabilising influence. It must be different in the Balkans. We are willing to pay, but we also want to have a say, so that stability and peace can be established in the region.</p>

The European Union has raised this matter on numerous occasions, most recently during the troika's visit to Belgrade last week.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the authorities are working on an amnesty law for the thousands of political prisoners imprisoned under the Milosevic regime. We know that in principle this law should have a very wide scope. Only a few hundred prisoners sentenced for acts of terrorism would be excluded, mostly Albanian Kosovars.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in Serbia are dealing with each individual case under urgent procedure. It is, however, true that they have no intention of granting a general pardon. They have made it clear that they will not free a single prisoner, Serb or Albanian, who has been fairly sentenced for that type of offence.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, we shall continue to raise the issue and press for an early solution. We shall have this and other matters very much in mind in the coming months as we negotiate this year’s programme of aid to Serbia with both the Serb and the Yugoslav authorities. It is very important for all concerned that the new democratic authorities maintain their commitment to continue with the reforms outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised another matter in the resolution, namely the problem of the tension in the Presevo valley in southern Serbia. The resolutions adopted are also in line with the political positions adopted by the Union, which unreservedly condemns violence and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the European Union we have highlighted the moderation displayed by the new leaders of the Yugoslav Republic and Serbia and we urge them to continue in this vein. We all have to be very clear on one point. Some of you have already referred to it and we agree entirely with you. A new era is dawning in the Balkans and it must not be marred by violence from any source whatsoever. The European Union must therefore rejoice at the plan put forward by the authorities to solve the current crisis. This programme includes proposals for dealing with the grievances felt by the people of that poor and underdeveloped region, with all the attendant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the European Union has just received the plan and is studying it. It is worth pointing out that this is Belgrade’s first attempt to reach a negotiated settlement through dialogue amongst the various ethnic groups in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This is indeed important. Milosevic never attempted to do so. The principle of negotiation and dialogue warrants our support and will receive it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is increasing the number of monitoring missions in the Presevo valley and the Commission is considering ways of increasing the already substantial aid devoted to the area. This currently amounts to approximately EUR 1 million for fuel and for educational and humanitarian programmes. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Covic, is due in Brussels today and will discuss the plan with the Commission too. For their part, the Member States are considering how they could contribute. KFOR is playing an important role in Kosovo in an effort to restrict the activities of the extremists. Furthermore, both UNMIK and the European Union are putting pressure on Albanian Kosovar politicians to distance themselves from the extremists in Presevo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Democratic Republic of the Congo is no exception to this rule. Despite the 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, which provided for a UN-supervised ceasefire, the disarmament of all the armed factions, the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the establishment of internal dialogue between the government and the opposition, both armed and civilian, the state of war has nonetheless continued and is paralysing both the economic and political situation throughout the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must condemn in the strongest terms all these acts of violence perpetrated against the civilian population and must also condemn the military intervention by neighbouring countries and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the assassination of President Laurent Kabila, the international community and the European Parliament must intervene in this political transition. We must ask the new Head of State to lift the ban affecting political parties. Mr Joseph Kabila must demand and must clearly announce a timetable for the opening of internal Congolese dialogue and the organisation of free elections. The civilian population, whose economy and welfare has already been hit hard – particularly in the suburbs of Kinshasa, must not once again fall victim to the lack of political interest on the part of our continent, nor of the perfectly casual attitude of investors and firms operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, more especially in terms of human rights, the environment and the rule of law.</p>

The fact is that the former president had become an obstacle to the implementation of the Lusaka peace agreement. He was eliminated by the very people who helped bring him to power. His successor and son, Joseph Kabila, can count for the time being on a great deal of credit from the international community. All the same, he is the main character in a script written and directed by others, by Angola and Zimbabwe, but also by the hardliners from his father’s government. It looks very much as if there has been a change of driver, but that the bus remains the same. The young Kabila has awakened high expectations. The time has now come for him to act. As of now the Lusaka agreement is the only framework for a permanent solution. Specifically, withdrawal of all foreign troops from Congolese territory and the simultaneous initiation of inter-Congolese dialogue. The international community must quickly decide on its attitude and particularly push for the deployment of MONUC of the UN peacekeeping forces. There is also an urgent need for more coherent action, both between Europe and America and between the various Member States. Certain Member States continue to approach the conflict in the Great Lakes region on the basis of an imagined, artificial conflict between English-speakers and French-speakers. Others mainly try to secure their own economic interests. There are limits to cynicism. If the window of opportunity is not quickly used to force a real breakthrough in the peace process, violence will soon flare up again and the first African world war will further escalate.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Council and also the Commission to take a more assertive stance, because only if Europe speaks with one voice can it make a meaningful contribution to ending a war which has already cost too many lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A country containing some 300 tribes, some of which live in total isolation, as the communications network is virtually non-existent. A country where both production and supply are achievable only with great difficulty. A country that is, moreover, wedged between Rwanda and Uganda. Rwanda, which meanwhile for its own security has moved its borders up to between 200 and 300 km into the Congolese interior. Uganda, which under the guise of combating rebel movements extended its influence to significant parts of Congo, up to and including Kisangani.</p>
<p class="contents">The neutral position, which puts the Lusaka agreements first, involving the withdrawal of foreign troops and the establishment of partition areas both on the borders with Rwanda and Uganda and between the migrants themselves, is a passive first step that may lead to the stabilisation of the front and the belated return of the many refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it will be useful if Europe, in contrast to the hesitant attitude of American policy towards Kabila, plays a key role. After all, Europe has an unbelievable potential impact because of its knowledge of the thinking behind events in Congo and can once more play a role to the benefit of the population, helping it do battle with desperate poverty, squalid health condition, starvation and epidemic disease. For example, without taking sides, Europe could support Belgian efforts to bring some stability to a population of over 55 million men and women in a land area larger than that of the enlarged Europe. In this way Europe would prove that it wants to respond to the priorities that the new President set out in his inaugural address.

The purpose of my speech is, in particular, to draw attention to the particular responsibilities of Angola, a country governed by a totally corrupt military power that has taken advantage of the weaknesses of western capitalism to oppress its people and to threaten the peace, stability and security of the entire region. This is of particular concern to us, all the more so because, in Cabinda, there are Portuguese citizens who have been held for over nine months, in a tragedy as long-standing as that of the western tourists who were kidnapped in the Philippines approximately a year ago. These people are being held captive by guerrilla forces fighting for the independence of Cabinda. The truth of the situation is that Angola’s Government is not able to solve these problems and is spreading its instability and greed into neighbouring territories.</p>

The Congo is an area of concern to us and Joseph Kabila’s rise to power may indeed provide a fresh opportunity to reopen the Lusaka negotiations along the moderate line he has taken to date, particularly during his visits to France, Belgium and the United States. True, so far all we have to go on are words, which must be translated into deeds. We shall certainly be monitoring developments closely.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we feel that this is an opportunity we should not hesitate to grasp in an effort to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict, particularly now that it seems a significant cease-fire is being observed. At the time, the European Union actively supported the Lusaka negotiations with a significant allocation of regional funds. The mechanisms set up under the agreement were allocated a fund for the joint military commission. These were relatively large funds, amounting to several million euro. They were essential in achieving the three fundamental objectives: negotiation, the military commission and facilitating political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are endeavouring to do even more in terms of financial assistance and humanitarian aid. ECHO allocated EUR 20 million last year and an allocation of EUR 35 million is planned for this year. Yet we are not only offering economic support to assure food supply and health services, but also attempting to promote the negotiated solution we all hope for based on the Lusaka agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is studying the possibility of supporting the revival of the peace and reconciliation process through programmes for the rehabilitation, demobilisation and reintegration of displaced people. Given the present situation it is too early, however, to define possible future action. Neither the technical nor the political conditions exist to allow us to detail the action we might take.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that I have taken note of the request made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro to consider the extent to which we might be able to take the lead on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, I doubt that this introduction will be enough to make Parliament realise that there is a crisis in China, that this typical Communist regime is, most tragically, turning into a National Communist regime and that this presents a risk now, and in the future, to security in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the people of China, Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China have no freedom of religion or conscience. In particular, the Falun Gong movement and other groups have been subjected to repression on a par with that seen during the Cultural Revolution. Already 500 000 people have been arrested, more than 150 people have died in prison, usually after having been torture. What I am describing here is the situation now, not the situation during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a duty to take an extremely firm stance. The resolution is a good text. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Malmström, who played an instrumental role in this task. The members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are certainly not aware of an incident which in another, less tragic, context might be considered amusing. At the meeting to discuss the compromise, one of the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists recommended that Falun Gong be excluded from this resolution, asserting that it was something other than a religion. Freedom of religion and freedom of conscience are part of the same concept and each of us must define it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are part and parcel of our democracies, and we expect them to be applied everywhere as basic principles so that the dignity of human life is truly respected throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">For a while it looked as if the situation were taking a turn for the better in the People’s Republic of China too. Sadly, in more recent times this appears to have changed, and progress seems to have not only been halted but even reversed. For example, I greatly regret that, while the People’s Republic of China has signed important documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the process of ratifying and implementing the two covenants has yet to be completed. That is a great pity. This process needs to be reactivated. I therefore appeal on behalf of my Group to the People’s Republic of China to respect people’s civil liberties just as we endeavour to do in our democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add a postscript to the honourable Member Mr Dupuis, just to mention to him that the Falun Gong say that they are not a religious institution. We should also respect the way in which institutions define themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the repression against Falun Gong is totally absurd. Can you imagine repression against all the people who ever follow yoga classes in Europe? The Chinese Government goes so far as to imprison cyber-dissidents meaning people who create or manage websites whose content does not please the government like Mr Huan Qi who is being tried now.</p>

It is the opium of the people.” Marxism-Leninism is in terminal decline, but other ideologies have survived. China is far from permitting freedom of expression, let alone freedom of religious observance, for Tibetans, Mongolians and members of Christian churches or Muslim communities. The Tibetans are persecuted. It is an offence to display pictures of the Dalai Lama. Those who stand up for their beliefs face the threat of lengthy prison sentences. I recall the initiative of the Tibet intergroup of the European Parliament to propose the nun Ngawang Sangdrol, who has spent the last nine years in prison, for this year’s Sakharov Prize. The eleven-year-old Panchen Lama, the second-highest authority in Tibetan Buddhism, has been abducted and has since been cut off from the outside world. He was not even allowed to meet with Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group expects China, as a future WTO member and a global player, to assume its responsibility at long last and to ratify and implement the international agreements on civil and political rights as well as those on economic, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the EU Member States to take the opportunity presented by the meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. Put the obstruction of freedom of religion and the gross violations of human rights in China at the top of the agenda. And let us remember that, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, one of the few successes of the Nice Summit, the Member States enshrined freedom of religion, conscience, expression and information in the second chapter. I hope that our European Commission will show the same powers of initiative. <span class="italic">Tashi delek!</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that a divided and backward country made a new start and started rebuilding its economy, in a way that was enthusiastically received by masses of workers and peasants, was felt as a threat by the outside world. Over half a century later the heirs to that revolution are still in power. Their ideology and the enthusiasm of the population have gone, but unfortunately they have retained their dictatorial traits with a vengeance. For this regime, economic growth and political calm are of supreme importance and as a result anything that runs counter to them is attacked fanatically. That bodes ill for ethnic and religious minorities and those with political criticisms. Organisations are banned, people are locked up and death sentences are liberally used. Small, powerless countries that breach human rights at home, rightly attract foreign criticism. In the case of China, the most populous country on earth, things are usually different. People with widely differing political views say that it is a large and important country that may become a major trading partner and that we must therefore stay on good terms with it. My group believes that an end should be put to this special treatment. Human rights, including freedom of religion, cannot simply stop at the Chinese border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the situation appears to be getting worse and worse. Torture is on the increase. There is frequent use of the death penalty. Freedom of expression is limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group is very worried about this and appeals to the Commission and the Council to put increased pressure on China regarding human rights issues. The world cannot look silently on as the world’s most populous country systematically engages in violations against its citizens on a daily basis. We have high hopes that the Swedish Presidency will succeed in bringing about a united approach prior to the Geneva meeting in a month’s time and then, in the course of the meeting, will get a resolution passed concerning China.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese have extremely limited opportunities to practise their religion. Catholics report systematic persecution. Mosques are burned down. In Tibet, the oppression of the Tibetan people, especially of Buddhist monks, continues. Torture, re-education camps and imprisonment under unacceptable conditions are the rule rather than the exception. We know that there are now at least 600 political prisoners in Tibet, most of whom are monks and nuns.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last year, we have been able to see, on TV screens throughout the world, the harsh offensive launched by the Chinese régime against the meditation movement Falun Gong since the latter was banned in July 1999. Ever since the ban, tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested. At least 137 people have died in prison. Thousands of cases of torture, atrocities and ill-treatment are also being reported, as is the fact that thousands of people are in work camps and countless individuals have been punished with imprisonment following summary trials. That is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Falun Gong has been branded an evil sect, but one might well wonder if the reason for the hatred felt towards this peaceful movement does not lie, rather, in the threat it constitutes to the Communist system, because it unites so many people. However, Falun Gong practitioners are entirely peaceful and have no political ambitions other than to be allowed to exercise their basic rights – rights which are laid down in the Chinese constitution and in international agreements signed by China.</p>

Parliament’s report states that the protocol can be seen as part of a broader process in which the Union aims to encourage political, economic and social growth as well as stability in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much room for improvement when it comes to the situation regarding human rights in Laos. It is appropriate that human rights there should be discussed at the same time as increased cooperation. We have given a lot of attention in Parliament to the question of Burma. But things are hardly any better in neighbouring countries. Laos is one of the world’s poorest countries. All the negative features of a one-party system are manifest there. There are barely any signs of greater freedom of speech or the liberalisation of political life there. In October 1999, a demonstration was organised in front of the presidential palace against the ruling powers. Those who took part in it have not been seen since. Amnesty says that they were arrested and have been languishing in prison camps without trial. Meanwhile, Mr Thongsouk Saysangkhi, who died in prison in 1998, belonged to a group of three ministers and a high official who had been attempting to change the administrative machine from within. They were convicted of treason.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has tried to aid the development of Laos, despite the human rights problems. The EU has given EUR 120 million in aid to the country; the United States has given 23 million, and Japan 132 million dollars. The Laotian people, who live in dire poverty, need help, but the country’s internal situation gives cause for asking just who is really benefiting from the aid being given. There are regrettable examples of projects where the army and the government have reaped the benefit instead of the local inhabitants. Laos is rich in natural resources and, were there democracy there, would have real potential for development. In a parliamentary statement Laos is being urged to sign, ratify and enforce the UN’s conventions on human rights, to free prisoners of conscience, and to guarantee freedom of the press. The importance of these objectives should really be clearly emphasised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, Parliament requested the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience but this request was ignored and since then at least one of them, Mr Tchongsouk Saysangkhi, has died in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">After 25 years of Communist rule, the people of Laos are today hoping that their country will follow the path of transition to democracy and are calling for free elections. The Laotian Government, however, continues to stamp out any peaceful demonstrations, such as the one held on 26 October 1999 and, more recently, on 17 November 2000. The organisers of the earlier demonstration were arrested and are still in prison. The leader of the second demonstration, Mr Phommachaul Phannolath, was also arrested along with other demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before the House denounces these human rights violations and reminds the Lao People’s Democratic Republic that, as a partner of the European Union through a Cooperation Agreement signed in April 1997, it undertook to promote and protect all human rights. The Lao PDR also showed its commitment to this by signing two United Nations conventions on human rights in December 2000. This commitment must henceforth be backed up with real action.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Lao PDR is taking on the role of coordinator of relations between the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations until 2002. This role gives it further responsibilities in promoting the concepts and values on which the partnership is based. I hope that Parliament will give its support to the European Union’s strategy on the region as well as to all the people of Laos who are working towards democracy and for national harmony within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise resolution is well-balanced, clear and specific. On behalf of my group, I would urge you to support it so that the European Parliament can make its voice heard in this troubled area of the world.</p>

For more than five months hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hemmed in between the warring sides. In the border area between these countries, called the ‘Parrot’s Beak’, they are caught like rats in a trap in fighting between Guinean troops, shadowy rebel movements and the gang of murderers known as the United Revolutionary Front.</p>
<p class="contents">The personal commitment of the new UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Lubbers, in this crisis area is very gratifying. His proposal for the establishment of a safety corridor, which will enable refugees to return to their home countries quickly, deserves international support.</p>
<p class="contents">But, all this is not enough. The causes of this humanitarian disaster must be tackled. For example, it would be a good idea to institute an international boycott against the trade in ‘blood diamonds’, in which this border area is so rich.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that the international community should present a united front against those principally responsible for the present degrading chaos in West Africa - a task in which the Security Council of the United Nations should take the lead. For this reason we request that the Council and Commission should take action along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Charles Taylor originally came to power through violence and terror, with the sole aim of obtaining control of the diamond trade. He later exported violence to neighbouring Sierra Leone by arming and training the RUF, one of the most savage rebel movements on earth and now the Hitler of West Africa is exporting violence to another neighbour, Guinea. Guinea is in a certain sense the victim of the fact that it admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees from Liberia into its territory, including members of the rebel group opposed to Charles Taylor. The Conakry regime has sometimes reacted in a very unfortunate way, but let us not mistake our adversary. Liberia is the destabilising factor in the region. In any case, according to my information it is incorrect that Guinea is refusing to transfer refugees to areas further from the border. The international organisation for migration has in fact already begun moving a first group of 35 000 refugees. It is clear that a safe corridor must be created as soon as possible for the return of these people. Europe could definitely give unconditional support to the ECOWAS plan for stationing observers in the border area. If violence persists, the Union should also call within the UN for smart sanctions against the leaders of Liberia. European Member States that flout the ban on the import of so-called blood diamonds, must be strongly condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, Mr President, I feel that the Council should also investigate reports of possible support from France for the regime in Liberia. The situation is critical. If a Sierra Leone scenario is repeated in Guinea there is a risk that in addition to Central and East Africa, West Africa too will be caught up in a spiral of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, they refused to join the armed forces. I think anyone who has read Ahmadou Kourouma’s book ‘Allah Doesn’t Have To’ will be familiar with the tragedy of the child soldiers forced to join possibly revolutionary but most certainly bloodthirsty armies such as the United Revolutionary Front.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say, like Mr van Hecke, that a safety corridor to allow the mass evacuation of refugees must be established immediately, as it is, indeed, a matter of urgency. The Guinean Government must allow the victims to settle in areas that are further from the fighting and the borders. In my view, that is the least it could do.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it is justifiable and understandable for Guinea to defend itself against any incursion. I am even of the opinion that the territorial integrity of a state like Guinea must be protected. However, the Guinean Government must also prevent paramilitaries acting in the place of legitimate armed forces and perpetrating acts of violence on refugees. I share the view that Guinea is not solely responsible, but I feel that it should do this, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the decision of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to use troops from West Africa must be supported and must come into force as soon as possible, as it may provide good protection.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the European Union should put intense pressure upon Liberia to end its support for forces such as the URF. However, Guinea is also partly responsible for the current situation, and is, even so, a country that regularly violates human rights – no one in the House could forget the imprisonment of Alpha Condé. I believe that it is important to reiterate that, in a country that has no respect for the most basic democratic principles and where the slightest opposition is quashed, it is not surprising, although it is extremely regrettable, that one of the regime’s opposition parties has joined the rebellion and allied itself with the URF.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is to say that Africa is in urgent need of democratic rule and genuine economic development, which will improve the fortunes of all people. We can help to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question to put to the Council. When will our governments cancel the debt owed by third-world countries, knowing as they do that this is the cause of wars and poverty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is nowhere else for the refugees to go. Thousands are hiding in the jungle or are wandering fearfully in the heat without food, water or hope. If a corridor is not quickly created, an unparalleled humanitarian disaster threatens. There is a great deal at stake. The whole region seems to be heading for chaos. The purchase of weapons is more important than feeding people. Above all, Charles Taylor must take Liberia in hand.

Despite having lodged an appeal against her sentence of 100 lashes, the sentence was carried out in January without even her lawyers being informed. They were still preparing the case for her appeal in court. No attempt has been made to bring those who abused and exploited her to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This case highlights the increasing anxiety about human rights abuses in Nigeria. People of different religious beliefs have coexisted peacefully in Nigeria in the past, yet George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on his recent visit to the country, underlined the growing international concern about developments there. The Christian minority are not allowed to build churches or to teach their religion in schools. In areas where Muslim law is enforced men and women are not allowed to travel on the same public transport, and boys and girls have to be taught in separate schools. In the state of Kaduna it is estimated that 2000 people have been killed in fighting between Christians and Muslims over plans to introduce the new Islamic code of law. Yet human rights groups of both faiths are now campaigning on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we have before us sends out two clear messages. The first is that we in the European Parliament are not prepared to ignore human rights abuses anywhere and so we condemn without reservation the treatment of Bariya Ibrahim Magazu and call upon the Nigerian Government to prevent any repeat of such abuse in future. But the second is that we are also making a commitment, as a parliament, to support the creation of a democratic and just society in Nigeria by strengthening the dialogue between ourselves and that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had no contact with her but I separately put down a motion for my own group and I speak on their behalf on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">My good friend Thomas Mann spoke about the denial of the right to practise religion in one part of the world. But it is just as serious when human rights are denied because people want to impose their religious beliefs on other people. Whether it be the imposition of one's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one's religion, one is as bad as the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite hard to be moderate in the language we use to condemn this barbarous and cruel act which took place against a 17-year-old girl in Nigeria. A girl who claimed she had been forced to have sex but failed to produce in court the witnesses to support her claim. The cruelty of the sentence, and the fact that she had given birth one month before, makes it very difficult for us to accept any assurances from the government of Nigeria that they are protecting the civil rights of their people and their own population.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that we in the European Union and the United States of America are the main trading partners of Nigeria. We are the people who buy and sell almost all the things they want to buy and sell. We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with. I would ask the European Commission to take into consideration standards of human rights in all the aid schemes and cooperation schemes that the European Union puts into effect. This is the worst we have heard of to date but we understand there are amputations taking place in Nigeria for relatively minor offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people condemn globalisation, but if there is one good thing about globalisation it means that the world becomes interdependent and we have at least some pressure we can apply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the latest in a whole succession of human rights abuses in Pakistan: growing religious intolerance – which we have just been hearing elsewhere in the world – the lack of a fair trial, so-called honour killings of women, child imprisonment and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I currently hold passport and other details for a constituent of mine, a Pakistani citizen, who has had to travel there for family reasons and in the past has had difficulty leaving that country, even under the previous regime. This highlights the appalling state of affairs that we now see with the present regime in power in Pakistan. The suspension of a constitution, as mentioned in the resolution, and the constitutional court, has removed a crucial safeguard for him and others like him who fear arbitrary detention.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of affairs there appals many Pakistanis, both within the country and throughout the world, people who are proud of their religious faith and who are also committed to fundamental human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Article 18 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Since 1991, Islamic Sharia law has applied in Pakistan. The precepts and prohibitions laid down in the Koran are the supreme law of the land. The law against blasphemy has palpably impaired the largely peaceful coexistence of Muslims with Christians and other religious minorities. Freedom of expression and the freedom of the press have been severely curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, journalists – seven of them this time – have been arrested on the flimsy pretext that they allegedly distributed anti-Islamic writings. It looks once more as if the whole purpose of this is to make a public example of them. But it is far more serious than that, because they could be sentenced to death. We call on General Musharaf’s military government to restore the independence of the judiciary and to delay no longer in allowing the courts to conduct proceedings in accordance with sound legal principles. The Blasphemy Act must be repealed. It is being interpreted in an absolutely arbitrary manner and opens the door to all sorts of manipulation and malicious lawsuits.</p>
<p class="contents">The death penalty is rejected by a great majority of the people‘s representatives, not only in Europe but also in a growing number of Asian countries. It must be abolished. The PPE-DE Group calls on the European Commission to review all its agreements with Pakistan as a matter of urgency and to revise them as necessary. We need cooperation agreements with the human rights organisations and with the regional non-governmental organisations. The paramount aim of our initiatives must be to ensure that Pakistan can at last resume its journey towards a free democratic system of government.</p>

It is, of course, that much more repugnant when journalists are in danger of being executed just for doing their job.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, the newspaper <span class="italic">Frontier Post</span> published a reader’s letter, following which the newspaper’s staff were taken into custody and accused of blasphemy. These individuals’ lives are now at risk. Fundamentalists have set fire to the newspaper’s offices in Peshawar.</p>
<p class="contents">This event is a tragic illustration of developments in Pakistan where freedom of expression and human rights are not respected. The country is now becoming ever more marginalised in the world community. The Islamic laws, like the military’s support for the Taliban régime in Afghanistan, are creating alarm. The situation in Pakistan is very disquieting.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, with regard to China, I would point out that the European Union is steadfastly determined to promote respect for human rights in this area, as in other parts of the world, and that we share Parliament’s concern about religious freedom in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the living standards of the majority of the Chinese population appear to have improved during the last twenty years. Thanks to the economic reforms and to liberalisation, there have been increases in freedom and personal autonomy. It is true, however, that there is still a big gap between the international commitments made by China and the human rights situation in practice. In 1996, a human rights dialogue between the European Union and China was established and, within this framework, we are maintaining a frank debate on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">A key topic is religious freedom, about which the European Union repeatedly expresses its concern faced with Chinese repression of religious and other types of activity to which you have referred. We are talking not only about the Catholic and Protestant Churches, but also about any other type of faith. Later, I shall be talking a little about Falun Gong.</p>
<p class="contents">Other topics raised with China are the repression of political dissent, the arbitrary conditions of detention, the frequent recourse to the death penalty and the repression of ethnic minorities. We are also urging China quickly and without reservations to ratify the United Nations’ International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which we consider to be key factors for improving individual rights. The human rights field is one of the priority areas of our work, in which I believe we can improve our relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">As we very well know, dialogue is only an option, the purpose of which is to produce results. There is no justification at all for maintaining the dialogue if no progress is being made. The European Union’s General Affairs Council openly expressed this point of view in its conclusions concerning the human rights dialogue between China and the European Union, published on 22 January.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred specifically in your speeches to three topics which I think are of interest. Firstly, I should like to point out that, where Falun Gong is concerned, the Commission is especially concerned about the reports we are receiving about torture and ill-treatment inflicted upon followers of the movement, as well as about the severity of the sentences imposed upon some of its members. The Commission has therefore repeatedly urged China to review these sentences. We think that all the safeguards need to be fully respected in fair trials in which adequate defences are mounted.</p>
<p class="contents">As you may know, a decision has not yet been made about the European Union’s position on the Geneva resolution on China. The debate we have held today in this House will, without a doubt, be fundamental to the decision we take.</p>
<p class="contents">As for action in connection with Tibet, we are indeed still concerned about the ethnic minorities there. I should also like to point out, regarding this matter, that China has been urged to make further progress towards fully respecting the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people and to enter into an open dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the situation in Laos, I should like to assure you that the Commission fully shares your concern about protecting human rights in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. It is true that, in the last year, some positive signs have been visible, for example the signing of the two United Nations covenants on human rights: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The problem now is for the National Assembly to lose no time in ratifying these covenants and putting them into effect, and the Commission is waiting for this to happen. Even if this step is successfully taken, however, there still remains a lot of work to be done. A cause of special concern for everyone is the intolerance of, for example, political opposition, as demonstrated by the detention of a number of people in October and November 1999 for demonstrating against the government. You refer in your report to the situation of former civil servants, such as Mr Latsamy Kamphoui and Mr Sackchittaphong, prisoners of conscience who are still being detained and whom the European Union has repeatedly called upon the government to release on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have asked what we are going to do about these matters. I can certainly assure you that the Commission will specifically use the EU-ASEAN meetings as a bilateral context in which to raise all these problems. These meetings will take place in Brussels in the first six months of this year, and we shall be talking about everything I have just mentioned and also about the separate and specific problems you have raised about actual cases of political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Guinea, I should like to point out that we are concerned about the situation in that country, and especially about the ongoing deterioration in the human rights situation as a result of the attacks suffered by the United Revolutionary Front. We fully support CEDEAO’s attempts at mediation. You raised the problem of refugees. The Commission believes that absolute priority should be given to rehousing them in the camps farthest away from the border, that is to say as far away as possible from the combat zones. As matters stand at present, repatriating them to Sierra Leone is unthinkable because two other objectives have priority: reinforcing the camps around Kissidougou, north of Gueckedou, and adapting the access roads to these camps. The Commission is pursuing a two-pronged strategy through ECHO, on the one hand in the framework of the year 2000 intervention plan for Sierra Leone’s refugees through which an amount of more than EUR 2.5 million has already been allocated to the operations in Guinea and, on the other hand, in the framework of the contracts which have been entered into with the associated NGOs and which are being modified to take account of recent events. ECHO is also preparing two funding decisions for 2001: one in favour of Sierra Leone, for EUR 11 million; and the other in favour of Guinea, for between EUR 3 and 6 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Two additional topics commented on during the debate were the responsibilities of Liberia – what can be done? – and the problems in Guinea. With regard to Liberia, I should like to point out that, as you have indicated, the experts’ report from the United Nations on arms and diamonds in Sierra Leone makes it crystal clear what Liberia’s responsibilities are in the conflict. At present, possible courses of action to be taken against Charles Taylor are being debated. What can the Commission do in the meantime? We can use the tools available to us and, with that in view, the possibility is being examined of instituting a consultancy procedure with regard to Liberia in application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. With regard to Guinea, the situation has indeed deteriorated. Recently, the death penalty was imposed upon five people and, as a number of you also pointed out, the subject of Alpha Condé has not been clarified. The Commission passed on the concerns that are felt about this specific matter to a Guinean delegation headed by the Foreign Affairs Minister, which visited Brussels at the end of January.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Nigeria, I should like to point out that the Commission condemns the flagellation of an adolescent in accordance with Islamic law and is concerned specifically about the application of the <span class="italic">Sharia</span> in some areas of Nigeria. The Commission is aware – as I believe you too are – of the fact that the situation in Nigeria is politically very sensitive and that the new, democratically elected government is endeavouring to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria. The Commission and the Member States will be meeting in March to try to reach some common position on Nigeria. The meeting will consider what is the best way to deal with these various topics. In the meantime, you ask what we are able to do. A mission from Brussels is discussing, in Nigeria, how the future programme for that country is to be implemented. The issues of democracy, the constitutional state and respect for human rights will be dealt with as a priority with a view to the decisions that have to be made regarding them.</p>
<p class="contents">The final subject you raised with me was the subject of Pakistan. In accordance with the resolutions you tabled concerning freedom of expression in Pakistan, the Commission acknowledges that the incident which recently occurred at the border post of Peshawar is cause for alarm and especially regrettable in view of the fact that, to date, Pakistan has generally respected the freedom of the press, especially since the military coup of October 1999. It is true that, compared with other countries in southern Asia, its attitude is, or has been, relatively commendable. However, the incident makes it clear that the European Union should remain alert to the issue of freedom of expression in general and freedom of the press in particular. There is the fear that the existence of an independent and diverse press, permitted until now by Pakistan – one of the most liberal of Islamic countries – may be compromised. In spite of the public apologies offered by the editors of the newspaper, <span class="italic">Frontier Post</span>, there is indeed no guarantee that no action will be taken against them. If action is, in fact, taken against them, it will undoubtedly help create an atmosphere hostile to the press in general. We therefore believe it is vital to carry out a very detailed investigation of the incident in order to determine whether possible interests that have not been clearly defined have led to the paper’s being closed down. Apart from all this, the legitimate concern for the safety of the newspaper’s staff is, as a number of you have pointed out, connected with the application of the law on blasphemy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the military government should make a major effort to control religious intolerance in Pakistan and regrets that earlier initiatives to change the blasphemy law were blocked. In the specific political discussions with the Pakistani Government in November 2000, the troika, while congratulating the government on its commitment to respecting human rights and media freedom, indicated that there were still problems in a number of areas, particularly when it came to judicial practices and the restrictions upon the activities of political parties. The troika also took the opportunity to indicate its concern about the concessions being made to a number of groups advocating intolerance. There is no doubt at all that, in the absence of a democratic counterweight, the influence of such groups can increase. That, then, is what the Commission is doing to improve the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prepared to support any actions taken by civil organisations in Pakistan, with such actions to be funded through the European initiative in favour of democracy and human rights. It is also examining the possibility of supporting means to improve public administration in Pakistan, which would be to everyone’s advantage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In an interview the Russian parliamentarian Boris Nemtsov describes a meeting with a young Chechen woman in a refugee camp in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. I quote: ‘She said to me: You Russians are busy exterminating us. You are committing genocide. But you won’t succeed. Because we shall simply outstrip you in population growth.’</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support her assertion Nemtsov’s interviewee told him that a large number of children had been born last year in the refugee camps in Ingushetia. The majority of them were boys, claimed the Chechen woman. ‘And they will all join the partisans later,’ she concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Who except God alone will be able to fully plumb the depths of the suffering of the Chechen civilian population? After a terrible war in the period 1994-1996, for the last eighteen months it has again been the victim of Russian-Chechen hostilities. The fierce, belligerent indictment of these Chechen refugees, can be put in an historical and political context. Remember the horrors that Stalin inflicted on the Chechen people in the 1940s. Such a destructive cry of despair demands a serious political answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Gratifyingly, Boris Nemtsov promises to devote his energies to this. This very month he will present an all-embracing plan of action for the reconstruction of Chechnya. His aims are clear: to offer a real opportunity for the host of Chechen refugees to return home and to prevent Chechen youth from joining the ranks of the ‘partisans’.</p>
<p class="contents">This different, sensible political note from the Russian Federation deserves the moral support of the European Parliament. I therefore respectfully request the Council and the Commission in the forthcoming meetings with President Putin and his government to adopt this peaceful Russian solution to the Russo-Chechen tragedy. Then Chechen and Russian blood will no longer have to flow on such a huge scale in the Northern Caucasus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is also a doctor and a surgeon. I would also like to thank my friend, Mr Bernd Posselt, in particular, for his efforts to ensure that Parliament is at long last adopting a resolution on Chechnya. We should have done so a long time ago, but we have finally got round to it today. I believe that it is a good text and I would also like to stress to my friends and fellow Members in the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the collaboration between all the groups has been valuable. It is not the text that I had hoped for, but I believe that it is a good resolution nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kandief could tell us and has told us, and all the Members who have met him over the last few days, a great deal about cluster bombs and needle bombs, the hospitals that he managed and which were systematically destroyed by the Russian authorities, about the acts of torture committed on the injured and the amputees that he had to look after and about the torture he was subjected to in order to prevent him from caring for the other injured people. I urge you to invite him to your own country to appear on television and speak to newspapers. I believe that his eyewitness account is particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Chechnya is a source of shame to us and to Europe. The events taking place in Chechnya go beyond anything we may have seen in recent years and we have witnessed many tragic events. I believe that the European Union and the Commission have an important role to play. Mr Poul Nielson’s behaviour is unacceptable, appalling even. Not once since war broke out in Chechnya, 18 months ago, has Poul Nielson found time to visit the country to take stock of the tragedy that is unfolding there. in my opinion, this does the Commission little credit. I am not sure if we should have a collection to pay for his plane ticket, but I believe that, unless the Commission changes its policy, Parliament shall soon be calling for his resignation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me make it clear that I want our resolution today to be understood on the one hand as an urgent appeal to the Russian Government to stop violating human rights in Chechnya and to play its part in the initiation of long-overdue measures of de-escalation and on the other hand – and let me emphasise this quite clearly – as an encouragement for those on both sides – Russians and Chechens – who are trying to bring about a peaceful end to this conflict at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, our counterparts in the Council of Europe have recognised the efforts of the Russian representatives – and there certainly have been such efforts – to improve the human rights situation in Chechnya by restoring their voting rights in the Strasbourg assembly. This, however, was done in spite of exhortations to the contrary by human rights organisations. I really do think this was rather an ambivalent signal to send, and I presume that the Troika and Commissioner Patten, who are in Moscow at the moment, will raise this issue with the Russian Government and will call on the Russian side to resolve this distressing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis delivered by the Human Rights Watch on the situation in Chechnya is very alarming. Nevertheless, I assume that those on the Russian side who are genuinely committed to finding a non-military solution to the Chechen conflict will win the day. The facts of the situation have to be faced; the population of Chechnya has already shrunk to half its previous size, and it is time to pave the way for them to live in peace.</p>

Nor shall we permit the Commission and the Council, when they travel to Moscow as the Troika, to make do with a passing reference, between the main course and the dessert, to the murders and torture that are still being perpetrated in the camps and police stations of the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten is there now, so let me ask the Commission what sanctions he has threatened to apply if the Russian Government continues to do nothing to resolve the conflict peacefully, if it is not prepared to engage in talks and to arraign those who are responsible for the violations of human rights. We have ample ground to stand on: we have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have our strategy, and we are unanimous in our view that cooperation must be conditional on respect for human rights. The carrot-and-stick method is the right approach for us, which is why investments in the oil business can only be made on the basis of a peace settlement in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Members of this Parliament, among them Michael Gahler, played a part in the effort to secure the freedom of the Baltic States. I was in the Baltic States at that time too. It was a Chechen, the Soviet general Dzhokhar Dudayev, later to become the first President of Chechnya, who refused to crush the independence movement in the Baltic States. He took this stance in Estonia and Latvia in particular. Thereafter, as we know, the secession of Lithuania was unfortunately a far less peaceful process, thanks to the brutal excesses of the OMON militias.</p>
<p class="contents">And so a Chechen played his part in ensuring that European countries, which will soon be members of the European Union, did not have to undergo the baptism of blood that one or two people had in mind for them. As this example – along with the fact that Chechnya lies within the ambit of the Council of Europe and its Human Rights Convention – shows us quite clearly, Chechnya is not one of those problems on the opposite side of the globe but an essentially European problem. That is why it is such a disgrace that an unholy alliance of deceit and self-deception has been forged. The deceit is partly the product of official government propaganda in Moscow. The self-deception is happening here. It consists in a refusal to register what is actually happening in Chechnya. It is not a matter of the occasional atrocity but of systematic genocide. Mrs Schroedter was perfectly correct when she stated that half of the Chechen population has been murdered or driven out of Chechnya. This is systematic genocide of the Chechen people for the sake of energy resources and geostrategic interests. That is why we must exert intense pressure and say quite clearly to the Russians that the partnership agreement is rooted in human rights. If human rights are not respected, the partnership cannot function. We must tell our Russian partners quite clearly that this is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> in our eyes and that it is high time they started negotiating with the elected representatives of the Chechen people.</p>

It has proved impossible to solve any of the problems by military means, and all parties have been the losers. It is tragic that each side should resort to unacceptable methods in response to the other side’s resistance instead of finally sitting down at the negotiating table and beginning the process of reconstruction. I welcome the commitment of Parliament to respect for human rights in the refugee and prison camps. In a situation where violence is used on a routine basis, our delegations, observer missions and resolutions may be able to ease the problem, but I am convinced that they will not solve it. This is why I believe that one of our priorities will be to help this region to shape a new vision for the future. The first requirement is intensive dialogue. To this end, we should continue to use all the means available to us through our links with the Russian Duma.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweeping condemnations, however, are unhelpful. We shall only be able to make progress in negotiations with the Russians if we take their concerns seriously too. Terrorist attacks in southern Russia and military operations by guerrillas in Chechnya, I am sorry to say, are still taking place. A short time ago, we adopted the Oostlander report, in which we explicitly welcomed the European Union’s twin-track strategy in relation to Russia. The human rights violations in Chechnya must be condemned, but at the same time we must continue to develop cooperation and dialogue. In my opinion, both components of this strategy offer scope for further development.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Chechnya is concerned, however, I am worried. It seems to me that the criticism of conditions in the refugee and prison camps which is voiced by the Council and the Commission, as well as by the governments of the Member States, whenever they meet with the Russians, has become something of a mechanical routine which has absolutely no effect. For that reason I should like to ask the Commission to specify the measures it proposes to take in the immediate future in order to make progress towards a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The medieval warfare against civilians violates everything in which we believe in the European Union and cannot be justified in terms of the terrorist actions perpetrated by certain groups of Chechens. What the Russians are doing infringes a long list of international obligations to which they themselves have signed up. It may well be that we cannot do anything about it. It may well be that it is no use threatening Russia with sanctions and isolation, but here in Parliament, in the stronghold of freedom of expression, it must be said loudly and clearly that we condemn the abuses, the executions, the disappearances, the concentration camps and the systematic oppression of a whole people. We condemn the brutalisation which we are seeing and which offers unpleasant reminders of the past. We urge that the way should now be opened for missions from the UN High Commission, the OSCE and the Red Cross to be permitted to evaluate the atrocities and come to the rescue of the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ought to take account, however, of a number of recent developments. The decisions taken recently by President Putin and the Russian Government with a view to normalising the situation in that republic in the Northern Caucasus are certainly worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kadirov’s former provisional Chechen administration has become permanent. Control of the security forces is now in civilian hands. A substantial reduction in the troops stationed in Chechnya is planned. It is also worth mentioning that the Federal Government has announced a substantial increase in the resources to be devoted to rebuilding Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these hoped-for improvements, the present situation is indeed still causing great concern. Reports are still being received stating that members of the security forces have violated human rights. The Russian administration is certainly not following up these reports properly, despite the efforts made by the office of Mr Kalamanov, presidential representative for human rights. To give you an indication of the inadequacy of the response, the number of cases taken to the courts can be counted on the fingers of one hand and, as far as we are aware, not a single sentence has yet been handed down.</p>
<p class="contents">Some essential steps have been taken in the judicial area. A number of district and central courts have been set up, and over twenty judges have been trained and appointed in Chechnya. However, for the practical benefit of these measures to be felt by the citizens, greater cooperation on the part of certain authorities is called for, especially the military prosecutors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made repeated representations to this effect to the Russian authorities and my colleague Commissioner Patten is raising the matter again in Moscow today. I am sure that on his return he will be very well placed to update you on this matter which is of particular concern to you as indeed it is to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the Commission is continuing to provide political and material support for Mr Kalamanov through the TACIS programme. It must, however, be noted that no agreement has been reached concerning the technical conditions to allow the immediate return of the OSCE support group to Chechnya. We are working with the Romanian Presidency on this matter. We still aim to have the support group back in the field as soon as possible, but in reasonable conditions of safety and with unrestricted freedom of movement within the Chechen Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">I could also mention the need to improve the conditions relating to the provision of humanitarian aid. This involves travel permits and the possibilities for communication. However, we are all very familiar with these issues and I do not think it is worth dwelling on them.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that the situation seems to be improving, although a very great deal remains to be done. We have yet to see the extent to which and how soon the Russian authorities implement the measures they have announced. In this regard, it has already been stated that troop reductions will be effected as the military situation allows. This is worrying, because the reduction may be slower that we hope for. Nonetheless, these measures are essentially positive and it is to be hoped that they will enable a permanent political solution to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Russian Government recognised the need for a political solution in the joint declaration made after the last summit with the European Union held in Paris last October. Pending such a solution, the Commission will continue to seize the opportunities offered by the many regular political contacts with the Russian authorities to convince them of the need to investigate violations of human rights in Chechnya more thoroughly and efficiently. We shall also urge them to prevent such violations and, if appropriate, to punish those responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In paragraph 4 of our resolution, we point out that some buildings in this region were weakened by structural faults.

It is not only India that has been stunned by events. The pictures of the devastation in the State of Gujarat are etched in all our minds: one hundred thousand killed and several hundred thousand forced to leave their homes which have been completely destroyed – these people are now homeless, destitute and without work. I have been struck by the scale of the rapid response from the international community and the donations from private individuals. What fine examples of humanity and solidarity in an increasingly unfeeling world. Special teams, including several from Europe, were on hand to pull survivors out of the rubble. Help is flooding in. Medical supplies, food by the tonne load, clothing, blankets, installations to help provide clean drinking water and also prevent the outbreak of typhoid, cholera and hepatitis. Row upon row of tents have been erected to provide essential, albeit makeshift, refuge against the bitterly cold nights. This is all a source of comfort to the earthquake victims and their family members, many of whom reside in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has generously released EUR 13 million in emergency aid and there is a good chance that this aid package, distributed via the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office to six international aid organisations, will directly reach the earthquake victims. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will also be involved in achieving the successful reconstruction of the region. The damage to property alone amounts to over EUR 3 billion. And what actions have the Indians themselves taken? They have set up a committee, supported by all parties, dedicated to active disaster management. The authorities have acted quickly despite a series of aftershocks. The electricity supply was restored within days and towns were able to get back on their feet as streets and squares were cleared. We should applaud the efforts of our Indian friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, as we all know, Portugal has one of the lowest levels of GDP per capita in the European Union and the forecast made by the Commission in its second report on economic and social cohesion estimates that last year, Portugal moved even further away from the real convergence that it had experienced since 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that the European Union provides exceptional aid in order to address the damage that has been done and to make its contribution to the huge effort that is currently underway.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Commission, together with the Portuguese Government and local authorities, to provide exceptional financial aid to complement the resources that have been made available by the Portuguese authorities in order to meet the urgent needs of the communities that have been most badly affected, and to facilitate the rebuilding of infrastructure that has been destroyed and the resumption of economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">A reallocation of appropriations that have already been earmarked is not enough. I repeat that what is needed is exceptional aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost every single river in Portugal burst its banks and there are towns in my country which have suffered four consecutive floods in the course of this winter with the rains that have fallen since November.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis was felt particularly acutely in the centre of the country, affecting the Mondego basin most tragically, but it affected communities to some extent throughout the country. The Portuguese authorities and the civil defence forces have made huge efforts to remedy the situation. Now, questions about reconstruction are being asked and I would add my voice to those of my fellow Portuguese Members in asking the Commission to work together with the Portuguese authorities at national and local level to aid reconstruction, to list the damage done and to support the reconstruction of the areas that have been affected with both financial and technical resources. I should also like to express my solidarity with the victims. Given the scale of the floods that have swept across our country this winter, and let us hope that they are over, because the bad weather is continuing, we must once again draw your attention to regional planning policies and to the need to ensure the balance of our ecosystems. In this matter, I would also ask for the assistance that would result from dialogue with other Member countries of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen enormous material damage, families made homeless, injured and even killed. Once again, an appeal to European solidarity is being made in this Parliament and it is the Commission’s duty to find ways of putting this into practice. The Commission must not hide behind a lack of funds – the people who have been affected do not want to hear administrative excuses. It is our duty to prove that Europe is not only a generous idea but also an efficient organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two fundamental issues that are worth recalling. The first, broader issue is that of environmental protection and climate change. Only a few years ago, anyone who mentioned these matters was dismissed as being utopian, alarmist and even a little mad. Today, the evidence is clear for all to see and we have to act effectively to prevent the situation throughout the world from deteriorating. The second issue concerns my country, Portugal. Let no one be in any doubt; I do not intend to give in to demagogy: my country’s government and local authorities are not responsible for the rains that fell, but they do have a responsibility from which they cannot shy away. They must show greater rigour in regional planning and greater resistance to urban speculation, they must refuse permission to build in areas at risk from flooding and establish better management of river beds and dam outlets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all work together, not only in order to help the people who need urgent assistance, but also in taking precautions with the measures and actions that predict and reduce the probability of similar disasters in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have caused a genuine disaster. In requesting the support and the solidarity of the European Union, we are not trying to solicit an emotional reaction; we do not want to give the impression that we are courting pity or that we are merely asking for help. The Portuguese Government has not failed to provide support for the areas that have been affected and there has been no lack of national solidarity. Financial support from the European Union, however, is just as important for Portugal as it is for the European Union itself. In fact, even more important than the material size of such a contribution is its symbolic, moral and emotional effect. Strengthening the sense of belonging to the European Union and the awareness of European citizenship also requires these small, symbolic gestures and brings Europe closer to the people. The communities that have been affected by the storms and the population will, in general, feel that the European Union is not indifferent to their tragedies and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the best way for the European Union to touch people’s hearts, regardless of how much it contributes. This is why we are asking the Commission to use its imagination and to provide an answer to our request and to our proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This decision, like all emergency decisions, enabled operations to be funded from the first day of the emergency. Its objective was to provide immediate aid not only through the distribution of blankets, clothes, medicines and health care and the provision of food and drinking water, but also through the creation of a field hospital in Bhuj.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Mann has pointed out, this operation involved our collaborating with six humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam UK, Care International, the German Red Cross and Save the Children in the United Kingdom. Each of these organisations concerned itself with a specific area of activity and, in our opinion, the results have been positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now announced its decision to provide a further EUR 10 million. We expect this decision to be finalised in the course of next week, as soon as the priorities have been established and assessments have been made of needs on the ground and of the NGOs’ proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to current, and any future, aid that we avoid duplication in the use of resources, as well as the problems which might be created by types of urgent need not covered by one or other financial aid provider. It is therefore vital to deal with all aid opportunities together and, in order to fill the gap between emergency and long-term aid, the Commission will lose no time at all in sending a study mission to assess reconstruction and renovation needs <span class="italic">in situ</span>. This mission will work in close conjunction with the Member States, and its results will enable us to decide better how to carry out future initiatives in cooperation with other international institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the specific problem of floods and natural disasters in Portugal, I can tell you that Portugal has certainly suffered a very hard winter. There have undoubtedly been problems in many regions of Europe, involving heavy rain and storms, together with floods which have caused considerable material damage and, in certain cases, the loss of human life as well. On 16 November 2000, I myself appeared before this House to comment on the extremely serious floods in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France and Italy, and I should like once again to express the Commission’s concern about these matters. We wish to be associated with the demonstrations of support and solidarity addressed by this House to the victims of this new disaster, specifically in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as 31 January, my colleague Michel Barnier used the occasion of the part-session in Brussels to express his openness towards any request from the Portuguese authorities to re-adjust the programming of the Structural Funds. When we talk about re-adjusting the programming of the Structural Funds, we are not, as some of you may possibly have thought, talking about applying a different use to the same resources as previously existed for the country but, instead, of reconsidering the overall programming of the Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to remind you that, on Wednesday, 25 October 2000 before this House, Mrs Wallström, speaking on behalf of the Commission, specified the latter’s role in the field of civil protection and explained the opportunities offered to us by the current Budget in terms of how the EAGGF and ERDF Structural Funds might be deployed, together with the Interreg 3 Community initiative which, in its inter-regional chapter, includes cooperation in the field of natural or industrial disasters. There is no other room for manoeuvre within the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the ‘Community Action Programme – Civil Protection’, the Commission is therefore prepared to consider a project to be submitted by the Member State affected, aimed at identifying the areas at risk from flooding in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like once again to remind you of the Commission’s concern and of its willingness, within the framework of what is at present possible, to respond promptly and positively to the requests which Portugal might, under this general heading, submit as a consequence of these events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Wogau (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to deal with why we have tabled this issue regarding decisions in Ireland. I believe that it should be considered that we have reached a new stage in the development of the European Union and in the integration of the economies in the European Union. Today twelve Member States make up a Common Market with a single currency. A domestic market in the original sense. It is imperative that economic policy in this European domestic market is drawn up in accordance with common guidelines. In this respect, we are pleased that the European Commission and the Ecofin Council have taken action in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first time that a decision regarding one of these Member States has been taken in this way and this decision concerns the stability of the European currency. As you are aware, in all debates in this House my group has repeatedly granted the utmost priority to the stability of the European currency and we shall continue to do so in future. We believe that a stable currency is one of the key building blocks for a social market economy and that this is also necessary for the European currency. Let there be no doubt that this shall remain a priority for us in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would ask whether the European Commission and the members of the Ecofin Council have picked the right target for this, the first decision of its kind. Ireland is without a shadow of a doubt one of the European Union’s model children. It is questionable whether other countries are in the position to reduce their deficits. Ireland achieves surpluses. Other countries still have a huge total debt of over 100% while at the same time Ireland is in the process of reducing its debt to under 40% and so can likewise be held up as a model for other European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">While other countries are battling unemployment, Ireland has made exemplary progress in this regard with the creation of new jobs. While other Member States are battling with slow economic growth, Ireland is enjoying growth rates that other Member States can only dream of. It should be said, however, that the Irish economy is overheating as a result of this strong growth and that, consequently, there is a risk that this could be to the disadvantage of the Irish people. For example, if I take rent and property prices in Dublin and compare these with those in Frankfurt it becomes quite clear that the development of these prices also has a detrimental effect on the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect clearly something must be done. The question is, however, who shall take the action? Should it be the European Union who intervenes or is this a matter that should and can be settled by Ireland, the Irish Government or the Irish Parliament themselves? This then raises the question: who should be responsible for European economic policy in the future? We must work towards ensuring that this responsibility is set out quite clearly. We must be clear on who is responsible for what, so that where there is success praise may be given and where there is failure, which may also occur, we are able to say that a particular country or a particular institution is at fault. A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union. The European Union is without doubt responsible for competition, the competition between businesses in the European Union. As Commissioner Mario Monti has demonstrated time and time again, the European Commission takes this task very seriously indeed. The European Commission is also responsible for currency stability, on the one hand through the strong European Central Bank and on the other hand through finance ministers, charged with monitoring the stability and growth pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability. Responsibility for taxes, on the other hand, still undoubtedly lies with the Member States of the European Union. The same applies to social security systems and education. This then raises the question: what is happening with currency stability or, more precisely, have occurrences in Ireland jeopardised currency stability within the eurozone? Just imagine a different situation. Imagine that the inflation rate in Germany stands at 6 or 7%. As Germany makes up one third of the gross national product in the eurozone, this would instantly lead to a sharp increase in the average inflation rates in the European Union, to such an extent that the European Central Bank would be forced to spring into action and thus the economy would be curbed. Ireland is however a small economy with a gross national product little above that of west London. The overheating of the Irish economy has no influence whatsoever at a European level, so there is no need for action at the level of the European Central Bank. Ireland no longer has the opportunity as before, when the Irish Central Bank could raise interest rates, of contributing to the deceleration of the economy. Therefore, Ireland must themselves be responsible, also for the Irish people, for reducing the overheating of the economy somehow or other. How this is to be achieved I leave up to the Irish. I do not wish to raise this at the level of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, turning to my second question. On 12 January a decision was made by the European Commission to pay EUR 401 million to Ireland. EUR 726 million in supplementary funds followed, funds that were also pumped into the Irish economy. In this regard I would like to ask whether a conversation took place between Commissioner Solbes and Commissioner Barnier with a view to resolving this obvious contradiction. In other words, what is happening in Germany, in France and in Italy gives much more cause for concern regarding the stability of the euro. I hope that the European Commission will have the same courage, when it comes to dealing with these large countries.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, I should like to thank Mr von Wogau for having raised a subject I believe deserves to be debated. His approach was correct when it comes to the way in which this matter is to be reflected upon, and I shall try to follow his line of reasoning.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin at the end, with the question of why our decisions do not in any way affect transfers of resources. Why are we talking about the coordination of economic policy? We are talking neither about problems of regional policy, nor of competition, nor of taxation, nor of any other such factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make an initial remark so that we are all familiar with, or are clear about, the model we have agreed in the Treaty of Maastricht, according to which the coordination of economic policies is based on a tool, known as the broad economic guidelines, approved each June by European Councils at the proposal of the Ministers of Finance. This is the basic document for economic policy coordination, and one with which you are very familiar because you have had occasion to discuss it more than once in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This document includes decisions of a general kind, together with decisions aimed specifically at Member States and containing practical recommendations which – I want to emphasise – are unanimously approved by the European Council. Obviously, the document also includes the points of view of each and every one of the Member States which sign the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain a proper balance between fiscal and monetary policies, the Stability Pact is, of course, implemented alongside the broad economic guidelines. As a result, we may sometimes have the impression that, as in the case of Ireland, actions are taken which may be difficult to reconcile with observing the criteria of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important to say first of all that Ireland has met the requirements of the Stability Pact and continues to do so, with more than enough room to spare, and that the Irish authorities deserve every kind praise for pushing ahead with their structural reforms and running the public finances well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Irish economy has continued to grow very strongly in the year 2000, but also true – and we are now coming on to the first point you raised – that it is overheating. Is overheating important in terms of a balanced overall picture? I have no intention whatsoever of getting into whether each specific measure is or is not correct. Such measures are the responsibility of the Member States, and I have no objections to make. We are talking about general, overall positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Overheating of the Irish economy is not a new problem. It dates back to 1998 and had already been revealed in the broad economic guidelines. It was also revealed in 1999 and again in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2000 – and I am referring here to a decision adopted by the European Council, proposed by the Ministers of Finance and applicable in every Member State – it was stated that, given the further overheating of the economy, budgetary policy had to be used to ensure economic stability and that the 2001 budget ought to be managed with that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">What are, so to speak, the contents of the 2001 budget? I believe that knowing this may help us to clarify two issues: what is the reason for the concern of the Commission, firstly, and of the Member States, secondly. I shall quote two facts from the 2001 budget: the fact that the current expenditure approved in the budget assumes a 1.06% increase in Irish Gross Domestic Product, and the fact that tax is to be reduced by 0.57%. As a result of these two factors, total demand is therefore being stimulated to the tune of 1.6% of Irish Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another fact I think is interesting on the subject of the broad economic guidelines we were talking about. The message is to seek or maintain a balanced budgetary policy and, if necessary, to have a somewhat more restrictive budgetary policy designed to offset any difficulties Ireland might have as a result of a monetary policy which is defined for the eurozone and is, logically enough, too expansive for Irish conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">If, for example, we analyse the figures which we normally use to see how economies behave and which show the main impact on the cyclically adjusted surplus, we see that, whereas in 2000 the figure was a budgetary increase of 0.4% of GDP, in 2001 the figure was 0.9%. This matter is certainly being discussed by the Irish Government and the Commission. The former believes that the figures we have calculated show an additional 0.3% increase. On the basis of the figures provided to us by the government – and this is the topic under discussion in Eurostat – we are able to arrive at somewhat different figures. That is why, in the recommendation, we effectively acknowledge this situation and refer to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">I would turn now to a third factor. An important topic when it comes to the behaviour of economies is the way in which supply operates in relation to demand and whether the growth in demand is more rapid than existing supply. In technical terms, we measure this using what is called the potential output gap, which shows the amount by which demand is growing in excess of supply. In 2000, the potential output gap was 4.5%. In other words, Ireland was demanding 4.5% more than what it was producing. In 2001, that figure has risen to 5.4%. We are therefore talking about a very expansionist budgetary policy, at a time when the Irish Government has committed itself, in terms of the broad economic guidelines, to a budgetary policy which, in principle, ought to be more restrictive with a view to offsetting the other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the second point which you raised and which I think is especially interesting: the fact that the Irish economy is relatively small and its impact on the eurozone minimal. That argument makes sense and might lead us – like many economists – to conclude by asking why, if we did not have any other types of commitment, we should take action over Ireland if that country does not affect monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that, in connection with this argument, we ought to be asking ourselves two related questions. Firstly, can we treat the Member States of the European Union unequally? And should some Member States be able to do what they themselves consider appropriate while others cannot, according to whether they are smaller or larger countries? The second important point is that we could discuss whether that is the model to be applied in the future. But in any case, that is not the model we are applying today in accordance with current legislation. It is therefore absolutely vital, at least from the Commission’s point of view, that, if we are to fulfil our role as guardian of the Treaties, we should apply the Treaties in the form in which they exist at present.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the Commission did what it considered its duty, which was to send a recommendation to the Council of Ministers in accordance with the provisions of Article 99(4). I very much emphasised the fact that, when I speak of a recommendation, I am not referring to sanctions. I appreciate that, from the media’s point of view, it is much more appealing to talk in terms of sanctions. When we speak about recommendations, we are indicating to the Irish Government that the budgetary policy it has defined is inconsistent with what they agreed and will lead to additional problems concerned with the overheating of its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement, we put a figure on the recommendation, saying that we considered there to be 0.5% overheating. That is something we can discuss. The figure will vary depending upon the methodologies we use. On that basis, it is obviously for the Irish Government to do what it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s position was presented to the Council of Ministers, which approved it by consensus. That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment and, like yourselves, I believe it must be accorded due importance because, if it is indeed an important milestone in applying our model for coordinating economic policies, we ought not to attempt to draw conclusions of a kind which the Commission never of course intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, Commissioner, when we in Ireland signed up for economic and monetary union, we accepted the central tenet of economic and monetary union, namely closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The key elements in this process are the stability and growth pact, which is at the heart of economic policy coordination. Secondly, we have the annual, and I underline annual, broad economic policy guidelines – a lesser known element of the economic policy development process.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as European-wide, there are country-specific guidelines identifying policy priorities and particular circumstances. Commissioner, I was listening carefully to see if I could extract from what you said precisely what breaches of the country-specific guidelines Ireland is guilty of to warrant the recommendations of the Ecofin Council under Article 99 of the Treaty, last Monday, at your behest. Our finance minister, Charlie McCreevy, told the Irish Parliament this week that he had no problem with advice to Ireland setting out the Council's view of the appropriate policy mix to achieve economic stability. But he felt this view should have taken the form of an opinion, as in the normal course, particularly in view of the comparative performance of the Irish economy relative to other EU Member States. An opinion, Commissioner, rather than a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response? Would not an opinion have sufficed, given the very heavy political fall-out from the recommendation in Ireland, where we are in an election year and very likely face a referendum on Nice, this episode has been oats to the eurosceptics. And the same applies elsewhere, particularly in the United Kingdom. There is also nervousness about the Commission's involvement in tax policy generally in the post-Nice situation. This latest episode does not help. I fail to see why Ireland's transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully, more diplomatically, with more understanding – both by you, Commissioner, and indeed by our somewhat maverick, though genial, finance minister.</p>
<p class="contents">To many observers it appears to have been in the end about egos and macho behaviour all round – all in the context of an economic turnaround in Ireland in the last six to seven years that is the envy of many. The charge is that Ireland is to seek to achieve economic stability and, in that context, our last budget was deemed to be over-inflationary.</p>
<p class="contents">There are occasions when "a one size fits all" economic model does not fit. The biggest threat to Ireland at the moment is wage inflation fuelled by 75,000 job vacancies. Securing the continuation of social partnership with our unions, employers, farmers and government and, through it, wage moderation has to be a priority for our government given its huge contribution to our economic success over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that a 10% increase in the GDP per annum is not sustainable, given the pressure on labour supply and house prices. But even IBEC, our employers' confederation, has said that our budget must be understood in the context of social partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to point to one single factor that has contributed more than any other to the turnaround in the Irish economy, I would have to cite the Social Partners' Agreement which allowed us to trade competitively in the single market and to attract inward investment because of the stability it brought to wage negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the unseemly public debate over the censure, the lack of diplomacy in handling this issue by both sides and the very negative political fallout that has ensued. Time does not allow me to run the numbers of Irish economic success. I have no doubt my colleagues coming after me will do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Irish Government's response to the European Commission and to Ecofin has been arrogant and reckless. Reckless, because it has needlessly damaged the standing of Ireland in the Union and because it feeds xenophobia in Ireland by putting in doubt the possibility of the Nice Treaty being ratified. Reckless, because it feeds Eurosceptism in the UK and Denmark and it cannot be in the long-term interests of either Europe or Ireland for either Denmark, the UK or indeed Sweden to remain outside the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore the stance taken by the Irish Government. I believe that its position is being driven by the growing Eurosceptism in the two minority government parties. For example the Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Mary Harney, recently indicated her preference for the American economic model rather than the European social model, stating we are closer to Boston than Berlin. I do not agree, however, with the MEP from the PPE-DE, Mr Werner Langen, who is quoted in the <span class="italic">Irish Independent</span> newspaper today as saying that Ireland should be further penalised by the withdrawal of cohesion funds. Such a step would be a gross overreaction as well as being illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call again on the Irish Government to accept the Ecofin decision and to sit down with the Commission to discuss how it can best be implemented. I would also call on the Minister for Finance to accept the long-standing invitation from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of this Parliament to come and talk to us and explain the Irish position in detail, so that we can understand it and learn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Irish Parliament this week, the Minister for Finance outlined five main points on which he claimed he was at odds with the Commission and Ecofin. He claimed that the Commission recommendation and the Ecofin decision are unreasonable, unwarranted and a misreading of the Irish economy. He stated that the Irish tax cuts made over the past three years have been contractionary, not inflationary. He said that the Irish budgets have not been procyclical as measured by the Commission's own calculations. He stated that the Commission methodology overstates fiscal loosening this year because it does not take into account once-off factors such as a shorter fiscal year in 2001 and he stated that an opinion would have been a more appropriate step than a reprimand. The Commissioner has dealt to some extent with some aspects of that case. I would like to hear Commissioner Solbes address this House today in detail on those points so that we can have some clarity as to the issues that are actually in dispute between the Irish Government and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, growth increased by 10 per cent. Unemployment is less than 4 per cent, and the country also has a genuine budget surplus. The impoverished Emerald Isle has turned into a Celtic tiger. The EU has therefore been too hasty in issuing a warning to Ireland, since the situation of the country is being disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is a small country dependent upon foreign trade and with an economy closely linked to the British and American economies. The falling rate of the euro has therefore had more of an impact upon Irish inflation than upon that of other EU countries. Inflation has fallen from 6 per cent in November to 3.9 per cent in January, and there is everything to indicate that it will continue to fall. The Netherlands now has higher inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you yourself stated, Commissioner, Ireland’s policy cannot jeopardise the way in which EMU operates. It is in this connection that you refer to Article 99 of the Treaty, and it is then that that argument falls down. Ireland accounts for only 1 per cent of the EU’s total GDP. For Ireland, the threat of inflation is mainly from external sources, but the EU and yourself are demanding internal measures to get inflation down. The EU’s action is politically unwise and does not increase confidence in the EU and EMU, above all in those countries which are at present outside the eurozone. I want to conclude by asking Mr Solbes Mira why he did not give Ireland more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, we have in the past shared and we still share the concerns that smaller countries have regarding the abuses that could result from excessive arrogance on the part of higher authorities or larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, we consider the decision by the Commission, exercising for the first time its right to reprimand with regard to the specific situation in Ireland, as totally unjustified and, at any rate, as a remarkable blunder given the number of Eurosceptics criticising European integration. We believe that it is totally unjustified, first of all, because the admittedly high level of inflation in Ireland may also be related to the specific nature of the Irish economy, which imports not just its oil but also most of its spare parts from two countries, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, who, over the last few years, have significantly revalued their currencies in relation to the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that there is no evidence at all that the 2001 budget is “pro-cyclical”; quite the opposite, the American air pocket and American slump risk making it an extremely counter-cyclical budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is that although tax reductions by the Irish Government are, admittedly, too high, this issue should have been tackled at the time when, for years, Ireland carried out fiscal dumping by lowering company taxes, thus attracting companies from the continent. It is absolutely incredible that this criticism should be made when the reduction in tax affects citizens rather than companies.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the topic of our debate and say that I welcome the opportunity that we have to give our views on the significance and impact of the decision that the Commission, then the Council, have taken to use for the first time the Treaty of Amsterdam provision in order to address not a sanction, Commissioner, but a public reprimand to a Member State, in this instance, Ireland, as well as to severely rebuke several other countries for not complying with all the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that this will provide many people with food for thought regarding the liberal logic of the current economic and monetary union, just months before the euro intrudes into the everyday lives of 300 million European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the others, I do not question the principle of such warnings which are the logical corollary of the coordination of economic policies. On the other hand, I denounce the underlying attitude. The guardians of monetary orthodoxy in the European institutions are obsessed with the idea of excessive public spending, excessive spending on social provision. They have no consideration for the shameful inequality that still exists in the social model that the European Union claims to represent; nor do they have any consideration for the need to promote the human skills necessitated by the information revolution, which is developing at lightning speed before our very eyes and which really has yet to take off.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that health spending, in particular, was specifically targeted in the Commission’s criticisms of various Member States, one of which was France. On almost the same day, the Commission decided to bring a case against France before the Court of Justice since it was guilty of charging the lowest income families a lower rate of VAT on some of the price of electricity and gas. Over-restrictive measures of this kind are not the way to survive the crisis of confidence that citizens are experiencing towards European Union institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to the public comments made by Mr Prodi regarding the criticism of Ireland which, up until now, has been presented as a model of success. When the President of the Commission said that sometimes, the schoolmaster must punish even the best pupil, he revealed a stunningly original perception of the new European method of governing. I am counting on the great debate on the future of Europe, which has everyone talking, not to focus on abstract institutional reforms alone but to be based on actual experiences such as those of citizens in the countries which have been targeted by the harsh criticism of the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, first of all I want to thank you for chairing this session and also to thank the Commissioner for coming along. Tight control of budgetary spending since 1987, alongside a strong model of social partnership where the unions, employers and government came together, are two of the main planks of the present success of the Irish economy. Alongside this, our intention and our commitment to investing in education and in building up infrastructure and in particular to utilise the new opportunities in information technology are the further elements of this success.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland we have a commonly used phrase – "if it is not broken, why fix it". Our present growth rate at 11% is over three times the average of other Member States. We have a budget surplus of nearly 5% of our gross domestic product. Our debt/ GDP ratio is only 39%. Tax and expenditure levels at 33% make Ireland one of the lowest tax regimes in Europe. We have a binding commitment to provide 1% of our annual gross national product to meet our future public pension bills. Indeed the latest figures show that inflation, as measured on the harmonised European basis, in Ireland has now fallen to 3.9%. This rate of inflation is lower than in several of the larger Member States within the EU, if a comparison is made on the latest available economic data, for example, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind the European Commission that before the recent economic success in Ireland, the Irish people were required to make major sacrifices so as to guarantee that economic growth could take place. Ireland does contribute and wants to continue to contribute to the positive development of policies and programmes within the European Union. Ireland will shortly become a net contributor to the European Union budget where previously it was a net beneficiary. As well as that, Irish waters are opened up to European fishing fleets to ensure the continued success of the European fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the economic recommendations, which would help to improve the Irish economy, should be listened to and taken heed of. However, on this occasion, I believe that the European Commission has misjudged the special nature of how the Irish economy operates. Moreover, I do not think it fully appreciates how far we have travelled in actual terms in the improvement of our economic performance. I will give to the Commissioner a list of figures to put it into context. In 1991 the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty were agreed by EU leaders, and the green light was given to the operation of the single currency. Ireland's GDP in 1991 was IEP29 billion. It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion. In 1991 we had to borrow IEP760 million to keep public services going. Today we have a budget surplus. In 1991, 1.15 million people were in our workforce. Today we have 1.67 million.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to specific events of recent weeks, I believe that any mention of financially reprimanding Ireland, which is being suggested in some quarters, would be a highly regressive step. Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination. Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories. The European Union has prospered in a spirit of cooperation between various Member States working together, pursuing common political interests. The EU will not prosper into the future if confrontation is the order of the day. I am elected to represent the people of Ireland, and I and my colleagues in this Parliament will continue to represent what is in the best interests of the people of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the holding of this debate on this occasion is very welcome. We welcome the opportunity to shout from the rooftops how proud we are of our performance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone comparing the macroeconomic indicators of the EU Member States, cannot escape the conclusion that Ireland is at present out in front. The criticism by the European Commission of the policy of the Irish Government therefore seems very strange. But on closer inspection it is nevertheless correct. Given the overheated state of the Irish economy, there is unmistakable evidence of a pro-cyclical policy when the Irish Government lowers taxes and increases government spending. And if Ireland is not given a reprimand now, it will be very difficult to criticise the policy of Member States in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile it remains striking that a small Member State should be attacked, while the economic reforms and performance of the large EMU Member States in general lag behind. Could Commissioner Solbes Mira indicate if he is aware that the criticism of larger Member States in the present recommendations seems to be couched in more friendly terms than in the case of smaller countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When it was decided to launch the Economic and Monetary Union back in the spring of 1998, I pointed out to the Commission the precarious situation regarding retirement provision in some Member States. Your predecessor, Mr De Silguy, simply refused to listen. I now notice that the Commission is voicing cautious warnings about this, addressed particularly to France and Italy. The ECB also expressed itself in disturbing terms on the subject in its monthly report for July 2000. If policy continues unchanged the burden of pension contribution will go through the roof in most Member States. In the case of one Member State to as high as 20% of GDP, maintains the OECD. Remarkably, the present election campaign in this Member State is being fought on tax reduction!</p>
<p class="contents">The longer the Member States concerned delay in tackling the pension problems energetically, the greater future budgetary problems will be. There is a financial time bomb ticking away. Meanwhile the Commissioner is still not speaking unambiguously. Surely it cannot be acceptable for necessary reforms to be repeatedly postponed, thus passing burdens on to future generations?</p>
<p class="contents">I expect you, at the forthcoming spring summit in Stockholm, to set out the rules and specifically warn the Member States Italy, Germany, Spain, Belgium and France. On this point Ireland has everything well under control. It would be opportunistic to conceal this. Because in the future Ireland, the Netherlands and others will be directly or indirectly burdened with the consequences of problems that their EMU partners knowingly and wilfully left unsolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is disproportionate because Ireland seemed rather like the good pupil in the European classroom and its level of inflation, which, at the end of the day, really is fairly low in absolute terms, does not threaten to destabilise the whole eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, why demand restrictive measures which might have a harmful effect on Ireland? In order to explain this, you have to look at the analysis of the new single monetary system, in which small adjustments achieved by varying exchange rates are replaced by a rigid single currency system, supplemented by strict procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, adjustments through markets are replaced by centralised, administrative adjustments. Is there any guarantee, however, that this new administrative process will produce better results than the market process? We do not believe that this is the case. The only guarantee is that an economic policy that does not suit all countries will be forced onto the various Member States. This rigid system may have disadvantages which, in the long run, will cancel out the presumed advantages of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still one question that has not yet been resolved. Is this compulsory unified policy one that has been determined by the larger countries for their own benefit and to the detriment of smaller countries, or could it one day perhaps backfire on the larger countries themselves? I have no pat answer to this question. At the moment, Ireland might well believe that it is part of the first scenario i.e. that it is a smaller country being sacrificed to the interests defined by the heavyweights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the question is more complex because, behind the condemnation of Ireland, there are larger targets in the firing line and France is, perhaps, the prime target. The point is no doubt to set a precedent for, or even to reinforce the idea of, referring to the multilateral surveillance procedure under Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that it can be extended to other Member States in the future. The process of constraint is, therefore, far from over. Europe’s disciplinary role may first affect the smaller Member States, but it may, in future, have an effect on everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both of them are saying to us that you do not have the right to grow, but you do have the right to spend.</p>
<p class="contents">To take the first point: you do not have the right to grow. Here we have a Member State, Ireland, which has an impressive budget surplus, an extremely small budget deficit, a very high growth rate and a level of inflation which, while it is too high, particularly because of reasons beyond its control, nonetheless respects the major part of what we said must be respected in the stability pact, Yet you are telling Ireland that growth is not a good thing, despite the fact that it has respected the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz is telling us that we must have the right to spend. I would point out to you, Mr Wurtz, that that is not the case in Ireland. Ireland does not spend excessively. It has strong growth precisely because of the fact that its spending is not excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on France, on the other hand, was to make a token gesture and issue a minor reprimand, but to state that the situation there is quite acceptable. Yet, I note that France patently does not respect its commitments. France had undertaken to reduce its public spending and to make tax cuts. This imbalance has been upset. We can see that the trend of reducing budget deficits is slowing down in France, whereas growth is becoming stable. We can see that France has the highest level of public spending of all the countries in the eurozone. We can see that France’s national budget is being used to fund spending on the wages bill, which, logically, ought to belong to the market economy. None of this is satisfactory but you do not say anything, because France, like Germany and Italy and other countries, is too big for you to handle.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, concerned, Commissioner, because  and I am not blaming you  in order to have a real ‘policy mix’, you need to be bolder, politically speaking, to be better armed, legally speaking and to be equipped, economically speaking, with rather more complex analytical equipment than we have at our disposal. In fact, in this matter, we are suffering from a lack of Europe rather than an excess of Europe, and it is the smaller countries that are taking the rap for this deficiency! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not know when or how the Commission and the Council would be able to use this procedure in Article 99, and paragraph 4 in particular, if not on this occasion. Imagine that they had to do this next year. I do not think that would be possible. They have both been guardians of the Treaty as well as guardians of the general interests of Europe. As a consequence, economic policy coordination has not yet been achieved. Commissioner Solbes Mira has just presented a document that has been adopted by the Commission and which we shall study very closely; in other words. It is a document which will enable us to forge ahead in those areas. We would like to thank him in advance and we hope that we will be able to improve the system on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps what we should be criticising is the gap between BEPGs in the budget, rather than the recommendation that the Commission has just drawn up. When BEPGs, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, are set out, everyone is gathered around the table – Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, and so forth. The issue that we are coming up against today is that once BEPGs have been adopted, everyone goes home again and adopts their own budget, almost completely forgetting what was established collectively, among equals. The problem today is that the Commission is dismissing a budget that the Irish Parliament has already adopted and it is assessing the outcome of internal debates held in Ireland, France, Germany and Italy after the fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, like to congratulate the Commission once again for having adopted this resolution. Mr von Wogau wonders if the Irish economy may really has such an impact on economic and monetary union. Of course it does not, but you must go back to Article 99(4). It says that the Commission must make these recommendations and the Council must adopt them when the proper functioning of economic and monetary union is in jeopardy, and also when the economic policies of the Member States are not consistent with those that have been defined collectively. This is certainly the current scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the question or whether a large or a small country should have been reprimanded. Do you think that one day the Commission could have criticised a larger country which was sending out negative messages that might weaken economic and monetary union if it had not previously responded in this way to a smaller country? – I still do not know the difference between a larger and a smaller country, but never mind. – I do not believe so and I therefore welcome the decision taken by the Commission on Monday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we cannot be absolutely sure of that, of course, since meetings are held behind closed doors and sometimes also behind a smokescreen. Only very exceptionally, when things are really getting out of hand in one country, does Ecofin open its doors, does the smokescreen lift and does the colleague concerned get a public reprimand. This week, Ireland became the first country to suffer this fate. Are things going so badly with the Irish economy then? Can we really not trust the Irish? Not at all. On the contrary, Ireland is doing well, as has already been mentioned by many speakers. For five years Ireland has enjoyed an average growth of 5%, with unemployment down from over 16% to scarcely 4% and a budget surplus of over 4.5%. Admittedly there is a threat of the economy overheating and there is a risk of inflation, and that was not within the framework of the agreements made by the ministers themselves. But all in all it is not strange that the Irish should feel harshly treated. However, much greater risks lie in wait. The possible next Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, has announced that he wishes to lower taxation despite a budget deficit and despite a ratio of public debt and gross national product that is more than three times the size of Ireland’s. What we wonder is whether the Council of Ministers will administer a public reprimand here too. Commissioner Solbes Mira, though we have doubts about the necessity of taking Ireland to task, in the latter case you can count on our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The freedom of an elected government to frame its own budget in accordance with its electoral commitments is fundamental to democracy. I therefore urge Ireland's Minister of Finances not to renege on his promises to increase spending, on health in particular, and to lower taxes, especially for the lower-paid. I hold no brief for tax cuts for the wealthy, nor is this a budget that would be proposed by the Green Party. Nevertheless it is a programme that has been negotiated with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has particular difficulties with inflation because of its traditional ties of trade with the UK, which remains outside the eurozone. This is an aspect of Irish inflation which has been completely ignored by the European Commission. In fact, if the European Commission had deliberately decided on a course which would alienate the UK from joining the euro, by revealing itself to be an out-of-date bureaucracy which tries to bully elected governments in ways that are completely outside its brief, it could not have done better. This is absolute political stupidity to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">This interference with the Irish budget is the result of the Maastricht Treaty; the Commission is even trying to get governments to agree their budgets with it in advance, which was not part of the Treaty. I therefore anticipate a resounding rejection of the Nice Treaty in the Irish referendum this Summer because of this unwarranted interference and because this is a very bad treaty, as many in this House agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1994 the cumulative increase in employment has been 39 per cent. Today the economy is close to full employment, which is a huge sea change for Ireland. Irish unit labour costs are still more than 10 per cent below the eurozone average. Therefore both wage rises and tax cuts for the low paid are on the agenda for Ireland in 2001. I believe the Commission is deliberately trying to interfere in a field beyond its competence. We must not let this happen.

I encouraged Mr von Wogau to table this question because I believed that Parliament would treat this important precedent in a fair and balanced way – and indeed it has. Furthermore, I recognise that everything discussed in the Commission was in secret and everything discussed in the Council was in secret. And we had to accept the press releases from the propagandists when it was all over. So, at least in this House we have an open and democratic airing of the whole subject, and I welcome that very much.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we speakers from Ireland forgot to say was how much the European Union has contributed to the success we have. I do not want to go into all the details, but I want to mention one factor that is underestimated, which is the way that the Irish economy – being small and open – responded to the internal market. It is no coincidence that Ireland took off the day that borders were abolished in Europe and we got a free market. That was important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money. A Commission study, when Ireland had an economic growth rate of 10%, showed that the transfer of structural funds to Ireland only contributed 1.5%, if that. So the people who say that Ireland has grown on handouts from Europe are exaggerating.</p>
<p class="contents">What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister. He was told this by the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute, just as the Commission told him. He was told it by the Irish employers' association. He was told it by the central banks. And if he had a problem with it – with the trade unions demanding increased wages – it was because his policies had already stoked inflation and had already undermined their real incomes. Even if we were not in the Union and in Monetary Union, we would still be affected by the decisions taken by the European Union. In that sense, there is no such thing as sovereignty for a small, open economy like Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The minister is reputed to be a sportsman. A sportsman should have obeyed the referee when he blew the whistle when somebody broke the rules. Even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong, for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I would like you to answer the following questions: how do you think the Irish economy can be cooled down when the rate of inflation in Ireland is higher than the interest rate set by the European Central Bank and, therefore, money in Ireland is very cheap? You and your colleagues, Commissioner, know that, in the United States of America, there is a difference in the rates of inflation between the various states. This does not necessarily affect the stability of the dollar, however. Why should this situation, in the case of Ireland, whose economy only represents 1% of the European Union’s GDP, be crucial to the stability of the euro? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the Stability Pact several times, but not once did you mention the Growth Pact! I would say that stability is important if there is to be growth, and I would give the example of Ireland, which has been a Member of the Union for twice as long as Portugal and Spain. Nevertheless, it has already shown such high levels of growth that it has reached the Community average. This makes me wonder whether the Commissioner would not also like to consider the possibility of not seeing the Maastricht criteria, particularly inflation, as his Bible and whether there are not other, more important aspects for him to think about in order for Europe and all the countries in Europe to grow at a healthy pace? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree, which precisely raises the question: "Why bother?" I accept that, as a Commission, you have the right to do what you did. As Guardian of the Treaty, you have the duty to act, if you believe that is correct. I accept that Ecofin endorsed the judgment of the Commission.

<p class="contents">I do not question your right, Commissioner, to do what you did, but I question your judgment. I believe it was the wrong judgment in the context of such an important precedent-setting example. I believe the Irish response was the wrong response because it was too petulant. I believe both the Commission and the Irish response to the Commission's recommendation lacked proportionality. Two wrongs do not make a right.</p>

As I see it, there are good reasons for supporting the Ecofin Council’s recommendation. The economic policy guidelines, on which all EU Member States have agreed, are concerned basically with ensuring that we do not once again slip into the galloping inflation and devastating budget deficit of the Eighties, which subsequently led to a backlash in the form of crisis and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland is the first Member State which is now seriously beginning not to meet its inflation targets. Against the background of the crisis in the Nineties, it is therefore perhaps only reasonable for the EU to react. Now, things are beginning to go well for Europe again. No-one begrudges Ireland its fantastic growth. On the contrary, it is of course one of the foremost examples of EU cooperation’s really being able to help substantially improve conditions for an individual Member State. However, that is why we must not forget our experiences of the crisis during the Nineties. We must not compromise on our conviction that the fight for growth and full employment can, and must, be allied with a clear acceptance of responsibility when it comes to price stability and a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, can Ireland not be allowed to go its own way? The problem is that we of course live in an interwoven, internationalised economy in which developments in one country influence developments in the others. As long as only <span class="italic">one</span> small country infringes the guidelines it has itself accepted, the problem may seem small. Now, however, there are worrying signs that more countries may be doing this, in which case it will be important to send out warning signals early on.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, an attempt is now being made to feature the criticism made of Ireland in anti-euro propaganda. Just look, they say. If we take part in EMU, we shall lose our economic independence. The EU will even obtain power over our taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that propaganda of that kind is nonsense. Ireland has been criticised not because it is to reduce taxes, but because the reduction is to take place in a situation in which this may contribute to overheating and to inflation’s taking off again.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has issued a recommendation. No forcible means are to be used to take over Ireland’s tax and budget policies, despite all that is maintained by Swedish opponents of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tried to clarify a number of points in my initial speech, but I have a feeling that I did not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are not judging Ireland against any other country. We are judging Ireland against its own commitments, accepted in accordance with the broad economic guidelines. Secondly, we are not taking a decision that has just come out of nowhere and which was not anticipated. The Council’s 1998 recommendation already referred to the need for a stricter fiscal policy for Ireland. In the 1999 recommendation, a reminder was issued that, in spite of the efforts made, these were still not enough and, in 2000, after it was pointed out that the budgetary policy adopted by Ireland needed to be more restrictive, there followed a clear expansionist budget on Ireland’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about an expansionist budget, I am talking about overall figures. I have no quarrel with more health expenditure or more expenditure on reducing tax. Those are policy matters to be decided upon at national level. As Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, my concern is with the overall status of the Irish budget. However, it is not only <span class="italic">my</span> concern but also that of Ireland’s Central Bank, which I assume is familiar enough with the situation of the Irish economy and clearly understands that the current budget gives a substantial procyclical boost to the economy. That is the situation, and these are the facts we are judging.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, we can talk about what we are, or are not, to do. My duty as Commissioner responsible for these matters is to apply the broad economic guidelines, which are compulsory in a way that the Stability Pact is not. The Stability and Growth Pact – to answer Mrs Torres Marques – was decided upon following a Community regulation. The broad economic guidelines are the model we duly agreed for inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht. And what we have done is to apply this model strictly, as required. In contrast to what some believe, it is obviously not a position of the Commission. Rather, it is a position of the Commission and the Council. Nor, in making our proposal, did we proceed on the basis of any factor other than our own assessment of the point at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">No one should therefore imagine that there are motives or problems of any other kind, large or small. We are talking about consistency with the model we had duly established.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to a greater degree of understanding. I believe that we have been showing understanding since 1998 but, in this situation, decisions obviously need to be taken at some point.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to the lack of diplomacy on the part of the Commission. I can assure you that none of the leaks that have appeared in the press come from my department in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it may be thought that the best pupil in the class is being punished. As I have said, it is not a case of our imposing sanctions. We are using a recommendation to highlight an example of incorrect behaviour in the light of the economic policy guidelines. And this is not inconsistent with good behaviour in terms of growth and inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">We could talk in much more detail. Mr Bradbourn intimated that not enough data had been provided. I am prepared to appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, whenever you think it appropriate, to comment in more detail on all the data we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 99(4) – which is one of the things you are concerned about – applies in accordance with the provisions of current legislation. There has been discussion about whether the censure of Ireland is or is not justified. In my opinion, it <span class="italic">is</span> justified. If it were not, this proposal would not have been made. Moreover, it is justified in spite of the limited impact Ireland has on the overall European economy. Clearly, there are – and I repeat – two reasons why I think the censure is justified: firstly, because of the obligations accepted by everyone in terms of the model we have defined; and, secondly, because I do not believe that anyone can seriously defend the view that, in terms of the model we have implemented, a country can be treated unequally on the grounds that it is large or small.</p>
<p class="contents">We can talk about other subjects which have also been raised: the problems concerned with Ireland’s contribution to European growth, specific problems, the development of inflation etc. I think that all these technical subjects can be discussed. It is true that nominal inflation has gone down in the last two months in Ireland. Nonetheless, when we talk about the overheating of the Irish economy, we are talking about underlying inflationary pressures, the operation of underlying inflation, the increase in salaries, the increase in the cost of living and many other factors fundamental to any correct assessment of what is happening in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Is our approach wrong? Here, we are embarking upon a subject that is difficult to assess because it is necessary to ratify the Treaty of Nice and because it is a factor that will impact upon other models. I would ask you whether you believe that policy assessments of this kind exempt the Commission from its duty to apply the Treaties in the forms in which they are established. In my opinion, the Commission has acted with sufficient prudence after having repeatedly urged the Irish Government to take a different course. The Commission presented the matter to the Group of Euro Countries and to the Economic and Financial Affairs Council. The decision was not approved by chance. The matter was debated by the special group of the Economic and Financial Committee after each and every one of the arguments put forward by the Irish Government had been analysed. And, in spite of all that, the decision was taken, as I have just said, on the proposal of the Commission and, so to speak, with the assent of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission did what it had to do. I would again emphasise the significance of the term, ‘recommendation’. I am not talking about a sanction but about a recommendation, and I believe that we cannot draw any conclusion which takes us farther away from the content of that Council decision suggested by the Commission, namely to apply a standard which is there in the Treaty for the purpose of resolving a series of practical problems raised in the model we have established for coordinating economic policy. Although a different model may apply in the future, that is the one that is in force today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council and Commission are working closely together to tackle the current problems on the beef market. Decisions taken in recent weeks include action in the public health arena to restore consumer confidence and market measures aimed at reducing the impact on farmers.</p>
<p>It is the Commission's task to propose further market-related measures, such as the measure which the honourable Member proposes. At its meeting of 29 January 2001, the Council welcomed the Commission's intention to submit a package of measures, before the next Council meeting, towards resolving the problems caused by the imbalance on the EU market in beef, both short and long term, while at the same time improving quality on that market.</p>
<p>The Council will consider these measures promptly within the framework of the budget agreed at the European Council meeting in Berlin.</p>
<p>As you will be aware, on 12 February 2001, the Council drew up the proposal for supplementary and amending budget 1/2001 for the funding of a package of measures relating to BSE, which was agreed by the (agriculture) Council at its meeting in December. The package includes measures for additional costs of EUR 971 million, EUR 726 million of which are made up of funds from the margin available under sub-heading 1a of the budget. Those EUR 726 million will be entirely covered by the surplus from previous years. The remaining EUR 245 million are obtained from adjustments to the estimates of agricultural expenditure as a result of an adjusted euro/dollar exchange rate in line with Article 8 of Council Regulation 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 on budgetary discipline.</p>
<p>The Council has also noted and welcomed the seven-point plan presented by the Commission yesterday. The Council hopes that the Commission will soon submit the proposals officially so that it may begin to consider them and draw its conclusions. The European Parliament will, of course, be consulted in accordance with the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0063"></a>

<p>In crossing Western Sahara without the prior authorisation of the Western Saharan government, the organisers of the Paris-Dakar rally risked in an irresponsible and criminal way contributing towards bringing about a resumption of the fighting in a conflict which has still to be settled after 25 years. The event gave backing to the Moroccan Government which claims sovereignty over Western Sahara in defiance of international law. The cease-fire which has held since 1991 is now fragile. The situation could flare up at any moment and degenerate into war, destroying all the efforts made to achieve peace and harming the country's future for a long time to come.</p>

<p>The extension of the mandate for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), approved by the UN Security Council, expires on 28 February, without the mission having fulfilled its established aims.</p>
<p>Given that failure to implement the peace plan in full may lead to a renewal of hostilities and instability in the Maghreb region, does the Council not take the view that, with the threat of military confrontation in Western Sahara looming, the European Union ought to take urgent steps to enforce the concept and policy of conflict prevention approved in Nice?

<p>Because they are similar in character, all of the questions relating to Western Sahara shall be answered at the same time.</p>
<p>The Council fully supports the United Nations Secretary-General and his personal envoy, James Baker, in their endeavour to find a solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. The parties are urged to continue their efforts, under James Baker’s supervision, to solve the countless problems in implementing the UN’s settlement plan effectively and to agree upon a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>All the parties have approved the principles behind the UN process. The Council is therefore convinced that this process constitutes the best framework for a lasting solution which would also strengthen the stability of the whole region. Every possible solution must be based upon full respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights.</p>
<p>The Council is willing to contribute actively to this process and help bring about a climate of trust and confidence between the parties concerned which can facilitate a settlement. In close consultation with James Baker and through contacts with the countries’ representatives in New York, the Council has, in this spirit, urgently called upon Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario to put a number of humanitarian principles into practice by returning prisoners of war and allowing visits from relatives. The Council has emphasised the importance attached by the EU to confidence-building measures, especially those based upon the latest report by the United Nations Secretary-General. As a result of these approaches, 201 prisoners of war were released, and there was a positive response regarding visits by relatives. We hope that the United Nations’ Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross will be able to arrange such visits.</p>
<p>The EU also addressed the question of Western Sahara at the first meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council in October and at the Association Committee’s meeting in Rabat on 6 February 2001.</p>
<p>Finally, I should like to emphasise that the European Union is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to refugees from Western Sahara. EUR 20 million was paid out through the Commission’s ECHO office between 1999 and 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0068"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member states, at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, the European Council emphasised that the transition to a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based economy was especially important and urged the Council and the Commission to draw up an action plan for eEurope in order to exploit this opportunity to the full. The action plan, drawn up by the Commission and the Council and adopted by the European Council at the Feira Summit in June 2000, includes measures for greater Internet safety and the development of a coordinated and uniform approach to Internet-related crime before the end of 2000.</p>
<p>The European Union has already adopted a series of measures to combat damaging and unlawful material on the Internet, to protect non-material copyright and personal data, to promote electronic commerce and the use of electronic signatures and to improve the security of transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently submitted a communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions under the heading of ‘A Safer Information Society – Safer Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime’.</p>
<p>The various alternative measures available to the EU for combating computer-related crime and referred to in this communication are based upon the study’s analysis and recommendations, the conclusions from the consultation process, the new opportunities offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the work that has been done within the EU, G8 and the Council of Europe (which is expected to complete its work by producing the Convention on Cyber-crime this year). At Community level, the solutions chosen ought not to mean that the internal market is impeded or fragmented, nor should they entail measures that undermine the protection of basic rights.</p>
<p>The House ought also to be reminded that, for a long time, the EU has supported projects aimed at promoting the safety of information infrastructures and electronic transactions and at increasing public confidence in these. Research projects and operational projects aimed at promoting the special training of staff in crime-fighting organisations, together with cooperation between crime-fighting organisations and industry, have also received support within the framework of the programmes within the third pillar; for example Stop, Falcone, Oisin and Grotius. The Swedish Presidency is arranging three seminars this year on these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0072"></a>

<p>Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) play a very important role in support of infrastructure projects in the South and in Eastern Europe. During the 1990’s, ECAs’ financing through loans, project guarantees and investment insurance averaged USD 80-100 billion per annum. Roughly 60% was channelled in support of energy-intensive projects: fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas development, transportation, etc. While a few – most notably the US Export-Import Bank – weight environmental impact in deciding whether to make loans, most do not. This means that taxpayers’ money is being used to subsidise investments in carbon-based technologies. Given the seriousness of the climate problem – and EU commitments to the Kyoto Protocol – it is remarkable that so little attention has been paid to the critical role played by ECAs.</p>

<p>According to a report which has been drawn up by Barcelona University as part of the ‘Farewell to Arms’ campaign (whose participants include Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Intermon and Médecins sans Frontières) and which concerns the criteria for granting or withholding authorisation in respect of arms exports, 42% of Spanish arms exports contravene the criteria laid down in the EU’s relevant code of practice. In particular, weapons are allegedly being sold to countries which violate human rights, which are involved in conflicts, which are subject to UN embargoes or sanctions or which resell weapons to third parties. These facts are serious ones which reveal the Union’s inconsistency in this area and undermine its international efforts to secure peace and protect human rights – and which are regarded by the author of this question as totally unacceptable. Is the Council aware of this situation? Is it intending to contact the authors of the report in order to seek their opinions?

<p>The European Union's position on arms exports is reflected in the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports adopted on 8 June 1998. According to the operative provisions of the Code, "each Member State will assess export licence applications for military equipment made to it on a case-by-case basis against the provisions of the Code of Conduct". Decisions on whether to grant an export licence are consequently taken by each Member State individually and it does not lie in the Council's purview to exercise any judgement on such individual decisions. The Code itself and the increased dialogue and exchange of information concerning national export policies are expected to contribute to a convergence of the arms exports policies and procedures of the European Union Member States. The annual assessment of the functioning of the Code which is reflected in the annual report is an important step in this process.</p>
<p>The second annual report which has been adopted by the Council and published in the Official Journal confirms that the Code has ushered in a new degree of transparency between governments in the area of arms export policies and has enabled the Member States to enter into dialogue when considering national arms licensing decisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0079"></a>

<p>The honourable Member is reminded that policy towards minority and regional languages is to be considered, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as falling primarily within the responsibility of Member States. However, the Council fully recognises the importance of the linguistic diversity of the EU, as exemplified by the Council's conclusions of 12 June 1995 on linguistic diversity and multilingualism in the European Union and, more recently, by the fact that the European Year of Languages 2001 (jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council) is aimed at the promotion of language learning in general, as is clear from article 1 of the Decision designating that event. The Council has, moreover, noted the Commission's call for proposals during 2000 for measures to promote and safeguard regional and minority languages and cultures (OJ C 266, 16.9.00, p. 15) and would also examine with interest any future proposals submitted by the Commission in this context.</p>

From this moment on, it will be the joint responsibility of the European Parliament and the Council, as co-legislators, to ensure that aeronautics research is given its due importance under the forthcoming Community RTD Framework Programme.</p>
<p>In examining the Commission's proposal, the Council will, of course, be taking into account the significant developments in the global and European air transport market, as set out in the Commission's communication "The European Airline Industry: from Single Market to World-wide Challenges", on which the European Parliament adopted a resolution in May 2000.</p>
<p>The Council has also noted with interest the report of the group of 14 personalities from Europe's air transport sector, submitted at the Hamburg Aeronautics Days which calls for a "European Strategic Research Agenda in the aeronautics field, firmly based on the concept of sustainable development". The Council recalls that the underlying objectives of the Community's RTD programmes are the improvement of the scientific and technological basis to enhance industrial competitiveness and provide support to other Community policies, based on the principle of sustainable development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0108"></a>

<p>1.	The EU and the Member States are fully aware of the difficulties many poor countries, and in particular the least developed ones, face because of their excessive debt which affects their development prospects and undermines their political stability and progress towards democracy. The EC development cooperation places a special focus on the situation of the least developed and other low-income countries. In the joint declaration of the 10th of November 2000, the Council and the Commission confirms the overarching goal of EC development cooperation: the reduction – and eventual eradication – of poverty. This objective entails a determination to eliminate inequalities and support a gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy. In this context, the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC) is of outmost importance.</p>
<p>2.	In order to alleviate the debt burden, the EU and the Member States have actively taken or participated in initiatives at various levels, in conformity with their competencies.</p>
<p>-	On 6 July 1998, the Council decided to participate fully in the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) initiative launched by the IMF and the World Bank. This initiative was based on a commitment by the international financial community to reduce countries' debt burden to a sustainable level, provided that the country completes a period of strong economic policy performance.</p>
<p>-	At the Cologne Summit in June 1999, Ministers agreed to an "enhanced HIPC initiative that will provide faster, deeper and broader debt relief".</p>
<p>-	The European Council of Cologne in 1999 highlighted the importance "of finding a lasting solution to the debt problems of the poorest countries. The European Council welcomes the common European position on improving the debt initiative for heavily indebted poor countries and supports a faster debt reduction process for the poorest countries and ambitious aims as regards the extent of debt remission. It emphasises the debt relief should be more closely linked with a strategy for poverty alleviation. The Member States are prepared to support an increase in the remission percentage on commercial loans to 90% or more at the Paris Club and will seek to promote further reductions for debt from official development aid. Within this framework, with appropriate burden sharing, Europe is ready to bear its fair share of the cost of an improved debt initiative."</p>
<p>-	At the annual World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington in September 1999, the donor community took an ambitious set of political decisions closely linking poverty alleviation strategies, structural adjustment programmes and the debt reduction initiative.</p>
<p>3.	Following these decisions, the EU-ACP Joint Council decided, in December 1999, that unallocated programmable resources from the EDF might be used in the form of grants for meeting the outstanding debt and debt servicing obligations to the Community of the first ACP countries which qualify under the HIPC initiative (EUR 320 million), and for contributing to the overall financing of the HIPC initiative by providing up to EUR 680 million for the HIPC Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.</p>
<p>	In July 2000, the EC disbursed the first tranche of the contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund amounting to EUR 250 million to the African Development Bank. In early September, the EU disbursed from its budget its contribution of EUR 54 million to the HIPC Trust Fund in favour of eligible Asian and Latin American HIPCs.</p>
<p>	Similarly, a first payment of EUR 100 million was made at the end of 2000 to the Special Trust Fund established with the EIB to alleviate the burden of debt owed by the ACP HIPCs to the Community in the form of special loans and risk capital.</p>
<p>	The mobilisation of the remainder of the up to EUR 1 billion contribution to the HIPC Initiative will depend on actual needs and contributions from other donors.</p>
<p>	The EC stresses that debt relief is closely linked to the aim of poverty reduction: decisions and completion points of the enhanced HIPC initiative now depend on the definition of Poverty Reduction Strategy papers, to be elaborated and initiated by the beneficiary countries.</p>
<p>4.	In the framework of the Africa-Europe Summit in Cairo, 3-4 April 2000, a number of Member States announced their willingness to write off most, if not all, debts of HIPC countries.</p>
<p>	Additionally, at this summit, parties:</p>
<p>-	agreed "to support African countries in channelling the amounts of resources from debt relief to poverty eradication strategies and programmes, including in social and infrastructural sectors."</p>
<p>-	reaffirmed the commitment to achieve the globally agreed target of poverty reduction by half by the year 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0110"></a>

<p>The Council is aware of the permanent evolution of agricultural structures in the European Union following the implementation and subsequent Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in a competitive international environment and the rapid evolution of science and technology in a society more and more concerned about environment protection, food quality and sustainable development.</p>
<p>The decrease in employment in the agricultural sector in average terms is the natural consequence of this evolution and, to a certain extent, it represents a positive trend allowing a better use of the production capacity through sustainability of family farms following the European model of multi-functional agriculture. The Common Agricultural Policy until now was indeed capable of following this process in an orderly manner and of ensuring a reasonable comparability of average income from farming activity with other economic sectors. In many cases, the decrease in agricultural employment in primary agricultural activity was followed by an increase in employment in the area of transformation and processing of agricultural products.</p>
<p>With the recent adoption of Agenda 2000 reform, the Council has started to drive the traditional Common Agricultural Policy from organisation and protection of markets into a new rural development policy taking into consideration not only the traditional agricultural activity but also encouraging alternative economic activities in rural areas through facilitating investments for the maintenance and reinforcement of viable social fabric in rural areas, the development of economic activities and the maintenance and creation of employment with the aim of ensuring a better exploitation of existing inherent potential and the removal of inequalities and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women, in particular by supporting projects initiated and implemented by women.</p>
<p>Of course, setting up schemes to help young farmers, to support vocational training and to implement early retirement schemes also contributes to the turnover between generations and to the improvement of the occupational skills and competence of farmers and other persons involved in rural activities.</p>
<p>According to Regulation 1257/99, it is up to the national authorities to implement those measures and elaborate programmes and projects ensuring the cofinancing of such opportunities.</p>
<p>The Council pays great attention to the simplification of the application of the Common Agricultural Policy, in particular to making the administrative burden easier for farmers to get the FEOGA payments which represent a substantial share of their income. The Council is, at present, considering a proposal of the Commission for the modification of certain provisions of Regulation 1259/99 establishing the rules for direct support schemes under the Common Agricultural Policy on which the Parliament European has been consulted and which would introduce a simplified system for paying limited amounts of direct aid to small farmers for a trial period under necessary controls.</p>
<p>The Council is politically committed to conduct a mid-term review of Agenda 2000 by the year 2003, on the basis of Commission reports. It will, of course, devote all its attention to any new Commission proposal to increase employment in agriculture, or to promote increased agricultural incomes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0113"></a>

This report made reference to the fact that some Member States are having to store material pending an increase in their rendering or incineration capacity and that other Member States have to export SRM to neighbouring States for processing.</p>
<p>In cases where the sudden increase in material for destruction has meant that existing processing facilities are insufficient to cope with the volume, it is reasonable and unavoidable that Member States should store processed and unprocessed material pending an increase in their capacity. Providing that this storage is under official control and is performed in a hygienic manner, there is no reason that it should pose a risk to health. Similarly, the export of high risk material to other Member States for incineration is provided for in Community legislation and is subject to strict monitoring by Member States of origin and of destination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0012"></a>

<p>Recently the British Government decided to distribute an information leaflet with each mobile telephone sold warning mobile phone users, especially young ones, of their potential health risks, since to date there is no scientific certainty as to the likelihood of health risks for users, or their extent.</p>
<p>The studies carried out by the Commission on the effects of electromagnetic radiation from mobile telephones on human health did not reveal any negative effects, but in spite of this some additional information is needed to reassure the public. In addition, as of September it has been compulsory in the USA for all telephones to be labelled with the radiation levels they emit. In view of the above, does the Commission intend, in order to ensure a high level of consumer protection and on the basis of the precautionary principle, to require manufacturing companies to label telephones with radiation levels or to issue some warning as to the possible harmful consequences on the brain of the use of these telephones by very young individuals? Does the Commission plan to publicise the results of the studies it has funded and, with a view to transparency, to provide information to European citizens on a regular basis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member raises the important issue of how public health and new technologies interact as regards in particular the expanding use of mobile telephones. Let me first say that over the past 20 years, there has been an important research effort under the leadership of the World Health Organisation’s electromagnetic fields project. The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection has also been involved in this project to look for evidence of adverse health effects from the exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>The Council Recommendation of 1999 on limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields is based on the guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, which were endorsed by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Eco-Toxicity and the Environment. The Committee stated that these international guidelines provide the appropriate basis to develop exposure limits against public health risks.</p>
<p>Regarding long-term effects, the best available scientific knowledge does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that long-term effects occur as a consequence of exposure to electromagnetic fields. However, taking into account the growing public concern of long-term effects of such exposure and the rapid development of the telecommunications sector, the limits set up in the Council Recommendation include an additional safety factor of about 50 to the threshold values defined by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection for the general public. In this way, the Recommendation would cover possible long-term effects in the whole frequency range. As a result, the guidelines in the Council Recommendation provide protection thresholds with respect to adverse health effects which may be caused by exposure, taking into consideration the variety of possible physical characteristics and exposure scenarios.</p>
<p>In order to cover any new scientific findings and to ensure that the scientific basis, on which the Council Recommendation is based is still valid, the Scientific Steering Committee will give an up-dated opinion in June 2001.</p>
<p>To ensure a uniform level of protection throughout the European Union, the Commission has mandated the standardisation bodies (CENELEC and ETSI) to work on establishing European standards, including harmonised methods of calculation and measurement. This will enable verification that the safe exposure limits set in the Recommendation are met. A first standard for mobile telephones is expected to be available in June 2001, and other standards will follow.</p>
<p>Research efforts on electromagnetic fields and their effects continue at international level. Within the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development (Quality of Life programme, Key Action “Environment &amp; Health”), the European Commission funds EUR 9 million of research on the potential carcinogenic effects of radio frequencies. The Commission is supporting the largest study ever conducted on possible carcinogenic effects of electromagnetic fields. This study is coordinated by the International Association for Research on Cancer (IARC). Results are expected by 2004. This research is directly applicable to the protection of the public and will lead to strengthening the scientific basis for the establishment of exposure limit values.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0082"></a>

<p>The use of insecticides based on imidacloprid (Gaucho) and fipronil (Regent), both of which are highly toxic to bees, is creating a disastrous economic situation for French beekeepers.</p>
<p>The situation is particularly serious as in the areas where the insecticides are used bee stocks have been decimated. These insecticides also cause serious environmental damage which must be considered as a matter of urgency. Imidacloprid and fipronil enter the soil and contaminate harvests from one year to the next, even if seed has not been treated. Furthermore, the disturbing bee mortality rate could pose a risk to the flora-fauna equilibrium.</p>

<p>The use of plant protection products in the Community is governed by Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market. The Directive stipulates that the evaluation of the active substances should be done at Community level but that the specific evaluations and authorisations of products containing evaluated substances should be done by the Member States.</p>
<p>The active substances fipronil and imidacloprid were already on the market at the entry into force of the Directive and therefore they have to be re­evaluated at Community level. These active substances are included respectively in the second and third phase of the review programme for existing active substances. For both active substances industry has committed to submit a dossier in order to demonstrate that there are acceptable uses in accordance with Article 5 of the Directive. The Commission will report to Parliament and the Council next July on its progress with the re­evaluation programme.</p>
<p>Member States can only grant authorisations provided that the plant protection product, when properly used, does not have, inter alia, an unacceptable effect on the environment. As part of this assessment the impact on non­target insects, including honeybees, has to be evaluated. If necessary, appropriate risk mitigation measures such as use­restrictions need to be put in place.</p>
<p>For imidacloprid, the damage to bees resulting from use on sunflowers has not been proven but, since the currently available scientific evidence is not conclusive, the French authorities have suspended the use of imidacloprid on sunflowers. An epidemiological study will be carried out over the next 2 years. The Commission is not aware of similar problems in other Member States.</p>
<p>For fipronil the French authorities evaluated recently new information which did not show concerns on honeybees.</p>
<p>The Commission will follow further developments but does not intend, in view of the currently available information, to ban the use of any of the substances mentioned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0128"></a>

<p>The remarks attributed to the Member of the Commission concern the treatment of animals in a Community abattoir. No export refunds were payable in respect of these animals.</p>
<p>Animal welfare is an increasing social concern. Animal transport is the area that probably receives the widest public attention.</p>
<p>The Community has a key role to play in improving the conditions in which animals are reared, transported and slaughtered. The necessity to limit the transport of the animals over long distances only when it is really necessary, and to keep any suffering to a minimum, is an especially important objective.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted in December 2000 a specific report on the implementation of existing Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport. The report concludes that Member States have clear difficulties in fully applying Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport. It must be pointed out that national authorities did not give the necessary priority to this area of Community legislation during past years.</p>
<p>Rules on animal protection during transport are there to be respected, just like any other law. The Commission will not tolerate the shortcomings in implementation found in the Report.</p>
<p>Animal welfare and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport is a priority for the Commission and it should be the same for Member States. In this framework the Commission is studying possible solutions to replace the transport of live animals by the transport of meat.</p>
<p>Where necessary, it will put forward proposals before the end of this year to improve the legislation's requirements with the view to facilitate proper enforcement. The Commission is working on short-term proposals to improve different technical aspects of the Community legislation and to facilitate cooperation and coordination between national authorities involved in international transport as well as in controls at national level.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to actively check the enforcement of the Directive. Infringement proceedings have already been opened against some Member States in relation to their failure to implement Community legislation in this area. The Commission will be following future developments very closely and will quickly take appropriate follow up measures, including the opening of further infringement proceedings if no improvements are seen.</p>
<p>In relation to the payment of export refunds for live cattle from the Community, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98 which stipulates that the payment of export refunds is subject to compliance with Directive 91/628/EEC and provides for an appropriate monitoring system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is currently carrying out an inquiry in several Member States with regard to the implementation of Regulation 615/98. The level of export aid is calculated with great care and limited to what is strictly necessary. It should be mentioned that, during the last year, subsidies paid for cattle traded for slaughtering were reduced significantly from 60.50 euros/100 kg to 41.00 euros/100 kg.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0016"></a>

<p>The issue to which the honourable Member refers has also been the subject of several complaints to the Commission, most of which being very recent.</p>
<p>On the basis of the first complaint the Commission requested information from the British authorities by letter dated 10 October 2000 mainly concerning the existence of an intervention plan for the area of Gibraltar (Article 50 of Directive 96/29/Euratom), the measures taken to inform the public in the event of a radiological emergency relating to the repair operations of the submarine and the possible impact on Gibraltar and Spanish territory of the said operations.</p>

<p>that such a tax, if introduced at Community level, is also unlikely to be possible under Article 57(2) of the EC Treaty, since that Article provides for restrictive measures only in a limited number of areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0025"></a>

<p>In the framework of a priority information campaign on the euro, part of the PRINCE programme and following a call for proposals aiming at the familiarisation with the euro as tomorrow’s common currency for 12 Member States, the Commission has selected those proposals which seemed to serve best that purpose.</p>
<p>Until now, the membership of a given organisation has never been a precondition for its participation to calls for proposals: no thresholds were ever set, and proposals have always been assessed on a case by case basis and in function of their intrinsic quality and interest, i.e. their capacity to reach the targeted audience and have the best impact within the limits of each individual proposal. Moreover, the efficiency of a given organisation has never depended on the importance of its membership.</p>
<p>To the extent the factor « membership » is traceable (*), the Commission is, of course, willing to provide the honourable Member with details of other bodies with a relatively small membership, but to trace them over the last five years will inevitably require time and personnel, so that in a first phase, the applications sent in 2000 would be screened, and only later could data covering the 1996 – 1999 period be provided.</p>
<p>(*)	The term « membership » may be confusing: in certain cases, it can mean « affiliated organisations » (which is the case for large European professional Federations, often based in Brussels), in other cases « individual members » (which is not unusual for relatively small organisations within the civil society, or NGOs).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community has adopted over the last decade a number of measures relating to the safety of passenger vessels and of their passengers. The issue of disabled passengers has been specifically raised in the context of two of these instruments in terms which are in line with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) recommendation referred to by the honourable Member</p>
<p>Council Directive 1999/35/EC<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high speed passenger craft services contains an obligation for the operating companies "to ensure that general information about the services and assistance available to elderly and disabled persons on board is made known to the passengers and is made available in formats suitable for people with impaired sight". Furthermore, it requires Member States authorities to control documented evidence of safety training for personnel providing safety assistance to passengers, and in particular to elderly and disabled persons in an emergency.</p>
<p>Directive 1998/41/EC<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, making mandatory the registration of persons on board passenger ships, provides for the voluntary registration of information concerning the need for special care or assistance in emergency situations. Such information has to be communicated to the master before the departure of the ship.</p>
<p>Commenting on the facts reported by the honourable Member, the Commission wishes to underline that such practices go against the specific provisions of Directives 1998/18/EC<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span> and 1999/35/EC. Directive 1998/18/EC (introducing safety rules and standards for passenger ships) requires that the master, or the designated officer, shall ensure that, without the expressed consent of the master or the designated officer, no passengers are allowed access to an enclosed ro-ro deck when the ship is underway. Directive 1999/35/EC stipulates that the vehicle deck should be vacated by passengers before the ship sails and that they do not again have access until immediately prior to docking. On basis of the above, the Commission is, of course, ready to take appropriate action if formal complains were notified.</p>
<p>It is clear that while the above Directives deal with the safety of disabled people on board vessels, they do not address accessibility. However, following its recent Communication "Towards a barrier free Europe for people with disabilities", the Commission has undertaken the task to further examine issues relating to accessibility of disabled people to the means of transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member is informed that on 22<span class="sup">nd</span> January 2001, the General Affairs Council agreed a revised version of the Union Common Position on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Among other issues, this Common Position sets out the importance that the Union attaches ‘to respect for international Law and human rights, including the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women’, denounces continuing discrimination against women in Afghanistan being ‘.. particularly concerned that this discrimination is hampering the humanitarian efforts of the international organisations and NGOs.’ The Common Position further notes in Article 1(c) that one of its objectives in Afghanistan is ‘to promote respect for international humanitarian law and human rights, including the rights of women and children’. Article 3(b) of the Common Position states that the Union ‘shall urge Afghan factions to end discriminatory policies and recognise, protect and promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women, including access to education and health facilities, employment, personal security and freedom from intimidation and harassment, and will emphasise the negative implications of discriminatory policies for the effective supply of aid’.</p>
<p>The honourable Member has asked for population figures, but she will appreciate that accurate figures with regard to populations inside Afghanistan are extremely difficult to come by. Estimates of the overall population used by international aid agencies and non governmental organisations (NGOs) working in Afghanistan vary from 20 to 25 million. If it is assumed that approximately half of this number is made up of women and girls and that approximately 90% live in Taliban controlled areas, then the number of women and girls in these areas would be between 9 and 11.25 million.</p>
<p>It should be noted that inside Afghanistan, NGOs implementing Community funded projects currently have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical related programmes, in spite of the fact that separation between the two genders has to be strictly observed.</p>
<p>Taliban decrees prohibiting women from working have had differing effects depending upon the areas of activity and the geographical areas: Medical and food projects continue to employ women. After negotiations between the authorities and the concerned partners, Community funded Food for Work programmes have been able to restart after interruption.</p>
<p>With regard to appeals to neighbouring states, the Commission acts together with the Member States in matters concerning declarations, appeals or requests to third countries. On the occasion of the Union-Pakistan ad hoc political dialogue in Islamabad on 22/23 November 2000, the Union side urged Pakistan to reopen its borders to refugees from Afghanistan. More recently, on 17 January 2001, the Union issued a statement urging the Tajik authorities ‘to do everything in their power to alleviate the humanitarian situation of the refugees, in close cooperation with competent international bodies like UNHCR’.</p>
<p>Additionally, article 1(g) of the Common Position states that it is an objective of the Union ‘to support the programmes of international organisations and NGOs for Afghan refugee populations in neighbouring countries’. The honourable Member is informed that at the end of 2000, the Commission committed EUR 9 million in aid to uprooted people in Iran and Pakistan and that it is currently preparing a commitment to finance relief operations for refugees in Pakistan which will focus on the provision of drinking water and sanitation.</p>
<p>It can also be confirmed that the European Union is willing to consider assisting the Tajik authorities, both bilaterally and through ECHO, in the light of assessments and any subsequent appeals for assistance from international agencies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0034"></a>

<p>The question put to the Commission concerns the application of the Community competition rules to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals.</p>
<p>First of all, it has to be noted that Community competition law is applicable if there is an appreciable effect on trade between Member States. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, an agreement between undertakings or an abuse of a dominant position affects trade between Member States when it is capable of influencing, either directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, the pattern of trade between Member States.</p>
<p>The situation described in the question does not give indications as to the applicability of Community competition law, but seems to fall rather into the scope of application of the national competition rules.</p>
<p>It might, nevertheless, be useful to indicate that the Court of Justice has ruled in the Binon judgement<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> in 1985</p>
<p>- that a system of selective distribution may be established for the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, without infringing the prohibition contained in Article 85(1) [now Article 81(1)], given the special nature of those products as regards their distribution (they can only be sold by retailers during an extremely limited period of time, the publishers undertake to take back unsold copies),</p>
<p>- but that the permissibility of such a system depends in particular on the criteria governing the choice of distributors. Those criteria must be objective and of a qualitative nature. They must be laid down uniformly for all re-sellers and must not be applied in a discriminatory fashion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The use of extensive farming methods for meat production in the Community and the encouragement thereof under the CAP vary considerably from one sector to another, depending on the structure and content of the respective COMs.</p>
<p>In the case of beef and veal, specific measures exist in the context of the premiums offered to producers with a view to encouraging them to shift to more extensive forms of farming.</p>
<p>The breeding premiums are limited on the basis of the fodder capacity of each holding in relation to the number and species of livestock qualifying for a premium. Granting of the premiums (special premium and suckler cow premium) is subject to compliance with a maximum density factor of two adult bovine units (ABUs) per hectare and per calendar year.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to consolidate incentives to the extensification of production with a view to improving their effectiveness vis-à-vis the environmental objectives, a supplementary amount is granted to producers benefiting from the special premium and/or the suckler cow premium who comply with certain genuine, rigorous, requirements concerning the density factor.</p>
<p>Agenda 2000 has greatly reinforced this measure by almost trebling the amount of aid and limiting the areas to be considered to open fields only, while also taking account of all the livestock present on a farm.</p>
<p>This extensification payment is, in principle, EUR 100 per special premium and suckler cow premium granted, provided the density factor of the holding is equal to or less than 1.4 ABU per hectare for the calendar year concerned. Member States may decide to phase this measure in, choosing from a number of differentiated arrangements.</p>
<p>In the case of sheepmeat, it is well known that this form of production relies almost exclusively on extensive farming methods. The measures applied under the COM in sheepmeat accordingly support this form of production.</p>
<p>The COM in pigmeat does not include any support instrument addressed directly to pigmeat producers. It is therefore difficult to influence their choice of farming methods under the CAP. However, in response to consumer and retailer demand, certain producers have, in the last few years, converted to extensive methods. It is very possible that more producers will be encouraged to follow this example by the current debate on food safety and animal welfare.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission draws the honourable Member's attention to the linkage established between direct support payments to producers and environmental requirements with the Agenda 2000 CAP reform. Member States are now required to take the measures which they consider appropriate in view of the situation of the agricultural land use or the production concerned and which reflect the potential environmental effects. Member States have a number of options insofar as the measures are concerned, including agri-environment commitments, respect for general environmental requirements and specific environmental requirements constituting a condition for direct payments. This measure, the details of the application of which are currently being discussed, has great potential, if well implemented by Member States, to contribute to environmental improvement and sustainable development in agriculture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0039"></a>

<p>The responsibility for regulating the Sellafield plant rests with the United Kingdom's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), which produced its own report on these tanks earlier in 2000. The RPII findings and recommendations broadly concur with those of the British regulator. According to a recent press release by BNFL (dated 4/12/00) on the subject of the RPII report, all of the recommendations made in the report have already been implemented or are part of their continuing dialogue with the NII.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to monitor closely BNFL's response to the points raised in these reports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0053"></a>

<p>What plans has the Commission to review the Third Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives with a view to enabling companies to offer insurance services to the entire single market?

<p>The insurance directives have completed the creation of the internal market in insurance. They institute a regime of approval and prudential supervision exercised once by the insurer's Member State of origin ('European passport'), which enables an insurer to operate in the Community on the basis of freedom of establishment or to provide services, subject to a single financial control regime.</p>
<p>The implementation of the directives has already had significant effects: insurers' international activities have increased, and competition on national markets has been boosted, in terms both of prices and of new products offered on the national markets. However, the impact of the internal market has been less pronounced, especially in the case of crossborder insurance transactions, for both the retail and wholesale markets (involving major industrial and commercial risks) which represent some 50% of the market.</p>
<p>The action plan for financial services endorsed by the Cologne European Council in 1999 lays down a programme of actions and priorities with a view to obtaining maximum advantage from the internal market in financial services, especially as regards the retail or consumer markets. Specific actions are proposed for insurance. In this regard, reference should be made to the proposal for a directive on insurance mediation submitted by the Commission in September 2000, the interpretative communication on the freedom to provide services of general interest in the insurance sector (February 2000), the proposal for a directive on distance selling in financial services, and the work in progress on e-commerce and financial services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0056"></a>

<p>In crossing Western Sahara without the prior authorisation of the Western Saharan government, the organisers of the Paris-Dakar rally risked in an irresponsible and criminal way contributing towards bringing about a resumption of the fighting in a conflict which has still to be settled after 25 years. The event gave backing to the Moroccan Government which claims sovereignty over Western Sahara in defiance of international law. The cease-fire which has held since 1991 is now fragile. The situation could flare up at any moment and degenerate into war, destroying all the efforts made to achieve peace and harming the country's future for a long time to come.</p>

<p>This year's Paris-Dakar Rally once again passed through territory occupied in breach of international law. In so doing, a driver was seriously injured by a landmine, aggravating the already tense situation in that region. The Polisario liberation movement put its soldiers on a state of alert after Moroccan army units had crossed the embankment along a five-kilometre section where the rally went through. What action does the Commission intend to take in order to counter the acute danger of war, maintain the cease-fire and contribute to a lasting peace settlement?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is following closely the progress being made in implementing the plan for settling the Western Sahara dispute, adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Like the Member States, the Commission fully supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, Mr James Baker, to find a fair, lasting, and sustainable solution for Western Sahara. The Union is in close contact with Mr Baker to whom it has been expressed readiness to assist in concrete terms the different stages of the implementation of the plan of the United Nations, from the identification of voters to the repatriation of refugees and the rehabilitation of the territory.</p>
<p>At the occasion of his recent visit to the Maghreb countries, the President of the Commission stressed the importance of strengthened dialogue within the Arab Maghreb Union. It is hoped that direct talks between the interest parties in an open dialogue will lead out of the current deadlock.</p>
<p>As to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, the existing agreement has expired and the Commission is in the process of negotiating a new agreement. In the expired agreement, as in the ongoing negotiations, the Commission has been referring to the fishing zone of Morocco being defined by the "water falling within sovereignty and/or within the jurisdiction of Morocco". This definition does not prejudge in any way the statute of the waters in the Saharan fishing bank. The latter is governed by international law, and in particular the various United Nations' resolutions, to which the Union constantly brought its support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission supports the establishment of the South East Europe University (SEEU) in FYROM as an important step in providing for the educational rights of the Albanian minority there.</p>
<p>The Commission is prepared to propose a total contribution of EUR 5 million for the SEEU. A sum of EUR 1 million has already been committed under the 2000 budget through a Commission Decision of 17 November. The procedures are now underway to facilitate payment of this amount to the University by May. The Commission will propose that a further EUR 4 million be committed under the 2001 budget. These funds should be transferred to the University before the second half of this year.</p>
<p>The Community commitment to the SEEU is seen as a necessary guarantee for smaller donors contemplating participation in the project and an important factor contributing towards a successful outcome. The Commission understands that the total amount which has been pledged so far does not fully cover the needs. However, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has not signalled that this would hinder the initiative from getting off the ground.</p>
<p>The Commission is supporting the initiative precisely for the reasons of its significance in terms of ethnic reconciliation between the populations in the country.</p>
<p>The Commission is not in a position to fully finance the SEEU. This would imply using up the bulk of funding available for FYROM for this project. In addition to having to address other needs, not least the implementation of obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, such an unbalanced allocation of funds would not be acceptable to the national authorities: it could even heighten ethnic tensions rather then soothe them.</p>
<p>It is important to refer from now on to the South East Europe (SEE) University rather than to the Tetovo University since the latter term refers to the existing unrecognised University. Given the sensitivity of the issue, we should not burden this new initiative with the heritage of that University.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0071"></a>

<p>Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) play a very important role in support of infrastructure projects in the South and in Eastern Europe. During the 1990’s, ECAs’ financing through loans, project guarantees and investment insurance averaged USD 80-100 billion per annum. Roughly 60% was channelled in support of energy-intensive projects: fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas developments, transportation, etc. While a few – most notably the US Export-Import Bank – weight environmental impact in deciding whether to make loans, most do not. This means that taxpayers money is being used to subsidise investments in carbon-based technologies. Given the seriousness of the climate problem – and EU commitments to the Kyoto Protocol – it is remarkable that so little attention has been paid to the critical role played by ECAs.</p>

This is to ensure that the internal market functions properly from the date of accession and that consumers are protected and correctly informed throughout the enlarged Community.</p>
<p>The Community acquis on food also includes a quality policy, i.e. provisions on specific products, for which there is a possibility of seeking protection for geographical names and traditional methods against misuse, misleading use and imitation.

<p>Can such measures be regarded as being in accordance with Community legislation and what measures will the Commission take in response to infringements thereof, given that they will make it impossible to establish nationality and hence to monitor the illegal entry and movement of third-country nationals within the territory of the Member States? What action will be taken by the European Union in response to the illegal granting of citizenship of Member States and, by extension, of Europe, and what action can be taken to put an end to this state of affairs? Has information been gathered with regard to naturalisation processes in Greece and other Member States and should the approximation of legislation regarding the acquisition of nationality in the EU Member States be considered?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are two parts to the honourable Member’s question, the first relating to the failure to specify nationality in the new Greek identity papers and the second to possible irregularities committed in attributing Greek nationality to certain persons.</p>
<p>As regards the first aspect, the Commission must inform you that it has, in a letter of 4 December 2000, already drawn the attention of the Greek Government to the fact that the deletion of references to nationality in Greek identity papers may be in contravention of Community law, particularly of the two directives to which the honourable Member refers, and may constitute an obstacle to the free movement of Greek citizens on Member State territory. Article 2(2) of Council Directives 68/360/EEC, of 15 October 1968, on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families, and 73/148/EEC, of 21 May 1973, on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to the establishment and provision of services, stipulate that “Member States shall, acting in accordance with their laws, issue to their nationals, or renew, an identity card or passport, which shall state in particular the holder's nationality.” This is also applicable to other classes of citizen within the European Union, particularly to citizens other than workers, insofar as Directives 90/364, 90/365 and 93/96 refer to the aforementioned directives.</p>
<p>The Greek Government replied in a letter of 18 January 2001. Their answer specified that Greek identity papers have Hellenic Republic in the header and are, moreover, issued exclusively to Greek nationals. The holder of Greek identity papers must necessarily, therefore, have Greek nationality without the need to specify this. The Greek Government acknowledged, nonetheless, that the matter of the deletion of references to nationality in the new Greek identity papers is currently being examined in the greatest detail in anticipation of a ruling pending in a case before the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission is thus unable to declare an opinion until the Greek Authorities have adopted a definitive position.</p>
<p>On the second aspect, it should be noted that, as the honourable Member points out, the granting of nationality of a Member State is a matter of national jurisdiction (see Declaration 2 on nationality of a Member State, annexed to the Final Act of the Conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States establishing the Treaty on European Union, OJ 1992, C 191, page 98). Nonetheless, exercise of this jurisdiction must comply with Community law (see: Judgement of the Court of Justice of 7 July 1992 in case C-369/90, Micheletti, European Court Reports 1992 page I-4239, item 10: “Under international law, it is for each Member State, having due regard to Community law, to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality.”)</p>
<p>In view of the above, the European Union is not authorised to proceed to harmonise national legislative texts on the granting of nationality. Furthermore, the European Commission may not act in place of the competent national administrative and judicial authorities and declare an opinion on any possible irregularities committed in the granting of Greek nationality to certain persons.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that persons holding valid Greek identity papers or passports will have no problem in travelling and residing freely within the territory of EU Member States. For reasons of legal security, it is commonly accepted that the holder of a valid travel document may exercise all the rights arising from possession of such a document until it is cancelled, withdrawn or until it expires.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In addition, the Commission has recently informed the Greek authorities of the importance it is attaching to proper functioning of access to the airport and other aspects in conjunction with the opening of Spata airport.

Fulfilling the commitment it made in the White Paper to study in more depth the economic issues involved in liability, the Commission launched seven new studies: four on financial insurance issues, one focused on industry competitiveness issues, one on the impact of the proposals on prevention of damage and one on the valuation and restoration of biodiversity damage.

<p>There is no doubt that recreational angling is a widespread spare time activity all over Europe: in certain areas it is also an important factor of the local economy, mainly of the tourist industry. In some cases both recreational anglers and professional fishermen exploit the same resource, which leads to a certain competition between the two.</p>
<p>The European Angler’s Alliance (EAA) has contacted the Commission and a meeting was held in November 2000. It was agreed that the EAA would be informed about the Work Programme of the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture, in order to allow closer involvement of recreational anglers in discussion within that Committee of matters of special interest to them, or on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>The Commission has received complaints on this issue and is currently examining the Danish measure in the light of the principle set forth in Articles 28 to 30 (ex Articles 30-36) of the EC Treaty, prohibiting unjustified trade barriers, and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. The Court has stated that a national price regulation could be contrary to the principle of free movement of goods when certain conditions are fulfilled. At this stage the Commission is awaiting supplementary information to be supplied by the complainants illustrating the effects of the Danish measure before taking any further steps. When the Commission has examined this information in the light of Articles 28 to 30 of the EC Treaty it will decide on whether the Danish measure constitutes an infringement of Community law.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of remedies, the Court of Justice has pronounced itself in its jurisprudence (joined cases C-46/93 and C-48/93 “Brasserie du Pêcheur”). It has stated that in the event of a breach of Community law, the principle whereby a State is liable for loss and damage caused to individuals is inherent in the system of the Treaty. Therefore, when a breach of Community law by a Member State is attributable to the national legislature acting in a field in which it has a wide discretion to make legislative choices, individuals suffering loss or injury thereby are entitled to reparation where the rule of Community law breached is intended to confer rights upon them, the breach is sufficiently serious and there is a direct causal link between the breach and the damage sustained by the individuals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0097"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the extent of the disaster which has struck Portugal and the extent of the damage inflicted. It offers its condolences to the families of the victims and its deepest sympathy to all those persons affected by these terrible floods.</p>
<p>The Commission has several times had occasion to outline the resources available to it in order to contribute towards offsetting the effects of natural disasters by means of existing financial instruments. There is indeed some margin for action within the Structural Fund programmes. As the Commissioner responsible for regional policy announced in the plenary sitting in Brussels on 31 January 2001, the Commission proposes, in close liaison with the Portuguese Government and the local authorities, to look into the possibilities for reallocating resources from the Structural Fund programmes which have already been approved for the period 2000-2006 in order to assist the affected areas.</p>
<p>The Commission would point out that the budget line for the allocation of emergency aid to victims of disasters within the Community ceased to exist in 1998. The question of reintroducing a specific budget line was raised in the course of the budgetary procedure for 2001 but was not retained in the budget adopted. At the present time, therefore, there is no budget framework for Community emergency aid to the flood victims in Portugal.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Nice redefines Article 100 TEC and specifies that the decision is taken by qualified majority. The article does not specify conditions for the granting of Community financial assistance. Nonetheless, a Declaration which will be appended to the Treaty of Nice stipulates that such assistance must comply with the financial perspectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0100"></a>

<p>During the 1990s, the economic situation for people in the world's least developed countries scarcely improved. High customs duties and other barriers to trade were amongst the reasons for this. The UN has calculated that developing countries as a whole would stand to earn 100-150 bn dollars a year if all existing trade barriers were removed. The Commission proposal to remove EU customs duties on everything but arms for the world's 48 poorest countries is therefore a small step in the right direction. According to reports in the Swedish press, however, it appears that the Commission is considering keeping customs duties on agricultural products. That is alarming, as poor countries' exports are concentrated in the sphere of labour-intensive products, especially agricultural produce. It should be borne in mind that, at present, the highest EU duties are precisely on agricultural products and also that nearly half the EU budget is spent on subsidising farming in the European Union.</p>

<p>The Television without frontiers (TVWF) Directive (Council Directive 89/552/EEC, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council) provides the legal framework for television broadcasting within the Community.</p>
<p>The TVWF Directive, as adopted in 1989, contained certain provisions relating to television advertising. In particular, Article 16 lays down certain principles relating to advertising and children. It states that television advertising shall not cause moral or physical detriment to minors and sets out certain criteria to achieve that aim. These criteria are that advertising:</p>
<p>Shall not directly exhort minors to buy a product or service by exploiting their inexperience or credulity;</p>
<p>Shall not directly encourage minors to persuade their parents or others to purchase the goods or services being advertised;</p>
<p>Shall not unreasonably show minors in dangerous situations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these provisions apply to all advertising, and not simply to advertising intended for minors. The Commission has no reason at this stage to consider that the approach of the Directive on this issue needs to be modified.</p>
<p>When the directive was reviewed, the Commission undertook to carry out a study on the impact of television advertising and teleshopping on minors, in the context of the next review of the Television Directive, in accordance with Article 26 thereof. This study should be completed shortly.

<p>However, the Commission can neither interfere with the ruling of the High Court, nor provide a definitive interpretation of the Community legislation. The definition of packaging, as stated in Directive 94/62/EC<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on packaging and packaging waste, may only be determined ultimately by the Court of Justice.</p>

<p>It seems that a consensus has emerged from these discussions that it could be useful to complement the current definition by annexing technical guidance to the Directive.

<p>The possibility that a new European chemicals policy might require a large programme of testing on animals is a cause of grave concern to very many people in Europe.</p>
<p>The current system requires that a standard set of tests is completed before any safety assessment is carried out, and lacks a clear strategy for minimising animal testing. Would the Commission agree that a new system is required that is based on a step-wise approach, so that tests for properties with the most significant risk management implications are conducted first, avoiding inconsequential animal testing? Furthermore, would it not agree that before any additional animal tests are considered, full use should be made of all existing information, including evidence of safety-in-use (which may cover many years of use by the public), structure-activity analysis and other non-animal test methods and that wherever appropriate, the precautionary principle should be rigorously applied?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is indeed considering the issue of the safety of chemical substances. It is particularly concerned that the majority of the chemical substances now on the Community market were first marketed before 1981, when the requirement for fuller information on toxicological and ecotoxicological properties was introduced for new chemicals. Therefore, the market is dominated by substances for which there is no or insufficient data to demonstrate their safety. This situation should be improved, as serious damage to human health has already occurred in the case of asbestos where workers were exposed.</p>
<p>Against this background, it is necessary to consider how to improve the protection of human health and the environment. In so doing, the Commission will balance the need for more information against its commitment to limit animal testing. Where appropriate, the necessary test programme would have to be minimised by promoting use of the approaches proposed by the honourable Member. Furthermore, test requirements may be reduced for substances neither used by the general population nor released into the environment. The precautionary principle will, of course, be applied as appropriate.</p>
<p>The use of animals in the resulting test programme should be minimised through use of existing alternative testing methods and continuing development of new alternative methods. The Commission is committed to the objective of refinement, reduction and replacement of animal testings as is shown in its research programmes, in particular the Quality of Life Programme, and in the activities carried out by the Joint Research Centre, specifically at the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods which validates alternative methods. This is supported by Community legislation requiring that, where equivalent methods exist, using the minimum number of animals shall be chosen. The forthcoming White Paper on chemical strategy will also reflect this priority.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will see that the Commission is seeking to balance animal welfare considerations against the potentially serious threats to human health and the environment, including wild animals, presented by insufficiently tested chemicals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0107"></a>

<p>The Commission has two sources of information on what Member States are doing to improve the opportunities for older workers in work places and labour markets: (1) occasional studies and (2) the ongoing monitoring of National Action Plans as part of the employment process. </p>
<p>(1) A recent comprehensive overview of measures taken by individual Member States was produced by the Employment Observatory and published as Trends No. 33 "Older Workers on the Labour Market" in 1999.</p>
<p>(2) In the European employment strategy, attention to older workers' issues has increased considerably over the last 2 years. From a simple mention in the 1999 employment guidelines, older workers issues have been upgraded to a special guideline (no. 3) on active ageing in 2001. At the same time a number of other guidelines are of relevance for the improvement of conditions for older workers (e.g. 4-6 life long learning; 8 anti-discrimination; 14 flexible working time etc.).</p>
<p>In its employment recommendations the Commission and the Council have paid considerable attention to older workers issues both in 2000 and in 2001. It was suggested to 8 Member States in 2000 and to 9 of them in 2001 that they ought to intensify their efforts to enhance the capacity and incentives for older workers to remain in the labour market.</p>
<p>The "Joint Employment Report" assesses each year progress achieved by Member States in implementing the Guidelines. The 2000 Joint Report recognised that: "Most Member States have started to implement or are planning to introduce soon measures encouraging older people to stay longer in employment, by raising the retirement age or by introducing or strengthening disincentives to early retirement. The most comprehensive reforms are being undertaken or envisaged in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland."<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span></p>

<p>Over the last decade a favourable economic outlook for the Union has been created as a result of a sound macroeconomic framework combined with a real commitment to reform of labour, capital, goods and service markets. However, in a world that does not stand still, progress towards meeting the objectives made at the Lisbon European Council needs to be based on strong commitment to concerted action across different policy domains.</p>
<p>The Lisbon objective requires action both by the Community and the Member States. The combination of policies which is required is a broad one: sound macroeconomic policy; structural reforms which promote adaptable labour markets, increased innovation and higher competitiveness; active policies promoting the development of human resources, lifelong learning, inclusion and solidarity. The Luxembourg process through which the Employment Guidelines are coordinated contributes to ensuring that a strategic and coordinated approach is pursued, and several of the individual Guidelines are specifically aimed at young people and the long-term unemployed.</p>
<p>Along the road to meeting the Lisbon objective, certain themes are of particular importance. First, taking account of job quality while increasing employment rates. Second, providing life-long learning which enhances the capacity of people to participation in the knowledge-based society. Third, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders play their part: from governments, to Social Partners, and Regional and Local actors. Fourth, taking care that different policy actions are consistent and complementary. Last, establishing methods for measuring actions and progress. In each of these areas, care is being taken to ensure that the interests of young people and the long-term unemployed are being taken into account. In particular, it should be noted that the newly established Social Inclusion process promises to further enhance this positive situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0111"></a>

<p>The Lisbon European Council recognised that the number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion in the Community is unacceptable and that efforts are needed to make a significant impact on the eradication of poverty and exclusion in the next 10 years. Homelessness, including other forms of precarious housing, is an important dimension of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the fight against social exclusion in the Community, the Lisbon European Council also agreed for the Member States to work together through an open method of coordination, combining national action plans on how Member States are fighting social exclusion and a Community Programme (to facilitate policy-oriented cooperation in this field between Member States). The aim of the national action plans and the Programme is to make it possible to achieve the common objectives against poverty and social exclusion which were adopted last December by the Nice European Council. Among these objectives, several are particularly relevant for tackling homelessness.</p>
<p>The National action plans will be submitted by June 2001 for the period 2001-2003. They should include concrete initiatives aimed at tackling and preventing homelessness. The Council and the Commission will subsequently adopt a joint report by the end of 2001 presenting the conclusion of the examination of the plans.</p>
<p>The Community programme, which should support transnational cooperation activities, is currently discussed in Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure. The Swedish Presidency of the Council has expressed hopes for the Programme to be adopted in the summer of this year. The start of the programme does, of course, depend on the date of adoption by the Council and the Parliament but is most likely to be 1 January 2002. Policy cooperation initiatives on homelessness issues that arise as a (common) priority in the National action plans would be eligible for funding under the programme.</p>
<p>The proposed Programme includes a provision to support networking at European level of organisations involved with the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The Commission is currently supporting the FEANTSA network which focuses on fighting homelessness and will endeavour to do so until the start of the programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0114"></a>

<p>The transport of radioactive waste by sea or land is an operation which is fully controlled at a technical level. It is a routine operation which has been carried out for several decades now, whether within one country or between countries, without any unfortunate incidents such as leaks or other damage. The radioactive waste shipped has to meet a number of strict criteria, in particular concerning container characteristics, as defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency and incorporated into national law. There are also various international agreements concerning accidents, safety and transport in the sphere of the transportation of nuclear material.</p>
<p>In the case of maritime shipment, the containers used to transport spent nuclear fuel have been designed to be totally resistant in the event of immersion, even at great depths. In the present case, the only potential problem concerns adaptation of the specifications of the transporting vessels – which have to operate in Arctic waters – to International Maritime Organisation standards. Only that organisation has the authority to issue binding guidelines on the matter.</p>
<p>The fact that the transport of radioactive waste between Europe and Japan is carried out by sea, across the Arctic Ocean and close to the coastline of the Russian Federation, is not in itself grounds for taking preventive action, unless it is found that this transport is infringing IMO rules.</p>
<p>There is no legal instrument which would enable the Commission to restrict the use of Arctic waters for transportation of radioactive waste produced by the reprocessing of nuclear fuel in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0116"></a>

<p>The honourable Member is correct in stating that Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development shall apply as of 1 January 2000.</p>
<p>This date marks the point where projects become eligible to receive aid under the ‘rural development’ operational programme submitted by Greece in April 2000 and which also includes measures in favour of young farmers.</p>
<p>However, Member States are very often reluctant to implement programmes until they are sure of the Commission’s approval and indeed, this programme has not yet been approved by the Commission.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this delay, which the Commission is well aware of, is the operational status of the new management authorities required following the reform of the Structural Funds. In liaison with the Greek Authorities, the Commission has drawn up a methodology and a timetable for the implementation of these management authorities, which should have been allocated sufficient personnel and which should be fully operational within the first two months of 2001. This would make it possible for the programme to be officially adopted in March and subsequently for measures to be implemented from that time on. The Greek Government has just informed the Commission that the management authority responsible for the Rural Development programme shall be operational by the end of February 2001. This programme should therefore be approved shortly by the Commission.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that Commission Regulation No 2075/2000, amending Regulation No 1750/1999, stipulates that, as regards applications for aid made by young farmers for the first time in 2000, one of the criteria – the requirement of being under 40 years of age – must be fulfilled at the time of presenting the application and not at the time that a decision is made to grant aid in that specific case. This interim provision will make it possible to partly offset the effects of the above delay affecting young farmers who submitted an application for aid before first setting up business during that year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission appreciates the support the honourable Members and many other Members have expressed for the Commission’s new policy on Malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB in the context of poverty reduction. The deaths of 5 million people per year, most of them in developing countries, from these three communicable diseases represent a global emergency against which the Commission with the Member States and its international partners should take coherent and concerted action. Although priority must be given to the preventive efforts, increased support for the development and availability of new vaccines for AIDS and malaria will be an integral part of the efforts.</p>
<p>The Commission has prepared a “Programme for Action” to implement the new Community policy on the three major communicable diseases over the coming 5 years (2001-2006) which will be sent to Parliament and Council. It is hoped that Parliament will support the Programme for Action which identifies a substantial number of actions in support of the development and availability of AIDS and malaria vaccines including support to networks for the testing of vaccines, such as the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network.</p>
<p>The Programme for Action (2001-2006) will be financed through the Community’s existing financial instruments such as the European Development Fund (EDF) and geographical budget lines. Where appropriate, this may include the use of dedicated thematic budget lines such as budget line B7-6213 (previous B7-6211 and B7-6212).

Consumers are the main losers as a result of such discrimination against e-tailers, since e-tailing enables consumers who live in areas far from big cities and specialist shops to buy goods to which they previously did not have access. They may no longer be able to get hold of the goods they want at all if e-tailing is not given the conditions it needs to survive.</p>

<p>However, the airport industry has been going through a process of deep transformation for the last years. In the increasingly liberal and competitive environment of air transport, airport operations have also been changing in nature and have been evolving from government branches towards commercial undertakings. A major feature in this evolution is the emerging of a certain degree of competition between airports. This evolution is reflected in a recent judgement of the Court of First Instance<a href="#defann_77_2" name="refann_77_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, which clearly states that airports are undertakings submitted to competition law.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, competition law, namely Articles 87 and 86 of the EC Treaty may apply to airports too. Of course, the application of the relevant provisions of the Treaty to the public financing of airport infrastructure must duly take into account the Community interest as well as the general economic interest airports may be entrusted with.</p>
<p>For these reasons it is difficult to give a general answer to an individual case. A case by case assessment is necessary, in order to evaluate if, in the cases at stake, the provision of financial aid has an impact on competition between airlines and between airports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Is the Commission aware that the French traffic police are stopping and imposing fines of Ptas 25 000 on Spanish motorists driving in France who have not exchanged their Spanish licence plates for the new European model which was adopted several months ago in Spain? The reason given for the fine is a failure to display the new European licence plate, and has nothing to do with whether or not the vehicle displays the letter denoting its country of origin, which is compulsory under the Vienna Convention.</p>
<p>Given that in Spain all new cars automatically have the new model licence plates, and that older cars may retain the old model or, on payment of a flat­rate fee, may exchange them on a voluntary basis, and since there are no European rules obliging Member States to replace old licence plates with the new model, what are the Commission's views on the attitude of the French authorities described above?

<p>The requirement to display the distinguishing sign of the country where a vehicle is registered originates in Article 37 of the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.</p>
<p>Council Regulation (EC) No 2411/98 provides for the mutual recognition by Member States of the distinguishing sign of the Member State in which motor vehicles are registered provided that these signs conform to the provisions laid down in the annex.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member states, Community law does not impose the use of the so-called Community model licence plate described in that regulation.</p>
<p>There are therefore no grounds for police action against drivers of vehicles purely because they are not using the European model licence plate.</p>
<p>If proof (e.g. copies of police reports) were to be brought to the attention of the Commission confirming that the French authorities are imposing fines in such circumstances, then the Commission would undoubtedly refer the matter immediately to the French authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0131"></a>

<p>A recent study by the Institute of Public Health Studies in Valencia has confirmed what has been known for years, namely the harmful and indeed fatal consequences of atmospheric pollution for the health of inhabitants of the Planet. 6% of annual deaths are due to atmospheric pollution and, more particularly, to atmospheric pollution caused by the large quantities of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and ozone emitted. It is well established that, apart from industry, exhaust fumes from car motors constitute the main source of pollution. Given that similar studies carried out in Europe have found that atmospheric pollution is responsible not only for cardiovascular diseases but also for respiratory problems, what specific measures does the Commission intend to promote in order effectively to protect citizens' health?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last few years the Community has agreed a substantial package of measures to protect citizens against air pollution. Directive 1999/30/EC sets ambient air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and lead. A similar Directive, adopted last year, sets standards for carbon monoxide and benzene. All are based on World Health Organisation air quality guidelines. The standards must be met by 2005 or in some cases 2010. But Member States will have to provide the public with information on levels of pollution from the start and must make public plans for improving the worst areas. Proposals setting objectives for ozone, and national emission ceilings to help meet those objectives, are currently before Parliament for Second Reading.</p>
<p>Directive 98/69/EC on light vehicles and Directive 1999/96/EC on Heavy Duty Vehicles are introducing progressively tighter emission limits which will help to meet air quality goals. Directive 97/68/EC is tackling off-road vehicles. Fuel standards are also subject to progressively tighter legislation and the Commission has recently completed a consultation exercise on lowering the sulphur content in fuels to below 10 parts per million.</p>
<p>Member States are implementing the IPPC Directive, amongst others, to reduce emissions from industry. And the proposed revision to the Directive on Large Combustion Plants, also at Second Reading, will further reduce emissions of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>But there is still more to be done. The proposal for a Sixth Environmental Action Programme explains that the Commission intends to set up an integrated thematic programme to develop future policy on air quality. The Clean Air For Europe Programme will aim to ensure that existing legislation is fully implemented, and will review the latest research on health effects and other matters to determine whether standards need to be revised and if so, how they could be met cost effectively. The Commission will present a Communication to Parliament and Council this session, setting out in more detail the aims and scope of the CAFE programme. It is aimed to produce a first integrated strategy by the end of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
