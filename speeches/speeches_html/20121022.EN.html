I want to draw your attention to the tragic case of Malala Yousafzai. This 14-year-old Pakistani girl was shot in the head by a Taliban while she was sitting in the school bus. Her crime: supporting education for girls. Allow me, speaking on behalf of the entire House, to express my deep consternation and condemn that act of cowardice in the strongest terms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Pakistani authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure that all children, and especially young girls, have safe access to school education. This young girl, Malala, stands as a symbol for more than 250 million young girls worldwide who live in poverty and have neither access to nor any prospect of elementary basic rights, such as education.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than a fortnight ago, on 11 October, we celebrated the first International Day of the Girl, aimed at raising awareness of how often girls’ human rights are violated worldwide. We have a moral responsibility to protect these girls and offer them a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who is also the father of a daughter, I feel personally affected by the Malala case. How can anyone want to shoot a 14-year-old girl who has done nothing more than wanting to go to school herself and championing the right of other girls in her country to be able to do the same, i.e. to claim a self-evident right, that of being allowed to go to school?</p>
<p class="contents">I wish this courageous child, this 14-year-old champion of girls’ rights, a full recovery and hope that her work will inspire a new generation of young women throughout the world with the same courage to fight for their rights.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. −</span></span>   Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Conference of Presidents has decided to cancel the plenary sitting in Brussels in November. Let me briefly take this opportunity to inform you of the facts and the situation. As you all know, the ceiling of the Brussels Chamber has become unstable. During the inspections that take place on a regular basis, we found cracks in three out of 21 ceiling beams. On 31 August, I was informed that this could be dangerous. I therefore had the Chamber closed immediately. Let me add that, according to the first report submitted to us, the place most at risk in the Chamber was the President’s seat. So you can understand why I immediately took steps. Further investigations have shown that there is, indeed, serious structural damage, which in fact is not attributable to use of poor material or to sloppy building work but is clearly a question of material wear and tear, of a nature that was not foreseeable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked the Secretary-General to pull out all the stops and bring in every available expert. The Belgian Government – as I have informed the President, Mr Di Rupo – has brought in specialists from the Belgian Régie des Bâtiments to assist Parliament in making all the necessary decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are assuming that the repair work will take quite some time. Let me add one thing: we had to support the ceiling from within. However, the supports themselves are so heavy that the scaffolding that was erected to prop up the ceiling has also proved too heavy for the floor – so much so, in fact, that we also have to prop up the rooms below it and cannot use them. That is why we have cleared a number of areas below the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next two weeks, solutions will be suggested and two internationally renowned, state-recognised inspectorates will be drawing up a safety report on the proposed solutions. I do not know when we will be able to re-open the Chamber in Brussels. I can tell you, however, that experience shows that this kind of building work can take quite some time.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these difficult circumstances, we are carrying on with our activities. I have also invited the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was after all billed to speak at the short part-session in November, to come to Parliament in spite of this, to attend an open Conference of Presidents. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has – what a surprise – happily agreed to make its meeting room available to Ms Merkel because it is the largest one apart from the Chamber. That is where we will be holding an open Conference of Presidents, at which basically the procedure will be the same as it would be for the Chancellor’s speech in plenary. I have agreed this with Ms Merkel.</p>
<p class="contents">Another brief reminder, ladies and gentlemen. I have written to you – I cannot remember how often over the past few months – and I hope you have all read the letters, about a photo session we will be holding here tomorrow morning at 12.30. A few minutes before the voting begins, there will be a 360-degree photo giving a panoramic 3D view of the Chamber with Members in their seats. You will remember that I have written to you about this several times and on several occasions. I was told, however, that some Members say they never received a letter from me. I do not believe this and think it more likely that they never read the letter. So, for all those who have not opened their mail, whether in real life or on their computer, tomorrow at 12.25 we will be setting up a 3D-360-degree camera here, which will photograph you all, and after that we will be putting the portraits of you in your seats on the internet so that every voter and every interested party will be able immediately to recognise the individual Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

<p class="contents">Before going into the merits, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all the committee members, as well as the officials and other contributors, for the work they have undertaken over the past months. As you know, the Council proposed a significant number of cuts, in stark contrast to the statements from the European Council of 28 and 29 June, at which the decision had been taken at the highest political level to invest in order to support growth and development across Europe. So, in our reading, we decided to reinstate the draft budget from the Commission and to make selective increases to resources in certain chapters of the budget which were closely related to the policies of growth and job creation, in particular for our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have had occasion to point out before, this is not a feckless gesture, given today’s climate: we all know the fiscal difficulties confronting each Member State. But the answer to the crisis – as the European Council also pointed out – must be more Europe and not less Europe. I would characterise the position that we are to vote on tomorrow as responsible. But responsible does not mean defeatist: it means contributing to economic renewal by certain precise and selective increases, which are more limited than those in a normal reading at the European Parliament, especially in terms of commitments made, but taking account of the general climate of austerity and the sacrifices being imposed at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I don’t believe that the Member States can accuse us of calling for increases which are not in line with today’s crisis, and I repeat that we are determined to maintain sufficient investment to bring about a new boost to the economy, responding to the pleas from our people who are suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the question of payments. It will not have escaped anyone that this is the most delicate aspect of the negotiations, but I think we have to approach the topic from a technical rather than a political viewpoint. The level of payments set by the Commission in the draft budget has been established for each item on the basis of the Member States’ own estimates, revised downwards. So the motion for an increase of 6.8 % on 2012 is merely a realistic indication of the resources required to pay the claims from the Member States and to honour all the commitments we have made since 2007. We cannot now consider jeopardising the implementation of particular European programmes – as has happened in the past few days – and I find it inconceivable that the reading of the Council and the statements made by some ministers could be based on figures which are clearly insufficient to finance these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all agreed in our press statements that the answer to the crisis is Europe. It is a shame that, when we get down to specifics, these words are not followed by practical actions. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the problem we are faced with is one of the credibility and trustworthiness of the European Union. In fact, paying the Member States’ claims is a legal obligation, which we cannot simply ignore; and it is certainly not for Parliament to explain this to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would remind you of the wording of the resolution accompanying tomorrow’s vote, in which Parliament gives its Conciliation Committee a mandate not to accept the level of payments, either for the draft amending budget No 6 or for the 2013 budget, if the latter does not sufficiently cover the needs for payment during 2012 and 2013 as estimated by the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regarding the latter, it is always difficult to set your own budget, and this year it is even more difficult, as we face tough economic and financial times. Therefore, the European Parliament took very seriously the Commissioner’s letter earlier this year when he suggested to all the institutions that they limit the increase for 2013 to 1.9 %. Since the start of this year, the aim of this Parliament has been to keep our increase below 1.9 %, including the extra costs incurred because of Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">We started with a figure of 2.4 % earlier this year, but straightaway we started to look for savings. We agreed to freeze all Members’ allowances – the daily and office allowances – and we agreed to cut our travel budget once again. We also set up a working group between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau to look at further savings. This working group, I am glad to say, has been able to identify more savings. We have been able to find a 5 % cut in the travel budget. We have decided to save EUR 5.3 million from the budget line for the House of European History, and we have found other ways of finding EUR 3.1 million to fund the expansion of wifi within the European Parliament buildings themselves. I am pleased to say that, at a recent conciliation meeting between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets, we agreed a 1.9 % increase for Parliament’s budget – including the extra cost of Croatia – but also including the 1.7 % proposed salary increases. So when colleagues do the mathematics and look at the actual increase proposed for Parliament’s budget next year, they will see it is well below 1 % – indeed I believe what we are proposing is nearer 0.6 %.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I want to thank the members of the Budget Committee and the Bureau for their cooperation, but also all my shadows for their cooperation. We have worked extremely hard to get an increase at this level. I think that shows in the fact that there are no budget line amendments to be voted on tomorrow and that we are able, I believe, to stick to the agreement we reached with the Bureau some time ago. Therefore, this Parliament is able to say that we have set in place a responsible budget for 2013 and that we will continue to look for further savings.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have also been encouraging other institutions to set a responsible budget. I believe it was a mistake by the Council some time ago to propose a blanket freeze for all the budgets of all the institutions. All the institutions are different, with different needs and different pressures, and therefore we should be looking at their budgets individually. Certainly that is what I have done as rapporteur – I have sat down with each institution to look at their budgets in great detail. I am therefore proposing that we partially reinstate the budget of most of the other institutions to around the 1.9 % figure I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a few institutions which are likely to come in a little higher than that because of their own special circumstances. I believe the Ombudsman, the Court of Justice and the European External Action Service also have special circumstances and may warrant an increase of slightly above the 1.9 % figure. I hope that tomorrow, my colleagues will accept these proposals for Parliament’s budget and also for the budget of all the other institutions. It has been a tough budget, but I do believe we have achieved our aim – a 1.9 % increase – while at the same time making savings but also protecting the effectiveness of this Parliament and of individual Members of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 11 September I also had the honour of presenting to you in detail the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2013, as adopted by the Council on 24 July.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, at the budgetary trialogue, I had the opportunity of giving some initial reactions to the amendments which the European Parliament intends to vote on. I wish to recall that the Council reached an agreement on its position on the draft budget for 2013, following difficult negotiations, and accepted a limited increase in commitments and payment appropriations compared to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the considerable effort and budgetary constraints that Member States are currently facing at national level, and we have to take these into account. I believe that, as the Member States endeavour to consolidate their budgets, it is crucial to deliver the right message to European citizens. Today I will take note of the positions taken by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now focus on some issues to which the Council attaches particular importance. Firstly, the Council considers that the existing ceilings of the multiannual financial framework must be respected. It is also important to ensure adequate margins under the different ceilings in order to be able to cope with unforeseen situations. The Council is therefore concerned about the European Parliament’s amendments, which considerably reduce the margins in all headings, the only exception being heading 5. Moreover, the European Parliament proposes to go beyond the ceilings of subheading 1a, requiring the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council regrets the increasing payment appropriations that the European Parliament intends to vote on, especially when their level exceeds the Commission’s draft budget. The Council is aware of the European Parliament’s intentions to support and highlight several of its political priorities. However, the overall level of payment appropriations retained should be sufficient but not overestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council wishes to find an agreement with the European Parliament on a reasonable level of payment appropriations for the current budgetary year, including draft amending budget No 5, the global transfer and the upcoming draft amending budget No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind you that the Council is opposed to the broad use of reserves that you intend to vote on, especially when their release is accompanied by conditions which are not in line with the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Appropriations should only be entered in the reserve in the absence of a basic act and in cases of serious doubt about the adequacy of the appropriations or their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me reiterate the Council’s hope and conviction that the existing excellent climate of cooperation will prevail during the rest of the budgetary procedure, leading to a mutually-satisfying agreement on the 2013 budget. We fully respect the European Parliament and your intentions, even when we are not in a position to entirely share the stance you adopt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should draw on the experience of the tensions we have in this year’s budget; they should be kept very strongly in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I welcome – not surprisingly – the reading of the proposal by the Committee on Budgets about the restoration of our draft proposal for next year. We share the same priorities. It is very clear to me that budgetary efforts nowadays should be undertaken in close conjunction with the growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda of the European Union. This should not be just an illusion of a growth strategy; it should be very well equipped with money.</p>
<p class="contents">We notice that Parliament is very restrained as to the level of commitments. That is why it is leaving some unallocated margins for unforeseen events, and it is easy to foresee that this will also be needed for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Friday we adopted the amending budget for agriculture for next year that more or less confirms our early estimates, but as Mr La Via clearly stated, the main sensitive issue is the level of payments. We cannot endorse the Council’s decision to cut our proposal by more than EUR 5 billion, because this is simply contradicting earlier announcements on the growth and jobs agenda for Europe: they were made in June, and in July come cuts of that amount. This ignores the reality of what is really needed this year, and next, and we cannot simply continue with the systematic underfunding of the European budget, as it is hindering the implementation of so many programmes. This year we should also base our programming of the implementation of the budget – which is now more than EUR 10 billion bigger than last year (an indication of the maturity of many programmes) – on the need to cover this year all that should be paid this year in order to enter next year with a clear vision of what is really needed in 2013 and not carry forwards all the accumulated problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas we are really running short of money. For example, for the Social Fund we have to stop payments in the area of competitiveness, as there are no more resources available. There is a very high level of implementation generally in cohesion funding. As for the research grants, they already needed to be reinforced back in July. So the tension this year indicates the need for an amending and correcting budget for this year in order to cover what is really needed in the remaining period of this year before we can discuss and agree on the 2013 level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the position on administration that Mr Vaughan takes is the right one. We should be constrained, but of course there are limits to savings, given the new responsibilities of the European Union. So this should be below the level of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our letter of executability is coming soon in order to complete the full picture. That is also about pilot projects and preparatory actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are not happy with the reserves, but I understand that we could end the conciliation after the written explanations without reserves. Our role is to submit everything that is needed as the basis for sound programming for 2013 so that Parliament has a full picture of what is really reasonable in the 2013 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The budget of the common foreign and security policy should be more transparent and more detailed than hitherto. Crisis management operations and special representatives’ budgets should appear separately in their own budget lines. This would give the budgetary authority, Parliament, and citizens a better indication and more information about where money is used. It would also make it easier to request money for a specific item. Money is not the problem facing the European common foreign and security policy, rather the problem is that the EU does not have a common will, a common line. The priorities of the EU’s foreign policy have not been set, and, as a general rule, there are two lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again highlight the external action service budget in which a 6 % increase is proposed. That’s a large increase. I do appreciate that this is a new way of working, but here, too, consideration must be given to where savings can be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament.

In line with the rapporteur, I am obviously fully in agreement, and can declare my agreement, that there is a need for more Europe and not less Europe. It is, therefore, obviously gratifying that the Committee on Budgets supports lifelong learning, the programme for 2013 that is at the heart of efforts towards achieving growth in the 2020 strategy. We obviously have to continue to ensure that students, teachers and academics have the necessary mobility. These programmes are crucial in ensuring the growth we all need. It is, therefore, obviously a matter of great concern that the Council has decided to cut the payments. This is close to being absurd, and is completely the wrong signal to give in the situation we are now in.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sport, we have a number of actions under way, and there continues to be broad support for us being able to test these areas before we obtain an actual sports programme in 2014, and that is obviously also really, really good.

<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the issues relating to the 3.89 % increase in this year’s budget for the European Ombudsman and to point out that this increase is due to technical reasons, such as the increase in rent in Strasbourg and the necessity of moving to new offices in Brussels because the European Parliament decided to convert the current offices into a museum. As a result, the cost is not flexible and it should not be thought that there is a real increase in the cost of the European Ombudsman’s procedures in relation to this move, which has a cost, at a time of crisis, for Parliament. Finally, I should like to note that the increase in credits for contract workers of approximately EUR 110 000 is, according to the information we have, completely natural and is subject to the general Staff Regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr La Via, as the rapporteur for this budget, for all his magnificent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Council to know that, for European socialists, this position is the very bottom line, because we are convinced that more can be done. We believe that there is room for manoeuvre within this budget and that there are many European programmes to which more resources can be allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, the members of the European Council issued a statement in which they emphasised the need to invest in growth and jobs. In June, at another Council meeting, they decided on a ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’, and yet they have done nothing to put this initiative in train.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the budget can help to do so, and, to that end, we have submitted amendments aimed at supporting all those programmes which reflect our priorities: SMEs, education, youth, research and innovation through the Seventh Framework Programme, and not forgetting development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures has the Council put in train? What budgetary measures has it taken to ensure that those programmes come to fruition? None. Not only has it made no proposals, it has even proposed cutting the budget by EUR 1 billion. It is continuing to impose austerity as the sole recipe for tackling the crisis. We told them then that they were wrong, and they didn’t take any notice of us. Unfortunately, events are now proving us correct. They are not calming the markets; macroeconomic data are not improving; deficit figures continue to escalate and, what is worse, citizens are having a very bad time of it and many countries, as a result of that austerity, no longer have a welfare state to help them to survive the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">How long is it going to take you to realise that we need to change course? Members of the Council, you carry on ploughing the same furrow – we saw it here today – not only are you cutting back on your commitments for the coming year, you are also cutting pay, just like you did last year and the year before.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavroyiannis, cutting pay means failing to fulfil commitments; it means that you have decided not to pay your bills; it means that many programmes will have to be halted, such as the Erasmus grants; it means that many of our town councils and regions will not receive the money that they have already invested in projects which are financed by European funds. This Parliament is not going to allow that to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position on this matter is unwavering and clear: if you fail to allocate the necessary money in order to prevent a recurrence of what is happening this year with regard to pay, Parliament is going to say no to your budget proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe sees it as a consequence of commitments entered into earlier. Contracts simply have to be fulfilled. If payments really need to be reduced, there is one very simple solution: to cut back on commitments. That is what the ALDE Group has tried to do in this budget procedure. We have said that it should be possible to reduce commitments by 5 % for the countries that do not make good use of their Structural Funds. Unfortunately, that proposal could not count on a majority, and we did not present it again. But we firmly believe that commitments have to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">If the budget authority – the Council and Parliament – initially voted to implement certain projects and the contracts were signed, then you can’t say later, ‘I’m afraid we need to economise now’ and ‘we don’t have the money’. That’s not on! A self-respecting government has to honour its contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, every year, money is refunded to the Member States because the accounts that are now presented to us are not submitted early enough. In the opinion of the ALDE Group, if those accounts are submitted too late, that does not mean that they no longer need to be paid. We therefore find this 6.8 % increase in the budget very hard to justify. We are fully prepared to listen to the Council, we are always willing to let ourselves be convinced, but, at the moment, we find the Commission’s arguments stronger than the Council’s. I should also like to ask the Council whether it is true that the original estimates that were submitted by the Member States were even higher than the 6.8 % that the Council is now asking for? I should be grateful for an official answer from the Council. Were the original estimates by the Member States, where the Member States were asking individually and not collectively, higher than 6.8 % or not?</p>

I deeply regret the fact that the Council can still not find the right balance between austerity and the need to boost growth at European level. We need sustainable growth! We need to make progress in combating climate change! We have to bring forward the energy revolution. We have to invest in renewable energy because that creates new jobs. And, above all, we have to instil new confidence in the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But how can you instil the hard-pressed people with new confidence when they find that, even now, in 2012, the Commission is no longer in a position to pay out the money for the European Social Fund? Surely you are sending absolutely the wrong signal here. And that is why I very strongly criticise the approach the Council is taking here, in now failing to make the necessary appropriations available for the agreements it subscribed to in the first place. Let me repeat that this undermines people’s confidence in the European project and in the European Council’s sense of responsibility. It is a wrong policy and that is why we must reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard that there are now payment problems even with programmes such as Lifelong Learning – programmes that really are directed at individual citizens, at students and schoolchildren. This situation just cannot go on! Things must change next year. If you want to create more confidence in Europe’s ability to act at European level, then you cannot cut this budget in the way the Council is currently proposing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens take the view that of course we also have to propose savings: for instance in regard to the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, which unfortunately a majority here in Parliament and in the Council want to fund. We do not think that sets the right signal at a time when we need an energy revolution and we believe that instead we must focus more on wind energy, photovoltaics and other sustainable energy sources. A brief word to say that we are prepared, even where it affects us ourselves, to handle the resources in a very responsible and careful manner. As Mr Vaughan has said, we have only a 1.9 % increase in the European budget. We MEPs could in fact save even more if we were prepared to give up short-haul business flights. I hope Members will give that some thought! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I want to mention Derek Vaughan with Parliament’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in one vital area we cannot agree: notably the overall size of the budget. This is a critical time for financing in all the Member States’ national budgets, and in particular they have an urgent need to direct all possible resources to creating jobs and restoring growth within their economies. To that end there are two ways in which we in the European Parliament can help.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we can control the size of our budgetary demands. If we do that, we reduce the burden of cost on the Member States. But secondly, we can set an example. Of course we support jobs and growth, but I consider that much of the money which we need to do that could be found from savings elsewhere in the budget – indeed, it <span class="italic">must</span> be found from savings. I also acknowledge the problems with payments caused by the ‘reste à liquider’ issue, and I would recommend that in the long term this Parliament, as a scrutinising body, needs to take steps to address this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for the 2013 budget, I urge this House to show more ambition. I urge it to support the Council’s demand for restraint by freezing the size of the budget. By doing this, it could send a very clear message to the electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The governments that announced their commitment to employment and growth at the June Summit are the same governments that have imposed unprecedented austerity on Europeans, and that have increased the number of unemployed. They also wish to make work permanently insecure and seek to withdraw all acquired rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore no surprise that their proposal on the EU budget fuels that unchecked austerity. Over the past four years, all they have been able to do is cut, and 2013 will be no different.</p>
<p class="contents">They want to make cuts in European research, education and training programmes and regional development and cohesion, as if the EUR 9 billion of cohesion funds and the European Social Fund in arrears, I repeat, in arrears, were not already enough for countries such as Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy, putting various programmes at risk, including Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Parliament is trying, to a certain extent, to reverse some of the more swingeing government cuts, such as the Seventh Framework Programme, Erasmus Mundus and Intelligent Energy, by actually going beyond the Commission proposal. It also true that the proposal has raised the appropriation for aid to Palestine, and that the European Parliament has taken the initiative to cut almost EUR 9 million from its own expenses, which I personally regard as clearly insufficient. Unfortunately, however, these proposals are not enough to change the nature of the EU budget and to counter divisive and recessionary austerity policies when solidarity-based policies are needed. In any event, one thing we cannot accept is the fact that the only institution with direct democratic legitimacy, that is, Parliament, is excluded from negotiations with the governments. For that very reason, as we have seen, leaving decisions exclusively to the governments makes no sense at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot help thinking of them today, when we are debating the 2013 budget. How do I explain to them that the Commission wants a 6.8 % increase in the 2013 budget? I can certainly tell them that subsequently the Council of national Ministers was angry about the increase and was not willing to approve it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have to tell them, though, that the European Parliament wants an even bigger increase, as much as 7 %, that is impossible for me to explain!

We cannot saddle our parents, who have built our countries up, and our children, who should be able to go on living in hope in the future, with such a terrible proposal by the Commission and this Parliament. So the most sensible thing we can do today is to throw the Commission proposal straight in the wastepaper bin and ask for a different budget proposal, this time with substantial savings and a sizeable reduction in the 2013 budget. The PVV cannot settle for less, nor, I hope, can any other sensible Members of this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">There is a problem here, but it is a political one: there are some groups and individuals here who do not understand or do not subscribe to the concept of European added value as being the way in which the Union budget has an added effect and a very positive one on the economy of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems perfectly normal to me that some MEPs should not agree with it and want to reduce the budget by around 10 % or 20 %, or indeed end up without a Community budget, and why not? That would be the best saving that you could make… My concern, however, is that the Council itself has lost sight of what European added value is. Shall I tell you why? It is because the Union budget is managed by Finance Ministers, whereas the Union budget should be discussed by Ministers for European Affairs, who have an idea of what Europe is all about, not Finance Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem points to why we will never agree on the budget and why we will never reach agreement on the forthcoming financial perspectives. The 2013 budget illustrates this point perfectly: they gave us a few commitment appropriations to enable us to launch a few Community programmes, and yet they are denying us the possibility of obtaining enough payment appropriations to carry out those programmes. By acting in this way, all we are doing is increasing the frustration of European citizens and playing into the hands of those who feel that the Union budget is pointless. It is not pointless; it is the most useful instrument we have in Europe for promoting growth and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have done a very good job at an extremely difficult time. Very few citizens are aware that there is a trend for the EU budget actually to fall as a proportion of the Member States’ economies. Most people believe that it is merely growing and growing. That is not true. It is falling despite the EU having gained new tasks and new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the European Parliament, in view of the economic crisis, is very cautious about 2013. Our proposal largely means a freeze in terms of new budget commitments. The reason why we nevertheless do not accept a cut in the budget is that we feel that it might worsen the crisis. The budget in fact consists of job-creating and growth-creating investments with a redistribution profile marked by solidarity to the benefit of the most vulnerable countries, regions, young unemployed and so on. In many of these countries, there would be no job-creating investments without EU support.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial issue appears to be the payment appropriations. This ought to be a technical issue. It ought to be self-evident that budget decisions that are taken must be implemented, that contracts must be paid for, that exchange students must receive remuneration and so on. It is simply not acceptable that important programmes such as Erasmus and the Social Fund are now finding it difficult to carry out their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assessment is that the Commission’s proposals for payment appropriations for next year are not excessive but are exactly what is needed. It is very good that Mr Lewandowski, Member of the Commission, has now started talking seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words about Parliament’s own budget. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has, for several years, advocated savings without jeopardising parliamentary work. We are now continuing with this line. We are in agreement on a rate of increase of 1.9 %, including the costs of Croatian accession. There is, in fact, a real slimming-down of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would really need to make progress on the issue of Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg. The Committee on Budgets has now, partly on my suggestion, by a large majority adopted a more detailed proposal than previously, which requires a ‘roadmap’, an action plan, in order to tackle the issue in practice. There are ways of resolving this with respect for history, without harming the city of Strasbourg and its citizens. In the longer term, it is unreasonable to adopt a solution that results in high costs every year and, in addition, is a heavy burden both on the environment and on working conditions in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, SMEs and young people once again have pride of place. In fact, however, we note with great surprise that most of the Council’s cuts are to the commitment authorisations under Heading I. That is the most important heading if we are to achieve the 2020 objectives at all. Precisely at a time of severe structural crisis, people must be offered every chance of qualifying for a job.

<p class="contents">The political objective is to fund those commitments already made, and in particular to give positive follow-up to the growth pact which was adopted by the European Council in June. Last week, the European Council drew attention to the slowness of its implementation. From our point of view, its implementation presupposes a minimum budgetary amount, concentration on research and development programmes, university exchanges and innovation under Heading 1a.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a methodological objective: to treat payment appropriations from the technical rather than the political point of view. The level of the payments has soured the budgetary debate for the past three years. It should never have become a political problem, and if it has become one, this is because the administrative machinery was badly designed. It is not working properly in the national capitals, between the national capitals and Brussels, and even in Brussels itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament we are making a specific proposal: to ask each country to centralise its requests for payment within a single authority. That central authority would verify the level of need, would certify it, make it public and convey it officially to Brussels. The Commissioner would not have to do anything more than make additions. Then the political authorities, Ministers on the one hand and Members of Parliament on the other, would negotiate again regarding the real political dimension of the budget, in other words the commitment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">As we sit here talking, programmes as important as the Social Fund, rural development, innovation, the framework research programme and Erasmus are having their payments stopped. As Commissioner Lewandowski said, we cannot leave the Union in a situation which no government wanted and which no citizen can understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The week before that, several hundred innovative enterprises took part in various conferences held at the European Parliament. A week and a half ago, I had occasion to welcome 250 young entrepreneurs who had participated in the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme to a gala dinner. Some 5 000 small-business owners have already taken part in that programme. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our words and deeds must point in the same direction! We on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy therefore consider it unacceptable that the Council and Commission have tabled a motion to curtail the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, the Research and Development Programme and the Digital Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not what we have promised, and this is not what our voters and entrepreneurs expect of us. We have promised to ensure growth and employment. I would therefore like to encourage you to adopt the motion by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Budgets to restore these lines to their original state. Commissioner, for the past two years – so we are now in the third year – we have been fighting a serious battle together to find sources of ITER funding. We consider this programme to be important, but we have also always emphasised, and would like to emphasise now, the fact that this cannot be to the detriment of other research and development programmes. I sincerely hope that we are nearing the end of this nightmare – which has been going on here for years on this point – and that this matter will be resolved in the next seven-year budget. I encourage you to think about young people, to think about the future and to invest resources in them. Thank you for listening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I applaud the efforts of Mr La Via towards this goal. It is the right way. In Italian they would probably say ‘la via correta’. This does not mean ignoring the need for budgetary restraint; cuts must be made, but they must be made in areas which do not harm our priorities. Mr Vaughan has done a great job in this direction.

The European Union budget serves not only Member States but, first and foremost, citizens. That is why we are calling in our report for an increase in funds – funds for measures to boost growth and competitiveness and for actions that will help create jobs (with a special focus on employment for young people). That is why we wish, in particular, to increase funding for programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme, which finances the Erasmus sub-programme among others. That is why we are also opposed to all cuts to cohesion policy proposed by the Council. The Structural Funds are an instrument that serves, above all, to stimulate growth and competitiveness. They are the main pillar of European solidarity, a pillar that, in this context, is unfortunately frequently forgotten. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that 2013 is the final year of the multiannual financial framework, a year in which the implementation of EU projects will be accelerated, which means a significant rise in the number of claims for the reimbursement of monies already spent by beneficiaries. The Member States should, therefore, take their cue from Parliament and agree to increase cohesion policy payments, in line with the rise proposed by the Commission. Ultimately, it is not the Member States themselves who will suffer as a result of their obstinacy, but their own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union budget is very specific in nature, being largely dedicated to initiatives and investment in areas of strategic importance for growth and employment. It should be borne in mind, therefore, that it cannot be subject to the same savings as national budgets. The creation of new jobs, so necessary in the present economic circumstances, is possible only if an adequate level of funding is guaranteed. I welcome the Council’s decision in June to maintain its position on the promotion of employment and growth, and I hope that this will also be reflected in the 2013 budget.

On buildings policy: the only reason why Parliament can still afford the luxury of two seats is quite simply that the citizens do not know enough about this silly custom. Just imagine the French Parliament meeting once a month in Marseille and, of course, charging travel and accommodation costs to the taxpayer. That would cause a huge scandal and the whole business – the travelling circus – would soon be brought to an end. Personally I would, of course, prefer Strasbourg to be the only seat because I think this Chamber seems to be a bit more stable than the one in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens know nothing about the European Parliament’s television. The idea may be a good one, as is the transparency it promotes; however, without effective funding for marketing, it is simply a waste of money.

This is not our invention. To a large extent we are taking as a basis and verifying very critically what comes from 27 Member States, both net payers into and net beneficiaries of the budget. I think Jan Mulder has posed the right question: what if we take at face value what is coming from the Member States for next year? If we took at face value – without downward revision – what was coming from the 27 Member States for next year, we should submit a draft budget which was 15 % higher for next year and not 6, 7 or 8 % higher, because we have critically revised what is coming from the Member States. It would be more or less EUR 10 billion more in the draft proposal. Mr van Dalen – who is no longer here – was asking on what planet our proposal was born. The planet is populated by the governments in The Hague, in Stockholm, in Warsaw, in Sofia, everywhere, and we are critically revising what is coming from these governments as their request for decent financing for 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the payments – the most sensitive issue in negotiations for next year – you can compare these to your monthly credit card bills. When the bills come in, it is too late to discuss them: you have to pay the bills, it is your contractual obligation to pay. That is why, especially now – at a time of austerity – we need to supplement the consolidation of public finances with a realistic growth and jobs agenda, as we have the tools in the budget, which is by nature an investment budget. However – and here it differs from national budgets – it also has macro-financing facilities for small- and medium-sized companies. Therefore we should exploit all the possibilities of the European budget rather than cut it, in clear contradiction of the announcements by the Member States in June 2013. I still remain hopeful for a decent budget for next year which will resolve the tensions of this year’s budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All your comments, criticism and disagreements are welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to make a small clarification concerning the way the Council’s position on the 2013 budget was interpreted. The Council has indeed scaled back the Commission’s proposal, but it has accepted a 2.79 % increase on the current year. That is definitely not a decrease. The Council has not made horizontal cuts across the board. We have established priorities, as suggested by Mr Torvalds, and we have examined every heading, policy and institution carefully and individually. We do not intend to let the Union run out of money. For instance, we have kept the over 8 % increase for cohesion funding, as well as the full EUR 55 billion for the European Council’s Growth and Jobs Pact referred to by Mr Lamassoure.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has certainly contributed to clarifying our respective positions. Let me assure you that the Council will do its utmost to find an agreement on the 2013 budget within the deadlines foreseen by the Treaty. Thank you very much for your attention.

<p class="contents">It seems to me that most of the speeches made by MEPs clearly show that this Parliament intends to defend the EU budget as put forward by the Commission, because we are firmly convinced that the way out of the crisis will be found in particular headings and policies of the European Union: the research policies, policies on innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises, policies on employment – these are the priorities for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have proposed selective increases to Heading 1a; and if Mr Mavroyiannis criticises our going beyond the ceiling, he should bear in mind that, within that heading, we have made cuts and found huge savings while, at the same time, having to provide – still under this heading – for EUR 360 million in additional funding for ITER, which the Council had awarded and allowed for in the current fiscal period, using all the means available – including, obviously, flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, where commitments are concerned, this Parliament has not deviated from the Commission’s proposals but has made only selective increases; and where payments are concerned, we have enough to meet our obligations. As Mr Lamassoure said, this is a technical fact, not a political one. We have to honour the commitments made in previous years – including those made by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that, during this conciliation, we will be able to reach agreement with the Council on a satisfactory level of resources that can guarantee that the European budget has the necessary sums to invest in growth, development and job creation, and a sum for payments that is sufficient to honour all the commitments that have been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was pleased that one colleague recognised and accepted the need for the small increase in the Ombudsman’s budget for 2013, due to accommodation and staffing pressures. Another colleague mentioned the House of European History. People will be aware that many Members of this House are quite sceptical about that particular project. I wanted to say that for next year we are proposing a EUR 5.3 million cut in the budget line for that particular project. Another colleague mentioned the issue of the single seat. Again I would say that there will be a vote tomorrow, therefore colleagues will have the opportunity to express their views and opinions on the issue of the single seat.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to emphasise to colleagues that the joint working group I mentioned in my first contribution is still meeting. It is still looking at some of the issues raised by Helga Trüpel, on Members’ travel for example. It is also looking at a comparative study of the administrative expenditure of this House and that of the US Congress and Member States’ parliaments. That work is ongoing, and we hope to have the final report on that at the end of the year. When we get that report, hopefully we can make some further recommendations in terms of savings for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of that particular joint working group and of me myself has always been one thing, and I will say it again for colleagues: to find efficiency savings – because it is possible to find these in this Parliament – but also to protect the effectiveness of Members and of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although I know many Members think we should go further and find more savings, I also know that many Members feel that we have already gone too far and made too many savings. Hopefully, at the end of the day, we will reach a compromise which tomorrow will be acceptable to most Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, to emerge from the crisis, we certainly need a policy of discipline, but equally we have to put the question of the nature of our expenses in the foreground as we make our choices; otherwise this will turn into indiscriminate cuts which can do nothing but stifle the already tentative signs of economic upturn in Europe. As the rapporteur has pointed out, 2013 is the last year of the current multiannual financial framework, and it is essential to respect the balance between the commitments that we have taken on up until now and the payments that these entail. Having said that, I am concerned about the data presented by the European Commissioner for the Budget, Janusz Lewandowski, on the shortfalls that are having an impact on every item in the European budget – in particular about the cuts to the Erasmus Programme. Although I am well aware that the general trend in politics in relation to the budget for 2013 largely reflects views on the negotiations for the next programming cycle of 2014-2020, I would point out the importance of continuity at a time when we are supporting investment in training programmes for our young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to give MEPs, the only members of parliament directly elected in the EU, the right to decide for themselves their working place arrangements. It seems to me even more logical to give them that right when any decision on a single seat would, according to the latest estimates, reduce the operating costs of the EP by EUR 200 million a year. In addition to this saving, doing away with the monthly shuttles between Brussels and Strasbourg would reduce Parliament’s carbon footprint by 20 000 tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span> a year. I am therefore delighted with today’s vote, whereby a large majority of Members are asking Member States to re-examine the issue of the EP’s seat and workplaces at the next revision of the Treaty, by amending Protocol No 6. Once again, today’s vote gives a clear signal that MEPs are willing to play a full part in the budgetary and environmental efforts of EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simultaneously, 25 million unemployed people in Europe keep reminding us of the importance of restarting investment, boosting job creation and rebuilding confidence in our economy. In this respect the EU’s budget should be seen as an investment tool to support recovery and long-term development. The 2013 budget strikes a balance between austerity and growth by maintaining support to investments in programmes and initiatives for competitiveness and employment, while keeping the levels of increase for the institutions’ budgets below the forecast inflation rate of 1.9 %. In the light of this, I deplore the Council’s approach, which seeks to make horizontal cuts in payments, especially under Headings 1a and 1b, where most of the programmes and initiatives responsible for the Europe 2020 strategy are concentrated. Such an approach puts at risk the fulfilment of commitments previously undertaken, as well as the delivery of jointly-decided EU priorities. Instead I wish to remind the Council that real savings can be made elsewhere, for example by reducing the working places of the Parliament to one. Our budget must represent and address the need of our citizens to overcome the current crisis and restore growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quality of our budget will allow for a better development of the policies, taking full advantage of the opportunities they provide in terms of European value added, in particular in times of heavy constraint on the national budgets. Today, growth in Europe has been stunted because of the severe austerity measures many countries are facing. For this reason the EU budget must, more than ever, work to increase growth and jobs through research, development and innovation, and the better governance of the policies including certain conditionalities, flexibility, positive incentives, concentration of funds on growth-enhancing measures, emphasis on results, and simplification in delivery. Further to this it should aim to support long-term development and strategic European cooperation, and give additional support to Member States that are currently struggling to overcome the crisis. For this reason, I agree that further negotiation on EU financing must be reasonable and give due importance to programmes such as Erasmus, research and cohesion policy, and strive to make the EU budget a fairer, more transparent and more accountable mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By implementing this regulation we will prevent the misuse of information and manipulation in the electricity and gas market. Limited financial funds move its implementation into the future.

Even though intensive discussions are taking place regarding next year’s EU budget, we must not forget that despite our differences of opinion, our common goal is the welfare of the Member States and their citizens. For this reason, I would like to draw attention to those positions proposed by the European Parliament that are important, balanced and ensure implementation of the most important EU priorities. First of all, it is very important to ensure the continuation of projects currently financed by the EU. We cannot stop something that the European Union itself encourages based on its priorities. I am glad that next year’s budget focuses on economic growth, competitiveness and youth employment. It is very important that the EU supports long-term investments in research, development and innovation (RDI), and financing the Member States’ recovery is just as much a priority. I understand the Member States’ objections to cost cutting in order to reduce their respective budget deficits, but we should not forget that EU budget funds are targeted towards future investment in our own countries. Economic growth is based on the development of energy, innovation, scientific research and education. Therefore, not only does the continuation of current programmes have to be ensured, but new programmes that have been clearly defined in the European Union’s priorities must also be created and financed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent contributions, the Danish and Cyprus Presidencies for successfully concluding the trialogues and the administrators for their valuable assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, EU citizens today feel disappointed about the ongoing economic crisis, rising unemployment and the lack of effective solutions. Brussels seems far away; important decisions are taken for them without them; the lack of information and language problems remain persistent barriers preventing full enjoyment of Union citizenship within the EU and in cross-border situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the great disappointment, it is, however, encouraging that the vast majority of European citizens have not turned their backs on the EU. They still consider EU membership to be a good thing, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey of August 2012. A better and deeper Europe is, however, required.</p>
<p class="contents">Further discussions on European integration require strong democratic support. EU political leaders and institutions must endorse the concerns of 500 million European citizens, fulfil their expectations and regain their trust. At a time of economic, political, and social crisis only twenty months before the next European elections, putting Union citizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly the aim of the European Year of Citizens 2013: to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Union citizenship by the Treaty of Maastricht and to give a new momentum to the debate on Union citizenship. All EU citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all the rights granted to them by Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, i.e. the right to move and reside freely within the EU, to vote and to stand as candidates in European and municipal elections; to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State in a third country; to petition the European Parliament; to apply to the European Ombudsman; to address the institutions of the Union; to enjoy the free movement of goods and services, consumer protection, public health, equal opportunities, equal treatment, access to employment and social protection; to enjoy the new right of the European Citizens Initiative granted by the Lisbon Treaty, and to strengthen participative democracy through access to documents, information, good governance and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, all the initiatives launched for the European Year of Citizens should enhance awareness of Union citizenship, improve understanding of European integration and enhance cooperation among Union citizens, institutions and Member States. As Members of the European Parliament – the only directly elected EU institution – we have a crucial role to play in promoting the aims of the European Year of Citizens 2013 by bridging the gap between Brussels and Member States, communicating the rights and benefits of EU citizenship, endorsing citizens’ concerns in formulating EU policies and promoting participative democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the forthcoming European elections, we must raise awareness of the legislative powers of the European Parliament and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heard clearly by EU decision-makers. A Union of growth, stability and solidarity can only be built with the active involvement of well-informed active citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreas Mavroyiannis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I would like to begin my remarks this afternoon by welcoming the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The designation of 2013 as the European Year of Citizens is an important signal that we want to increase public awareness of the rights and responsibilities of citizens across the European Union. We hope, in particular, that it will highlight the rights of citizens to move and reside freely within the European Union. These issues are all the more important in the run-up to the European elections of 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this Parliament which first proposed this initiative at the end of 2010. At that time you highlighted the need to stimulate discussion on Union citizenship and to inform Union citizens of their rights, in particular those resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are happy that the idea was taken up and moved forward by Commissioner Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty on European Union first introduced the concept of citizenship of the Union, so next year will mark the 20th anniversary. It is therefore particularly appropriate that 2013 will be designated as the Year of Citizens. The Cyprus Presidency, building on the work of the Danish Presidency, was able to conclude negotiations on this proposal in the first few weeks of its term in office. I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Papadopoulou, for her enthusiasm for this initiative and for her willingness to negotiate in such a cooperative manner with the Council. I welcome the vote that will be taking place this week on this proposal and have no doubt that the initiative will be strongly endorsed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The general objective of the European Year of Citizens in 2013 is to enhance awareness and knowledge of the rights – but also of the responsibilities – attached to Union citizenship. As is clear from the legal basis chosen by the Commission, the proposal aimed first and foremost to help citizens to make full use of their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the context of free movement, the European Year will also provide an opportunity to promote other rights. The free movement of persons is one of the four basic freedoms, but at the same time there is clearly also a way to bridge the gap between what the rules state and how they operate in practice. Citizens still encounter difficulties when moving to another Member State, whether as workers, students, entrepreneurs, job seekers or consumers. It is therefore essential that all citizens are fully aware of their legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative will also provide an opportunity to raise awareness of other rights related to free movement, such as the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament and in local elections in the Member State of residence, the right to petition the European Parliament, the right to apply to the European Ombudsman and the right to address EU institutions, as well as a wide range of other rights, such as the free movement of goods and services, consumer protection and public health, equal opportunities and equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much hope that this proposal will play an important role in encouraging and empowering citizens to uphold their right to engage actively at European level, not least in view of the 2014 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Year of Citizens is not a one-off event. It now needs to seek the launch of a longer-term process of building awareness and encouraging participation. I know this Parliament has a pivotal role in ensuring that this is the case. We also look forward to the 2013 European Union citizenship report, which will assess progress in this area and propose further initiatives to remove the obstacles which prevent citizens from fully enjoying their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important decision which serves the interest of all our citizens. All of us – this Parliament as well as our own national governments and parliaments – have a role in helping to increase awareness of what it means to be a citizen of the European Union. We are ready to play our role. I have no doubt that the European Parliament will be very active, not just in 2013 but also beyond, in highlighting this message.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Year of Citizens 2013 will take place in a very special context, as next year also marks the 20th anniversary of EU citizenship, as introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. This is an opportunity to illustrate, with concrete examples, the benefits of EU citizenship in the daily lives of students, residents, tourists, workers, private individuals and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to provide the second so-called ‘citizenship report’ on how to remove the remaining obstacles and barriers which make it difficult, in daily life, for European citizens to move around Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The year also falls on the eve of the European elections. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to remind people that participation is legally possible wherever citizens may reside in the European Union. As mentioned already, this is a matter of raising awareness of the real value of citizenship, going beyond participation in the democratic life of the European Union, as already described on many occasions, to the rights to consular protection and to petition the European Parliament, address the Institutions and apply to the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, this is an opportunity to highlight the prerogatives of this assembly, which is an assembly of people elected by the people. I am happy now that we have a solid basis between the institutions, and I am sure that together we can make the European Year of Citizens a real success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowadays, however, the fact remains that public opinion and the workers of various countries increasingly perceive the EU as an area of inequality, exploitation and wage slavery, in which the rights that people have conquered over centuries of struggle are being eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">Let’s be honest: rather than an area of free movement of persons, the European Union is, in fact, an area of free movement of capital and goods for the benefit of international monopolies. To talk about the free movement of persons nowadays is to talk primarily about the reality of millions of workers who are unable to remain in their own country and are forced to seek a livelihood for their families by emigrating.</p>
<p class="contents">In this very difficult context, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs draws attention to the need to defend workers’ social security and trade union rights without discrimination of any kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say, ‘What a long way we have come!’, not least because our discussions with the Council, under the Danish Presidency, did not get off to a very good start. It has to be said that the initial proposal was unacceptable to Parliament. We could not allow a European Year of Citizens with no reference to citizenship, to the way in which citizens can become more involved in the operation of our institutions and in the definition of the EU policies which given them all their place. Moreover, we are aware that we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We could not allow people to say that, if a gulf was opening up between the European institutions and their citizens, it was only because those citizens failed to appreciate their rights as regards freedom of movement. We know how things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens cannot be regarded simply as consumers who fail to appreciate their rights, and who are given a chance to vote in the European elections every five years. Education and culture also have their place in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we are blazing a trail here, making a start on the great integration project that is European citizenship, at the same time, of course, respecting the competencies of each Member State. I have only one regret, and that is that we have not given ourselves the resources to enable us to do the job.</p>

<p class="contents">I hope that this initiative will become a reality and not remain mere rhetoric.

We lay particular stress on the right of citizens to free movement, partly as a means of attaining the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and as such we believe that the movement of young people, particularly students, is of vital importance for the European Union. It is also important for citizens to be informed about their rights, specifically through the European e-Justice portal. However, Mr President, I would like to send a message, because we emphasise these major ideas, we applaud them, but in reality we undermine them. The economic crisis we are going through has ruptured relations with citizens. I hope that the European Union will be given the opportunity to rebuild these relations.

<p class="contents">In 2013 we will be celebrating the European Year of Citizens, 20 years after the concept of European citizenship arose, when it was accepted by the European Union. This is linked not only to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital, and mainly people, not only to cross-border relations and cooperation, but also to citizens’ rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, for instance the citizens’ initiative and the right of consultation, which have enormous significance.</p>
<p class="contents">If today there is a drawback in the EU, it is precisely that many of its citizens only have a general and limited picture of the EU, but do not know who does what, what their responsibilities are and at what level they act. Since governments usually believe or say that anything good comes from national governments and, by contrast, anything unpleasant comes from Brussels, the European Year of Citizens could provide the opportunity for us to understand things better, for us to raise awareness among European citizens so that they perceive that it is possible to have both access to information and also participation. Of course, Mr President, the new report that is being prepared on the European political parties deals with providing access to and direct participation in the European political parties, and this will give great flexibility, help the national political parties and in general give citizens a better understanding of what the European Union is and where it is going. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this year will be truly successful if European citizens see that they actually can assert their rights, and that the institutions of the European Union take their own fundamental principles and values seriously. Can citizens actually exercise the right to work in another country and have their qualifications recognised? Does the right to non-discrimination actually apply to everyone, for example those who seek their fortune in another Member State as Roma? Does the European Union take the guarantee of democratic rights seriously, and will it speak out if democracy is violated in any Member State and people cannot enjoy their democratic rights?</p>
<p class="contents">They are curious to know whether they can enjoy their social rights, and whether the fundamental principle of solidarity works. Will those who have been hit hardest by the crisis receive help? Will solidarity also manifest itself in the budget after 2014? If we can make progress in these areas, I think this year will be a successful one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk about a banking union, a monetary union, a political union, but none of that can become an enduring reality if we do not strengthen the identity associated with it. I believe that this is one of the purposes served by the year we have been discussing. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we have talked only about rights. In my opinion, it is time to begin discussing citizens’ responsibilities too. It is not just a question of freedom of movement; citizenship of any country carries with it responsibilities. One of these responsibilities – and also a privilege – is the duty to vote. In some countries, it is not uncommon for the turnout in parliamentary elections to be 20 to 25 % or 30 % of the electorate. I think that we need to focus on this issue, as there are people – I have met some of them – who are not even aware that they are entitled to vote in European Parliament elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Our budget for this year is obviously limited, but I think that we MEPs need to start thinking about how and what to communicate. We must begin to exchange best practice. It is here that we must forge the European identity that we will promote. This is not an issue that can be addressed for us by the institution or through programmes. It is we who, in our conversations with people, must deliver the message. I therefore call on Members to use their time here to exchange best practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1993 the Treaty of Maastricht introduced the concept of Union citizenship, and the Treaty of Amsterdam and then the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 reinforced the rights associated with Union citizenship. The Union-related rights of citizens have expanded, but this is still not enough, in my view. What is needed above all for Union identity to become a reality is the trust of Union citizens. They must assert these rights, which are enshrined in the Treaties, in practice too. The institutions, chiefly the Commission and Parliament, must strive to engage in dialogue with citizens. We must ensure equal opportunities and rights for all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that not all Union citizens will be able to exercise their rights properly until discriminatory legal provisions are erased from the legal systems of the Member States, without exception. As an example of this, I would like to mention the Slovak nationality law and the discriminatory parts of the Beneš Decrees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I urge that those obstacles still preventing people from exercising their rights as EU citizens should be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would stress the importance of eliminating the barriers that stand in the way of the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers. We cannot truly speak of European citizenship while barriers and differences exist between the citizens of Member States. That is why I ask that, no later than the first quarter of 2013, all barriers imposed by some Member States against Romanian and Bulgarian workers should be lifted.

Under any civil law contract, such a serious change – and let me remind you that the Treaties actually include a bail-out clause – would require the assent of all parties concerned. In this case, the parties most concerned are, without doubt, the citizens and taxpayers, not the governments, nor the Commission. Citizens must have an opportunity to vote directly in their country on whether they want a conversion, a transfer operation, or whether they want the EU converted into a federal state.

I welcome the fact that the Cypriot Presidency was very positive in receiving our messages and in fact did a very good job in bringing this dossier to completion. I trust that we will soon have available to us the second report on European citizenship, which will contain specific actions to overcome the barriers faced by the 500 million European citizens, and I trust that the citizens’ charter will also be created, because we need it.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe in a better Europe, we will work to ensure that this year is a successful year, and I regret the fact that EUR 1 million is not enough. I trust that there will be second thoughts and that the amount will be increased, because we requested EUR 5 million and in the end I heard that only EUR 2 million would be approved. Other European years had EUR 11 million, and even more, available to them. I understand that this is a time of crisis, but nevertheless, if we want citizens to be at the heart of our policies and if we want more Europe and better Europe, then the right actions and good provision of information to citizens are needed. We believe in participatory democracy and this is the road towards a better future in the European family to which we belong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the fundamental aims that the EU wants to achieve is an increase in European citizens’ awareness of their rights, freedoms and opportunities for political participation. I welcome this impulse and will support it through my activities in the European Parliament. I shall also highlight other areas covered by this Year of Citizens: access to information for all EU citizens, support of equal opportunities for women and development of citizens’ mutual respect and European awareness. Therefore, I consider it vital to support the education of citizens – both the younger and the older generations – in areas which help to strengthen European awareness and identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives in the regions of the individual Member States are very important, because it is precisely in the local sphere that political and civic activities originate.

In addition to being Polish citizens, we also feel and are European. As Europeans, too, we should show awareness and commitment. I am certain that, as a result of the European Year of Citizens, awareness of the rights associated with European citizenship will improve. Campaigns will be organised to explain the rights enjoyed by those who study, work, set up businesses or spend their retirement in other Member States. The year 2013 will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of EU citizenship. The rights of every citizen are guaranteed by the European Treaties, including the right to move and settle within another Member State, to vote and stand in European and local elections and to petition the European Parliament.

Citizens are more and more facing fatigue from Europe and feeling politics at European level distancing itself from the people. In these crucial times in which we seek to deepen European integration, it is essential that our citizens understand and support the efforts of politicians and institutions. Citizens are the backbone of the EU and if we want to achieve true political and economic integration, we cannot bypass the people who would actually make it happen. We have to engage in meaningful dialogue and consultation with our citizens on European issues. Also, one year before the European elections, we need to step up our efforts to explain European-level politics and political parties. For the first time, European parties will be able to campaign, and this provides an excellent opportunity to have a real European debate at all levels across Europe.

It cannot be denied that there has been progress on free market issues and the free movement of persons. However, for further progress to be made on European integration, it is vital to find a basis for European civic identity. This must be based on EU citizens’ sense of belonging and solidarity and on strengthening the democratic elements of its decision-making. As a matter of principle, the European Union must, in the framework of the European Year of Citizens (EYC 2013), strengthen knowledge about the existing rights of EU citizens. Awareness of EU citizens’ rights will create a generalised pressure on the representatives of Member States, facilitating a more intensive integration process. Therefore EYC 2013 is a very important initiative. All the European institutions, in co-operation with civil society, should try to improve the general level of knowledge about such fundamental matters. One especially important, responsible task is to create new stimuli for the section of European civil society that supports a more profound integration process. As the sole EU body elected by citizens, the European Parliament must play a leading role in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU uses the Year of 2013 as an opportunity to involve citizens in constructing and developing the programme.

<p class="contents">It cannot stay the same because the world has changed. These days, 7 out of 10 poor people in the world are living not in the least developed countries or the developing countries but in the emerging countries. Admittedly, globalisation is creating considerable wealth, but not all of it filters through to the least well off.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, we have the explosive rate of population growth. Today, the planet has seven billion mouths to feed. In 20 years’ time, the figure will be nine billion. A country’s economic growth is only real when the economy is growing faster than the birth rate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the 21st century, the European Union’s influence in the world will steadily fall away in what some call a ‘strategic decline’, in contrast to that of the emerging countries whose booming economies have already made them confident political players.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, the European Union is far and away the world’s leading provider of public-sector development aid. It aspires not only to remain the leading player in this field, but also to be the best one.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that this remains the case in the future too, the Committee on Development envisages the following way forward. The European Union’s development policy pursues the noblest of all objectives, namely to promote human dignity by eradicating poverty, nothing more, nothing less. Public-sector aid to development must be tailored to the needs of our partners in the South, respecting the choices they make. Development policy must help the poor, with no hidden agenda, and must be consistent with the European Consensus on Development as reflected in the statement agreed by the Council, Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see Lady Ashton signing the relevant document too, so that there is not the slightest doubt as to the intentions of all the European institutions concerning development. We call on all those involved – private-sector players, wealthy nations, poor nations, multilateral organisations – to shoulder their development responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we endorse the wish of the European Commission to provide its aid on a differentiated basis and to strike the emerging countries, with their booming economies, off the list of beneficiaries. The alleviation of poverty in these countries must no longer be a matter for international solidarity but must now be a domestic policy concern. Our Committee would like this to come about through dialogue with these countries and a gradual withdrawal of the European Union from giving them aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Piebalgs favours inclusive growth in the developing countries. We agree with that approach. With the proviso that the promotion of growth in the developing countries, as in Europe too, must bring about a real improvement in the lot of the poorest. Account must be taken of this in the programming of aid. So we believe that at least 20 % of EU aid must go towards basic social services as defined by the United Nations in its Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union policy must be consistent, coherent. Coherence means that departments other than that concerned with development must be persuaded to abandon any action which might undermine what has been achieved in development cooperation. Our 27 Member States must be aware of this and must act accordingly so that, operating as 28, along with the Commission, the External Action Service, they fulfil the requirement of coordinated action stipulated in the Lisbon Treaty. Your rapporteur believes that the dialogue amongst the 28 is far from good enough, in terms of ministers’ attendance at Council meetings and the extremely limited time allocated to this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that, before we take decisions, there must be a meeting of minds on the main strategic issues which determine the European Union’s development policy. An independent think tank at European level, providing real added value, real added value over and above that provided by existing national bodies, might be better placed to guide us in our response to the major challenges of development. I will spare you the detail, which you can find in my written report.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are aware, this matter of development receives insufficient attention in public debate. To remedy that state of affairs, and this is the purpose of the oral question I added to my request for this report, we ask Parliament to approve our motion to have 2015 declared the European Year for Development. This request is supported by Thijs Berman, Philippe Boulland and Eva Joly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need responsible development? Because the Millennium Development Goals will never be attained if the mid-income countries, where 7 out of 10 people are poor, do not shoulder their responsibilities. We need it because the imperative of policy coherence requires us too, in the European Union, to rethink a number of our methods. If we want to remain relevant here in 2015, it seems to me that 2015 is none too soon a date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware that the European Union provides over half of the world’s public-sector development aid. Even so, as the 2015 deadline for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals draws near, whilst some of the goals do seem to have been achieved, we need to think about how we can improve our aid and make it more coherent with our trade policy, our agricultural policy and our foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of European development policy must be built on specific, measurable commitments tied to a short- and medium-term timetable. </p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis, climate change, the power of the emerging countries, land grabbing, all these things force us to set new priorities: guaranteeing food security, access to energy resources and access to health care. There is agreement in Europe on these things, yes, but we must rethink our European and international institutional systems for dealing with environmental and social issues, modelling ourselves on decision-making bodies like the WTO, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and above all, we must make it clear to our fellow citizens that development aid to third countries is more than charity and solidarity; it is also a source of development for us. We need only look at the markets opening up to Europeans in the emerging countries of China, Brazil and India.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2015 will also be a time to look more closely at the geostrategic changes of recent years, because today’s emerging countries were still developing countries not all that long ago. As undeniable economic powers, these countries must now make their own contribution to the international aid effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be a promoter of responsible development aid at European and at international level. The year 2015 will be more than a landmark date; it will be a unique opportunity for rethinking development aid, not merely as financial assistance, but as backing for responsible development projects in both the social and environmental field.</p>
<p class="contents">I thus join with members of the other groups and the members of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in calling for 2015 to be designated the European Year for Development and, above all, responsible development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Agenda for Change rightly says that there must be a closer link between emergency aid and development policy. In my Member State, the Netherlands, people are saying that we should simply confine ourselves to emergency aid, which is a ridiculous idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in Mali, for instance, it is disastrous and not in our interests simply to offer emergency aid. Not to look beyond famine amongst the refugees in northern Mali only benefits the Muslim fanatics who are establishing Sharia law there, despite fierce opposition from the local population. That offers Al Qaeda a safe haven, so that northern Mali becomes a hotbed, an Afghanistan close to our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look away from northern Mali, that is also to the advantage of Latin American criminals who are increasingly free to transport cocaine to Europe across the Sahara, via ports in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau. Taking action, on the other hand, means supporting the peace initiative and working actively in Mali towards a future for the region, for the Tuareg as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2015, we need to have global talks about how to ensure from then on that everyone has the possibility of escaping poverty. That calls for a public debate. It would be a good idea for the European Union to declare 2015 the year of development cooperation. I should like to ask Commissioner Piebalgs whether he can support us in achieving that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, without open democracy, equal opportunities are an illusion. As long as the poorest have no voice in their capital cities, their interests are not taken into account there. It is, therefore, important to invest in making the voices of the poorest heard, in local and regional parliaments, in social organisations, such as NGOs for minorities and women. The European Commission is opting for that approach, with the backing of the European Parliament. I hope that the Council will also be able to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I should start by thanking Charles Goerens for an excellent report and also for the debate we have started here. It definitely requires far more attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful to the Committee on Development, in which we have the chance always to exchange views on development policy. Development cooperation is definitely one of the most complicated policies because it revolves not only around the development support that we give, but also around our action in other policy areas. It is also true, as Mr Boulland said, that we should see development policy not only from the perspective of solidarity. Solidarity is definitely part of our approach, but it is also an investment in the security and the well-being of our citizens. I believe it is very much a cross-cutting policy that strengthens the Union if properly addressed and weakens the Union if not properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there have been substantial changes in the world for the better. We now have a chance, in our lifetime, not only to alleviate poverty but also, in many parts of the world, to eradicate it. The EU is a trusted partner because we always keep our promises. Sometimes, perhaps, we are slow, but we are honest in our approach, with no second thoughts. We just want to help countries get out of the circle of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In addressing this agenda of change, we really need to work more strategically, and when you work more strategically you definitely need to make some choices. Our point of departure is the human rights-based approach, which we do not separate from health policy, education policy or support for growth sectors. It is an over-arching element that we address in all policy elements in a coherent manner. I am very glad that Mr Goerens’s report looks positively on the movement towards inclusive and sustainable growth, because we can also see what our partners are looking for. They would like fast, immediate growth, and GDP growth of two figures, and if possible three figures, while not always understanding that GDP growth figures do not always result in satisfaction for the funded nation and that the elements of social inclusion and social protection are very important, and that the sustainability issue is also crucial. Does it help a country to have high growth, only to find it is devastating the environment? We are trying to build a coherent approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe two issues are crucial here. One is access to sustainable energy. We know that this is crucial not only in the fight against climate change, but also for economic growth. If we are not there, then it will most probably be coal-based power that is used in some parts of the country. The second issue is food security, agriculture and nutrition. What Mr Berman said is true: if you just take humanitarian aid, you will never have enough money to address matters, because calamities are happening more and more and this has a higher and higher cost. It does not help if you just save people’s lives in a time of calamity – they also need to rebuild their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done, together with my colleague Kristalina Georgieva, with regard to built resilience provides an answer. This is where you can save money and where you can move out, saying that, at a certain stage of development, our support will not be necessary, because the country is strong enough and has built resilience to address its food insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goerens touched upon dialogue with the Member States, and things have evolved in the Development Council. It is perhaps not the most important sign, but in May we will hold a whole-day Development Council under the chairmanship of the High Representative, Vice-President Ashton. Although she has a busy agenda, she has agreed to hold a whole-day event. This demonstrates that we have issues to discuss, and she feels confident that the Member States will be fully involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Another benchmark is joint programming. I am glad that there is a French initiative to hold an event on joint programming. It is not only a Commission-driven process. This is what we are looking for, so that Member States feel fully comfortable with the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, international engagement. We sometimes say that we are misunderstood, but I believe now that we have a real historic chance in the MDG process up to 2015 and after. The MDG Framework is the most developed and widely-recognised international global framework. That framework really has changed the lives of millions of people, and 2015 is the year in which we conclude the process of the MDGs and, from another point of view, we also start a new framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the EU should be fully engaged in this major event and consider this the most important year for development cooperation; it is really a landmark year for us. So, for this reason, I believe that organising a European Year for Development in 2015 could be both timely and appropriate. At EU level it could help catalyse and mobilise the attention both of public opinion and of the decision-makers on development issues, in particular on the post-2015 development framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to note the support of the Committee of the Regions and of the President of this House on this issue. The Commission is now looking at the implications of the organisation of this European Year. We need also to mobilise significant human resources to ensure the full success of such a large-scale campaign. We are looking at it positively, but we need to be absolutely sure that we, as Europe, can deliver on this Year before we start it. The Commission will come back to Parliament with detailed proposals, in line with the proper procedure for the designation of a European Year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also call the attention of this House, as a component of the budgetary authority, to the need to ensure sufficient financial resources in order to secure the successful organisation of such a European Year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Charles Goerens for drafting this important report. I share the Commission’s eagerness to pay particular attention to improving the quality of assistance. It is clear that, at times of crisis, we must be exceptionally careful about how we spend taxpayers’ money. Nor is there any doubt that our development policy itself needs to be modernised. If the world is changing, and changing very quickly, then our response to the world’s problems and ills should keep pace with those changes. The Agenda for Change is an attempt to do just that, and I hope that it will be successful. The concept of inclusive growth, which the Commissioner referred to just now, involves reconciling economic growth with progress in meeting social needs. This concept actually builds on a very European and long-established model – the social market economy. It prevents us from losing sight of the basic aim of economic development, which is to reduce poverty. Our desire is for a development policy that is coherent, effective, balanced and well coordinated. I believe that the Agenda for Change, our report and the European Year for Development will bring us closer to achieving that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His report comes at a time of Europe-wide cuts in official development aid, expiry of the time limit set for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015 and full negotiation of the next multiannual financial framework; specifically, the development cooperation instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The message which Parliament is going to support tomorrow is a forceful one: times are changing, circumstances are changing, but we Europeans, even in difficult times, are in favour of solidarity and development, and we have a cooperation agenda which is in tune with those changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is therefore supportive of policies which favour sustainable development and promote the redistribution of wealth and social justice, whose financing is commensurate with global targets. It is also urging that the 70 % of poor people in the world who live in middle-income countries should not be denied our support. We are therefore asking that a roadmap be negotiated aimed at gradual reduction of official development aid, that their involvement in triangular cooperation agreements be actively promoted and that the differentiation criterion for granting or not granting our aid be based not just on gross national income but also on other indicators, such as current inequality or vulnerability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we are asking for a lot, even for revenue from the tax on European Union financial transactions to be used, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for development cooperation; but we are asking this advisedly, in the knowledge that European Union aid is effective and has a genuine added value and also that it continues to be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are three brief points I want to make. The first is that we need to ensure that there is a favourable environment in which economies in developing countries can grow. This means getting public expenditure in order, making sure it is efficient, and creating a healthy private sector as well as removing excessive burdens on SMEs – small and medium-sized enterprises. We cannot do that on our own, but we can encourage that and we can talk about that and we can get involved with other politicians and try to get that on their agenda. In addition, we need to protect and further develop property rights in order to also serve that agenda. That is what we will give people: an ownership, and a sense of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we really do need to address the issue of policy coherence. The Commission itself pointed out that there could be up to EUR 6 billion per year saved if there was greater coherence in our development policy. There needs to be some way for this Parliament to speak with national parliaments, and I urge the Commissioner to use his influence to help us bring that about. We are trying to do that through the Committee on Development so we can bypass reluctant ministers in the Council of Ministers who want to keep all this power to themselves and are exacerbating the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and very briefly, the Commissioner attended a launch on gendercide. I am the rapporteur on gendercide. There are up to 200 million women missing in the world because of gender-based abortion and infanticide. We can change that. We can challenge that. We can bring about a difference that makes it clear you do not need to favour men over women for economic reasons. We have got to make that an issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In view of the current – difficult – economic and budgetary situation, it is all the more essential for us to make sure that aid is spent effectively and produces the best possible outcome. Resources must be directed more accurately to where they are most needed to reduce poverty. We must give more thought to a differentiated approach on how we give aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Agenda for Change, the Commission proposes to target its aid on agriculture, prioritising locally developed practices and concentrating on small farm holdings. So it is imperative that the Commission really does focus on aid to the agricultural sector and nutrition in its programming for the period 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, effective action against poverty also requires a strengthening of synergies and the strategic meshing of humanitarian aid with development aid. This is necessary in order to establish a robust system and launch a process of sustainable development. So 2015 must be the year of development – I would venture to say, sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet, as the rapporteur has rightly pointed out, the political dialogue between international actors, as well as the cooperation between Member States, the Commission and the EEAS, is still in a quite disorganised state.

<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that when discussing development policy we should be thinking of a much wider range of recipients than the ACP countries only.

Firstly, it requires sufficient resources which are at least consistent with the commitments made and with the objectives laid down at international level, particularly in the framework of the UN. It must also be altered to allow developing countries to take greater ownership of aid that can foster their sovereign development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with concern that we face trends and orientations such as a change in budget support and state subsidies for so-called blending mechanisms, which weaken and undermine aid and introduce uncertainty where predictability is required. It is with equal concern that we face the imposition, under the guise of ‘good governance’, of practices and policies in many fields, such as economic organisation, taxation, justice and others. These policies must arise out of developing country choices and options, in line with their situation and specific conditions, rather than being exported from Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">To Mr Kaczmarek: I believe that what we are trying to do is to make aid a catalyst to achieve the results, plus with PCD – Policy Coherence for Development – where we could achieve definitely even more and stronger change. I would definitely say that our PHARE initiative is transparency in extractive industries, as was proposed by my colleague Mr Barnier. If we capitalise, we really can make a substantial change. I would very much like to thank him for his support for the agenda for change.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Cortés Lastra: we have discussed differentiation for a long time. Differentiation is not an ambition per se. Differentiation is just the realities of what is happening in the world. But we are keeping new instruments, like cooperation instruments, that we will continue to use with our partner countries. In a lot of countries, we should continue the poverty eradication strategy because the economic level and size of the countries definitely require other forms of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Sargentini: we are investing and changing our approach during this period’s financial framework, according to the agenda for change.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Younous: Africa is our absolute priority, because Africa is make or break. It could be a continent of prosperity and it could be a continent of complete disaster. So I believe that our engagement with Africa is crucial, because no one else will support the African nations in their quest for prosperity. In my contacts with African countries I believe that they are very much looking to Europe, not only for money but also very much for encouragement and their development. If we can capitalise on that, I believe Africa would be the driver of world growth, not the continent where there is currently the most insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding what Mr Mitchell said, we also work with the private sector and others, because this also strengthens the human rights agenda. If you just speak about the human rights agenda without addressing small and medium-sized enterprises and property rights, it is always vulnerable, but if you have a broader discussion, then this helps. Also in regard to what he said about the gendercide issue, we have worked on this and we should continue to do so because it is clearly a human rights agenda but it really needs a push.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mitchell’s idea about the European Parliament and national parliaments is very interesting and we should reflect on this. I started by being too shy with national parliaments. I came to national parliaments to speak with them as if starting from scratch and discovered with pleasure that they are actually much more engaged than we usually suspect, because these are some of the policies that everybody wants. What type of world will we be living in? I think that is why I believe the debate is essential. It is not just a question of how much money we have to give. It is actually concerns the world we are living in now and the world we would like to live in in 15 or 20 years, and the debate is very much alive.</p>
<p class="contents">To Ms Striffler: agriculture, food security and nutrition will remain our priority area, and there we have a new initiative. We have put in place for the first time a nutrition obligation to reduce the number of children left stunted by seven million by 2025. For me, if there is a poverty phase – and actually this phase is a post-2015 development agenda – it is a malnourished child, because it is a shame that it has happened and we know how difficult it is to achieve. As long as there is one child in such a situation, we will not have done our duty. I believe it is very crucial that we focus on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Fisas Ayxela and differentiation, it is true that there will be pockets of poverty in China, but I believe that if we have a definite global framework and China does what it is committing itself to – fighting poverty – then I believe that they are capable of eradicating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this 2015 framework should be overarching, and if a country puts in a lot of effort inside the country, we should recognise that effort. But it is not for us to put in small things here and there to address some particular aspects. It is not sufficient, and I believe the agenda should be broader.</p>
<p class="contents">To Ms Costello, on middle-income countries: we need criteria. We should be objective. Mr Goerens himself started this process – and I fully agree – when we discussed the very difficult banana-accompanying measures. It was then that we started to ask what the criteria are that we are addressing, and for the first time it was very clear that Parliament now has criteria. If I come to the middle-income countries with a fair attitude, I need to base myself on criteria. Is the GDP good enough or not? Well, this is under debate, but I think we are achieving a consistent approach.</p>
<p class="contents">On Ms Ojuland’s point, the EEAS and the Commission are working well together. I would really say that we have definitely a much better situation than Louis Michel had with his colleagues and others. We are very coherent in our approach. We are improving on it and they are working very much on strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Ferreira, commitments need to be fulfilled, and I think the most important commitment we have made is that of 0.7 % of GNI for development causes in 2015. I believe the push from this House is crucial, especially when we come now to the multiannual financial framework. The part which we have put in the EU budget is exactly that part of our commitment of 0.7 %. It is not different, it is part of it and it is a crucial part that should be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finish with Mr Kelly, on the Nobel Peace Prize. I think that this prize is very much justified. I am Latvian, and I think the EU has given us a lot of encouragement. If my country is in a situation of security, peace and relative prosperity, a lot of that is definitely due to the EU being there. It has made changes that would be impossible any other way. I believe the EU experience is definitely something that we need to promote in a lot of regions, and particularly in Africa where all the countries are rather small. Even South Africa, which is the biggest country of all, is actually small. So the only way Africa can evolve is by working together and for this the EU gives a good example and encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Brons I would say that we do not necessarily support countries. While we try to work through countries to strength things, we support people, and this should not be misunderstood. We know that the most sustainable way of addressing poverty is by supporting governments of countries with a credible strategy. But our support is always to the people of those countries, and sometimes we make this distinction. As regards differentiation of ACP countries, we have the Cotonou Agreement until 2020. We will be responsible towards that agreement. We have a dialogue, in particular, with ACP countries and we respond to requests from our ACP partner countries. We do not make unilateral moves that change the nature of the relationship. At the same time, we should also in this House encourage discussion on what should come after the Cotonou Agreement and on what comes after 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thank you, first of all, to the House for its verdict on the work we have done in committee. I know that not everything has been accepted unconditionally, notably the concept of differentiation – in every language of the Union and in every respect. Of course there are pockets of poverty in the emerging countries – big ones, even. There are also 112 million poor people in Europe. That is not a reason to ignore the poverty that exists in the emerging countries and in Europe. Let us stop ranking our own poor against the poor in other countries! Different instruments exist, depending on the country where these poor people live.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation policy must be neither saintly and perfect nor timid. It must be bold, coherent, selective and sustainable. This, in essence, is the conclusion I draw from the work we have just completed. I leave this debate with some questions, but also some reasons for satisfaction. The questions include that of whether or not we shall achieve 0.7 % of GNI by 2015. Times are hard. So we must not be complacent about the effort required of us. If we do not discharge our responsibilities for development, no one will do it for us.</p>
<p class="contents">And how can we inform our fellow citizens better? I see some cause for satisfaction here. It stems from the fact that, from the answers which Commissioner Piebalgs has given, it seems virtually certain that 2015 will be the European Year for (responsible) Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause for satisfaction, if this idea is carried through – and I do not doubt for a moment that it will be – is that we shall be able to announce in 2015 what we regard as the essentials of development cooperation policy and what the best partnerships should be. We still have a little time to bring our full weight to bear. The rest of the world may be advancing at an extraordinary pace, but Europe is still the foremost player.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my chief causes for satisfaction is the great expertise we possess. We should try to demonstrate this expertise to our fellow citizens and to the rest of the world. I have visited so many developing countries where Europe is by far the biggest aid donor but where perceptions of the European Union, as a player, are inversely proportional to the efforts and the funds we invest.</p>
<p class="contents">I think 2015 will be a good time to put an end to this misplaced modesty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its main objective is to reduce poverty. To achieve this objective, the support given to developing countries to improve access to education is essential, when over a hundred million children worldwide are not in education. Without an education, these children have no chance of achieving the professional training they need to be able to enter the labour market later, and, at the same time, efforts to combat poverty in these countries are made more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider the EU’s support essential so that as many children as possible, especially those living in rural areas, can take part in educational programmes – primary education and good quality training for work. Similarly, the EU should support the development of sectoral plans that also take into account the specific cultural factors of each region or country, with an emphasis on involving civil society in these countries as much as possible in implementing them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, in Africa, the trend is actually the reverse. A number of extremely serious mistakes have been made in development aid. We should be just as concerned by the fact that, according to an IMF study, more than 50 % of the public expenditure of 33 countries depends on international development aid as by the fact that the aid that is given – in Somalia for instance – is misused to finance war. It is equally worrying that development aid is being used to promote agricultural projects under which the local population is forcibly driven out, which further exacerbates hunger and poverty. The EU has promoted that development, for instance with its biofuel rules. It is just as unacceptable that, after giving them debt relief, China is now encouraging them to take on new debts in order to secure raw materials supplies. What is clear is that we need a number of changes and that more must be done to check the population explosion, as that would make a major contribution towards combating hunger and poverty. Nor is it acceptable for states to want development aid but not even be prepared to take back their own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is to be gradually reduced. At the same time, however, we should aim at cooperation directed specifically at the poorest regions in those countries. We need triangular cooperation: between the northern donor countries, the new emerging countries and the developing countries. The BRICS countries must take on more responsibility when they operate in the developing countries (e.g. China/Africa). The focus must always be on help for self-help, which can be achieved by, for instance, microcredits for SMEs. Granting development aid must also be tied to: (1) respect for human rights, especially the protection of religious or ethnic minorities, and respect for women’s and children’s rights, and (2) cooperation by the recipient countries in taking back illegal migrants! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title22"></a><a name="creitem22"></a>

<p class="contents">A system of national development factors mainly determines the level of European funds for less-developed regions and it is based on calculations of both the degree of development of regions and the Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Within negotiations for the next long-term financial framework for the next seven years a cut in these factors is proposed and we, the Members of the European Parliament, never had the opportunity to discuss the cut in these factors, though I think this belongs in the area of joint decision-making which exists in the framework of European cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, I am worried that the joint consequences of the proposed changes to these factors will have a disproportionate effect on regions within the European Union in different Member States. This may be felt especially in East Slovenia, which is less developed and may be affected by these changes, which in fact amount to a 40 % loss of cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In this time of crisis, I think that it is not particularly necessary to emphasise that, in order to implement solidarity and investment policy in the EU, it is simply impossible to allow something like that, and so I would like the Commission to reply to me in writing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than one million people demanding that Catalonia be the next EU Member State is exceptional. This is why the President of Catalonia, Artur Mas, has decided to initiate a political process calling for early Catalan elections next month. This process will enable Catalans to decide freely, peacefully and democratically if they want to become a new Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The will of the Catalans is to remain in the European project. We believe in Europe, and our objective is not to be an isolated country but to become a new partner in the construction of Europe. The example of the agreement on a Scottish referendum in 2014 is an enlightening one. I hope that in Catalonia a new era for European democracy is being opened.</p>

<p class="contents">The task facing this summit was an important one: to decide on financing for the biodiversity rescue plan 2010-2020 [<span class="italic">sic</span>: 2011-2020], adopted two years ago at Nagoya.

<p class="contents">After the disappointment of the Rio Summit, this comes as a relief. The European Union and the international community are still capable of imposing their will when it comes to the environment. But the critical state of biodiversity requires us to intensify our efforts and deliver on our commitments to preserve our natural world, here and now, in the budget, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. And soon we shall be debating measures against biopiracy and ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. I urge you to show a solid front and prove, once again, that the European Parliament seeks and feels a responsibility for biojustice at European and world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe budget discipline means respecting agreements with pensioners rather than abandoning state commitments in mid-stream. I believe budget discipline means respecting the contracts of working people rather than inventing extraordinary taxes or cuts in subsidies. Budget discipline means respecting commitments to health, education and culture rather than closing services or shutting down and cancelling projects in mid-stream. Discipline means sorting out the banks rather than robbing taxpayers to put money into the hands of speculators so that they can save their banks. This is the budget discipline I would like to see implemented in the European Union, instead of continued subservience to the markets. If an example were needed, the budget under discussion in Portugal on the orders of the Troika is the perfect one, since it goes against all the commitments any State must have towards its citizens of not breaching the agreements made behind closed doors which are ruining Europe and its Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One million people have called for Catalan independence from Spain. On 15 October, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, made a speech at the time of signing an agreement to allow a referendum for Scottish independence from London. In Veneto, my own region, over the past few weeks, thousands of people have signed a petition for a referendum on whether Veneto should have independence from Italy. Yesterday, hundreds and thousands of people in Veneto, Lombardy and across all the regions in Northern Italy signed a petition for more autonomy from Rome. And, in Flanders and the Basque Country, too, citizens are calling vigorously for autonomy and independence from the national States.</p>
<p class="contents">And what does our President, Martin Schulz, say to all this? He calls for a courageous commitment to give a clear rejection of all separatist tendencies. His Vice-President, Alejo Vidal-Quadras, even goes so far as to call for the use of force against Catalan citizens. These declarations are a matter of extreme seriousness, contrary to the principles of the democracy which we proclaim here and which we should defend.

In this Union, it seems unthinkable that there could be any cherry-picking or ranking with regard to compliance with and enforcement of the fundamental principles according to some sort of hierarchical scale. At the same time, it is also unthinkable that the legal practices and legal systems of the Member States could create or review legislation that is contrary to the fundamental rights of the Union. However, ladies and gentlemen, believe it or not, this is what the National Council of the Slovak Republic did on 20 September 2007, through Decision 1483/2007. This decision reinforced the Beneš Decrees, and rendered them inviolable and irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, however, it is particularly interesting to regard it as a Second World War document, since it was adopted not in 1945 but in 2007. Arguments that make reference to historical documents are unfounded and amateurish, since historical documents belong in archives and history books, not in the valid legal system in force. I do not know whether my colleagues understand that 13 of the Decrees demand implementation on the basis of racial segregation and discrimination, just like the Nuremberg Laws. Slovakia should therefore remove these rules from the statute books. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Stricter supervision of banking activities is indispensable to avoid repeated banking crises, and also to ensure adequate protection for depositors. Nevertheless, the procedure by which Member States will be able to participate in the single supervisory mechanism needs to be clarified, especially regarding the status of those countries outside the euro area. We cannot ignore the gap between the cross-border dimension of banking activities and the way they are supervised at national level. In Romania, approximately 80 % of banking capital comes from the euro zone. Not least, we must ask ourselves how we can ensure the integrity of the single market if we divide the banking union into participating countries and non-participating countries. I therefore ask for equal rights for all Member States under the new supervisory structure, including where voting rights are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within weeks, Finnish, Dutch and German finance ministers said ‘no’. Last week’s Summit reaffirmed the June agreement, but within hours Chancellor Merkel announced it would not apply retrospectively. There was total shock and utter disbelief in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years ago four million Irish citizens were overnight burdened down with socialised bank debt – the biggest bail-out in history. Yes, Irish banks were saved but so were French, German and British banks, and at the insistence of the ESM. The ESM which we voted for – the only EU citizens to do so – has been dangled in front of our noses only to be cruelly whipped away when it seemed as if it might be of some use to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Merkel said last night that Ireland was a unique case, and so it is, but legacy debt, bank debt, must be dealt with in a European context. We want to succeed, but if the tools we need and the solidarity we have earned are not available to us, then we need to reappraise, because to play our part in helping to save the euro and then see our own economy and social solidarity destroyed as a consequence is simply not an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, it will be a double celebration, since we will also be commemorating the 120th anniversary of the birth of József Mindszenty, the cardinal who was thrown into prison by both the fascist and communist dictatorships. The ideals from which Mindszenty drew strength – freedom, tradition, fellowship – were genuinely European ideas. These ideals have also been represented by the statesmen who worked in Western Europe at that time to lift a continent exhausted by war. De Gasperi, Schuman, Monnet and Adenauer believed in the same Christian Europe as did the Hungarian cardinal.</p>
<p class="contents">These ideals and this faith preserved the tortured priest’s strength of character and lifted Europe out of a situation that seemed hopeless.

The responsibilities of the political system as a whole are great, because it treated a neo-fascist party, where the party’s leader greets people with a Nazi salute, as if it were any other party. It is the government, however, that bears fundamental responsibility. When the Minister for Public Order does not punish police officers who allow a parliamentarian from the Golden Dawn party to release detainees at intervals, when the Minister for Home Affairs answers a parliamentary question from that party concerning the number of foreign children in crèches, while it is clear that nationality is not a criterion for registration there, then democracy is in danger.

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the current European measures for islands do not spring from unified planning, nor are they based on an integrated evaluation of the situation of island regions.

One step in this direction would relate to the adaptation of the energy mix.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paul Rübig, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can see that there is strong interest in the Chamber in small and medium-sized enterprises. I am always glad to see the economic dynamism of this sector recognised. In particular, we know that 85 % of new jobs in Europe are generated by firms that are no more than five years old. That has nothing to do with the age of the entrepreneurs but relates to the age of the enterprises. That is why it is very important for us to concern ourselves with the creation of new firms and also to place more emphasis on training and further training. You cannot become an entrepreneur overnight; it begins in kindergarten where you learn to be independent. A majority of the population in Europe wants to be independent and make its own decisions, which is why it is also important for us to realise that these forms of business angel spin-off offer a genuine opportunity for the future, especially for women, young people and migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial policy is concerned, above all, with enhancing competitiveness. Here, the Commission has come up with a good initiative. Unfortunately, we in Europe are not very successful with our industrial policy. We have seen a 10 % decline since 2008. I believe it would be important to strengthen the SME test in the Member States accordingly. The Economic and Social Committee could play an important role here at European level, to check that the SME test is being conducted properly. The social partners would be in a particularly good position in terms of making positive proposals on how to simplify the system. It would also be important to have a multilingual online portal so that, when they export to or import from other countries, firms will know what the rules and problems are there. This information could be clustered in various areas. So here too, in the export sector, small firms facing a big world have entirely new opportunities, especially with the internet, with the international payment systems, with the parcel service, which is actually exploding thanks to information and communications technology.</p>
<p class="contents">But there, too, it is important to begin with people. That is why I am particularly interested in the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme, and that programme also needs to be hugely expanded in the period up to 2020. We can see, especially in countries facing cohesion problems, that the programme is extremely well accepted. We are even in favour of it becoming an Erasmus Mundus project, i.e. a project that can be set up worldwide, so that young entrepreneurs can approach their suppliers, their customers, get to know new markets, new people, which will improve business activity accordingly. Here we should support the Enterprise Europe Network, because it already includes a lot of expertise and is an area that can be rolled out worldwide in order to lead to even greater successes.</p>
<p class="contents">But competitiveness also means that we need to put a stop to bureaucracy. We have to address the need to reduce the administrative burden. The objective would be – at least up to 2015 – to reduce the administrative burden by 25 %. Here, too, I could imagine that, as a start, the Committee of the Regions could make a wide range of proposals that the Commission could then take on board. It is also important to have competitive SME taxation and a plan for business transfers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we also need healthy and satisfied workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report, Mr Rübig, sends out the wrong signal to the Commission in that regard. It describes safety and health rules in the workplace as administrative burdens that must be subjected to the SME test. By definition, however, health and safety standards that are set as minimum standards at European level are not administrative burdens. You also say that Member States should not go in for what is called gold plating, i.e. must not be allowed to set higher health standards, and that the Commission should call for more harmonisation. Given, however, that the health and safety rules are all minimum standards, more far-reaching protection of the safety and health of workers is always permissible.

The Commission welcomes the support for its actions announced in the Communications on the internationalisation of SMEs, industrial policy and smart regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right. SMEs are the backbone of the economy. They represent around two thirds of all private sector jobs and generate around 58 % of the value added. They have also created 85 % of new jobs in recent years. However, they have been seriously affected by the crisis and need help to face new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can assure you that the European strategy for SMEs will focus on the promotion of SME-friendly activities across the full range of EU policies and spending programmes. This includes in particular the simplification of procedures and the creation of one-stop shops. But we will also provide dedicated support and services reflecting the particular needs of the SME community at European level through the Programme for the Competiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (the ‘COSME’ programme).</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Rübig calls for an internationalisation strategy for SMEs, and the Commission can only support this idea. Currently, only 13 % of SMEs export to countries outside the Union, and we all know where the future growth opportunities are: in the fast-growing economies in Asia, South America and Africa. The OECD has estimated that 90 % of world growth in 2012 is taking place outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently identifying the gaps in the support to businesses abroad. The result of this mapping exercise will be presented in December. Next year we will present concrete action at European level to address the difficulties that SMEs face on the ground. However, I can assure you that we will continue the current successful initiatives such as the partnering services of the Enterprise Europe Network, the China SME IPR Helpdesk and the established SME business centres in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would also like to mention the Missions for Growth of Vice-President Tajani. In 2012 missions have taken place to Brazil, the United States, Mexico and Colombia. These missions have been a real success, judging from the positive feedback and the conclusion of political agreements in a number of sectors such as SME policy and industrial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the reduction of the administrative burden, this is a concern for all of us. The Commission is strengthening the application of the SME test in our impact assessment procedure. But, as you know, SMEs still suffer from burdensome regulations. This is why the Commission is currently working in close cooperation with SMEs and SME organisations to identify the ‘top ten’ most burdensome pieces of legislation. An open public consultation is ongoing until Christmas. We have no time to lose, and the result of this consultation will allow us to go to the core of the problems. We will screen these problematic pieces of legislation and analyse where there is scope for introducing lighter regimes for SMEs while preserving the purpose of the legislation, such as health and security aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">But in addition, the future EU budget will also provide targeted financial support for SMEs. The COSME programme will cover actions in favour of the competitiveness of SMEs, such as improving access to finance and the Enterprise Europe Network. The COSME programme will also aim at improving the sustainability of EU businesses and improving access to markets within the EU and internationally – all priorities mentioned in your report, Mr Rübig.</p>
<p class="contents">COSME will also enhance the Erasmus for Entrepreneurs initiative specifically mentioned by Mr Rübig. Therefore, COSME is <span class="underline">the</span> programme to support the political priorities underlined by you. In these times of austerity, we also note the request in the report to significantly increase the budget of this important programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Commission President Barroso has on several occasions underlined that SMEs are one of the priorities of his mandate, and I can assure you that he is determined to put that into practice using all the EU instruments at his disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, SMEs are the sector of the economy that has been hit hardest by the economic crisis. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are struggling to survive. In my opinion, there are three areas that must be emphasised and which could, in my view, significantly improve the situation of SMEs in the Union market. The first area is facilitating access to financial instruments and reducing administrative burdens. These constitute the greatest burden for enterprises that have been hit by the crisis. We must proceed one step at a time in order to break down the barriers, so legislators must encourage the interests of SMEs to be taken into consideration right at the earliest stages of legislating. The second area is improving the attitudes of entrepreneurs. New businesses are a real alternative to unemployment and create an opportunity for unemployed young people to escape from the crisis. SMEs play an important role in appropriate training and education, which facilitate access to work. The third area is improving access to Union and global markets. Only a quarter of European SMEs are active within the single market outside their own country, and so it is particularly important to support the stimulation of both exports and imports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs play a very important role in improving the European Union’s economic situation and contributing to Member States’ gross domestic product. For that reason, all measures aimed at supporting, developing and promoting SMEs are of the utmost importance. It is vital to remove inefficient and inconsistent legal and administrative provisions relating to the development of SMEs, to concentrate on resolving their difficulties, to promote and evaluate the effectiveness of support programmes and to assist the creation of a platform for cooperation between businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nothing proves this better than the fact that SMEs account for a significant proportion of enterprises and employ 75 million people. Incentives and opportunities have to be found for them, so that we can help them to operate and increase their competitiveness. Above all, there must be movement towards improvements in the regulation of product markets and towards innovative sectors. The participation of SMEs in continuing with work aiming to modernise and interconnect energy networks is almost indispensable from the perspectives of sustainability and resource efficiency. Since the social economy employs more than 11 million people in the European Union, the creation of benefits and support for social enterprises is also important. I agree that improving the commercial environment may be one way of promoting economic growth. Aid originating from the Structural Funds and the Connecting Europe Facility must be used to improve infrastructure, including investment in reconstruction and modernisation. Member States should strive for a consistent reduction in the administrative burdens for enterprises. I also think that the creation of tax systems that are favourable to small enterprises and of forms of business finance that are effective and easy to access will be of crucial importance for enterprises and for the citizens employed by them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So jobs created by SMEs are much more stable than those in large companies. This means that supporting SMEs is part of the solution needed to achieve the objective of healthy growth. Opening up external markets to SMEs, and particularly increasing the extent to which they can take part in trade between Member States, would bring important benefits for all employees in these companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Small rural businesses are a special case. Given the need to diversify the rural economy, the new common agricultural policy needs to allocate adequate funds to finance and develop these businesses. Rural SMEs can absorb a significant part of the excess workforce from agriculture, and, at the same time, they can offer rural workers the services they need. Not least, hundreds of successful businesses have started up in rural areas, by exploiting opportunities offered by rural development programmes. This is a further argument in support of an adequate budget for agriculture, as part of the future multiannual financial framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title24"></a><a name="creitem24"></a>

It was in December 2010 that we adopted the Annual Report on Human Rights, which called for justice for this courageous Russian lawyer, who died fighting corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Although former president Dmitry Medvedev promised to cast light on this case, we still have not seen justice served. Last week the court hearing in Moscow again showed too little progress – of the 60 individuals implicated in his death, just two prison doctors have been charged with negligence.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly three years have passed since the tragic death of Sergei Magnitsky in custody, after torture and non-provision of medical assistance. His horrific treatment and torture resembles the case of another young lawyer, Vasily Alexanyan, who was legal counsellor to Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Yukos and who died after unlawful imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of facing justice, these people are still in office. They are travelling in the EU, they spend their dirty money in the EU, they buy real estate in the EU and they educate their children here.</p>
<p class="contents">This recommendation suggests that the EU Member States should stop these practices. Visa bans and asset freezes are concrete reactions to such behaviour and demonstrate the EU’s value-based policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, Putin’s regime has turned its back on liberal democratic values and the rule of law. Corruption has become a byword for governance in Russia. The Transparency International index shows Russia, together with Nigeria, to be at the bottom of the list. It is therefore especially arrogant of Putin to ask for visa liberalisation for the holders of the so-called ‘blue passports’ that are used by the representatives of the state administration. Does he really believe that the EU should welcome the masters of corruption?</p>
<p class="contents">Just two weeks ago, the monitoring report on Russia’s commitments was debated next door, at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Instead of showing goodwill and cooperation and respecting the rules of the Council of Europe, Russia’s representatives criticised the organisation for its so-called interference in Russian domestic issues. We also witnessed Russia’s threats to stop its financing of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only cooperation between the EU and Russia that is being challenged; the Russia-NATO dialogue is being similarly affected. Russia’s attitude to its membership of the WTO demonstrates once again that the common rules of the club do not matter. Russia simply takes the WTO ‘à la carte’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. The Magnitsky case is more than the tragedy of an individual fighting organised crime. His personal fate reflects the complexity of the transition that Russian society is going through. The degradation of political and institutional life has translated into epic corruption on the one hand and the reanimation of civil society, claiming its constitutional rights, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As Russia stands at the crossroads, with civil society struggling for the rule of law, we cannot let EU banks accept the fortunes of corrupt individuals, stealing from the Russian people. Standing, as we do, for the universality of human rights, and issuing resolutions in favour of democracy and the rule of law in Russia, we are obliged to live up to our declarations.</p>

Mr Mikolášik is absolutely right that it is our duty today, as Ms Ojuland also pointed out, to stand up for this ordinary man, this ordinary Russian, who did not want to steal, who did not want any part in the activity that is possibly Russia’s most profitable industry right now, namely corruption. It is our duty to do this very minimum, to do what Ms Ojuland’s report proposes, which is to introduce a visa ban and freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement in the killing of this innocent man, a man who, in a situation of wrongdoing, of the type we have seen in Russia, tried to do the right thing. That is our duty, our obligation. If we take seriously what we refer to as European values, if we take ourselves seriously, we should do everything we can to prevent the recurrence of what has happened and to speak out about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I grew up in a town in which a Russian garrison was stationed. As a result, I met many ordinary Russians – very decent people. As an MEP, I have had the opportunity to meet Russian opposition leaders, but also people who may not be in the front line, but who are involved in helping to create a European, more democratic Russia. I would like to say one thing on their behalf: it is outrageous that a country situated in Europe, that wishes to be a European state and to be treated as an equal, as we treat each other in the European Union, should allow such practices. Firstly, the corruption that exists within the authorities and the judiciary, and, secondly, the methods of destroying people who, as Mr Migalski said, wish to behave honestly, to pursue truth and fairness.

The European Parliament’s recommendation to the Council on establishing common visa restrictions for Russian officials involved in the Sergei Magnitsky case is a significant initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been vocal and consistent about this case in recent years, from the European Parliament resolution of 16 December 2010 to a number of hearings and debates and the recommendation the House will vote on tomorrow. All these initiatives testify to the great importance the European Parliament and the European public at large attach to the Magnitsky case. These initiatives lend much weight to our common efforts to prompt the authorities in Moscow to investigate the case swiftly and thoroughly. They give further legitimacy to the EU’s continuous pressure on the Russian Federation to bring the Magnitsky case to a thorough conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the Vice-President/High Representative has consistently called on Russia to ensure a proper investigation. We are raising this with the Russian authorities at all levels. Indeed, the Magnitsky case is consistently part of the agenda for our twice-yearly human rights consultations. Moreover, it is regularly brought up at ministerial level as well as at our summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, Vice-President/High Representative Ashton addressed the Magnitsky case in this House. During the debate on the political use of justice she noted with great concern that the continuous lack of progress on the Magnitsky case was part of a general trend of worrisome legislative and judicial developments in activities in the Russian Federation. This trend is of serious concern to the European Union. The speech and the debate that followed were reported by the Russian press.</p>
<p class="contents">In April of this year, President Van Rompuy, in a very significant political gesture, wrote a letter to the then President, Medvedev, specifically on the Magnitsky case. President Van Rompuy made three important points in this letter. First, he urged the Russian Government to bring the case to a comprehensive conclusion. Second, he called on Russia to close the posthumous prosecution of Mr Magnitsky. Third, he called for an end to the intimidation of Mr Magnitsky’s mother and widow.</p>
<p class="contents">The European External Action Service keeps reminding the Russian side that a response to the letter remains outstanding. All these points, as well as the outstanding response to President Van Rompuy’s letter, were also reiterated most recently by Commissioner Malmström at the Permanent Partnership Council on Freedom, Security and Justice which took place on 2 October in Nicosia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken this matter very seriously and will continue to do so, for three very good reasons. First, because of the nature of the case itself. It is a case of a Russian citizen and a lawyer, a young father being arrested and mistreated by law enforcement officers for standing up against suspected fraud and abuse by government officials. As such it is a case of grave abuse of the law and of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is founded on the core values of human dignity, freedom, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and we are committed to defending these. The Magnitsky case has become one of the emblematic cases in this respect, not only for the Russian people but also for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why we continue to be active in the Magnitsky case is that we believe that Russia itself should have a great interest in solving it. The case has come to symbolise the state of the judiciary and the rule of law in the Russian Federation. Business people consider this a litmus test for the stability, predictability and safety of Russia as a destination for investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly as this is a multifaceted case with a strong undercurrent of corruption, anti-corruption efforts are being woven into Russia’s modernisation efforts, on which we are working together with them. Solving this case would send a strong signal to partners and investors that Russia is serious in its anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is in the interest of the EU to have at its borders a stable, democratic, economically-viable Russia with a well-grounded rule of law. Steps like Russia’s recent accession to the WTO are important in integrating Russia into global rules-based systems. This is a step in the right direction to gaining global confidence in this marketplace. Cases such as Magnitsky’s, unfortunately, do exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed now is concrete action on the part of the Russian Government: a clear decision to properly and thoroughly investigate the Magnitsky case, bringing those responsible to justice. As has been said, we take very careful note of the recommendation Parliament addressed to the Council on restrictive measures on Russian officials involved in the Sergei Magnitsky case. It sends a clear and strong message. Acting on this recommendation would require unanimity from all the Member States. As those responsible for the overall relationship between the European Union and Russia, we must carefully balance our actions towards our neighbour. Restrictive measures by the EU are a very sensitive instrument. Such measures should only be considered in very specific situations and in accordance with existing EU guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, restrictive measures should be used as part of an integrated and comprehensive policy approach involving political dialogue, complementary efforts and other instruments. Let me assure you that the Magnitsky case will remain on the bilateral agenda in our contacts with Russia. Sanctions should be used only as a last resort, otherwise we risk them becoming the only instrument in many of our relationships whenever such crimes are committed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me reiterate once again, on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, that we will continue to pursue the Magnitsky case with the Russian Federation at every opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I object to all forms of restrictions on the freedom of speech and the right of free expression, and to any human rights violations. Despite this, I am abstaining from the vote because many similar cases are being covered up in Europe. Everything that has been said on the Magnitsky case – abuse of power, lawsuits to remove political and economic rivals, arrests, torture, impunity of human rights abusers – applies to the current situation in Bulgaria. Despite numerous reports on my part, the European institutions remain silent, and no such measures or proposals have been made to the Council. I do not believe it is right for Europe to judge Russia while turning a blind eye when Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov misuses his power, particularly since such silence and lack of action give him that sense of ‘impunity’ which is being criticised so strongly in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title25"></a><a name="creitem25"></a>

Even if only for the record, however, please allow me to present my report on trade and economic relations with the United States. This report was approved by a large majority in the Committee on International Trade. As that committee’s standing rapporteur for trade and economic relations with the United States, I am personally very satisfied with its content, firstly because it sends a strong message of support for the development of trade and economic relations between the EU and the United States, and secondly because it expresses the Union’s most important offensive and defensive approaches without setting preconditions for opening negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, above all, a political report. It is a sign of Parliament’s backing for the anticipated opening of negotiations on the trade and investment agreement between the EU and the United States with a view to creating a true transatlantic market. The report seeks to answer two crucial questions. Question one: does a trade and investment treaty between the EU and the United States make sense? It is broadly acknowledged that it does. Firstly, all the studies and analyses highlight the enormous growth potential that reciprocal liberalisation of trade and investment would bring for both parties. Secondly, both economies are facing common challenges that can only be properly addressed jointly rather than separately. These include low growth, the dramatic progress of the new emerging economies, particularly China, and the increasing protectionism in some important economies such as Argentina, Brazil, Russia and South Africa. Thirdly, with the failure of the Doha Round concerning a multilateral treaty on the global opening up of trade, the only way forward is a bilateral approach. Question two: will the United States and the European Union be able to reach agreement within a reasonable timeframe? We will begin by saying right now that this will not be an easy task. There are significant differences in interests in certain important areas, particularly agriculture and air and maritime transport, to cite two examples. There are substantial regulatory differences in technical standards concerning motor vehicles, for example. There are entrenched cultural differences, such as the cautious European perspective on food and environmental safety, on the one hand, and the risk-based US perspective on the other. There are several irritating elements, such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and meat from descendants of cloned animals, to quote just two examples again. Although considerable, such difficulties are not insurmountable, let alone likely to prevent a successful agreement. Firstly, there must be an agreement, in particular provided it covers all sectors and removes most of the barriers to trade and investment; secondly, the potential advantages of such an agreement are so great that it is worth making the necessary mutual concessions so as to harvest the fruits of substantial liberalisation of trade and investment between the two parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon Parliament to support my report so that Parliament’s voice can be heard from the outset and taken into account in Commission and Council initiatives in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, it is similar for genetically modified organisms – another sensitive question for us in Europe. However, this can be handled through careful negotiations.

<p class="contents">We all agree on the importance of EU-US trade relations. Almost EUR 2 billion of goods and services are traded every day between the European Union and the United States. Investment stocks are at over EUR 2 trillion, and almost half the world’s gross domestic product and one third of world trade is generated by the two sides of the Atlantic, taken together. These numbers illustrate that the EU-US trade and investment relationship is second to none.</p>
<p class="contents">However, more can be done. At a time of economic hardship, enhanced trade makes an important contribution to growth and jobs. This is why we are committed to making the current flagship trade and investment undertaking a success. At the November 2011 summit meeting, US and EU leaders established the high-level working group on jobs and growth, tasking it with identifying ways to increase trade in investment to support mutually beneficial job creation, economic growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 June, we adopted an interim report in which we reached the preliminary conclusion that a comprehensive agreement addressing a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues would provide the most significant benefits from the various options considered. It is also the best option from a political point of view, and it allows for a package deal.</p>
<p class="contents">No political decision to launch negotiations has yet been reached. The process started at the last EU-US summit has clearly moved in that direction. We are working hard with our US colleagues with a view to drafting the requested final report before the end of the year. The final report is supposed to make a recommendation on the way forward, which we think should be the launch of comprehensive negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report is very timely indeed. It constitutes a balanced and constructive contribution to the work of the high-level working group. We will take into account the views and positions expressed therein to the greatest possible extent. May I thank the honourable Members again for their valuable contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the publication of the ‘time to deliver’ report by the European Commission, I set out to address many of the points raised in my own-initiative report, which was overwhelmingly supported by my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism in July.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Single European Sky has suffered from many past constraints and there are clearly still many challenges which lie ahead. European air traffic continues to increase, which is good news for growth, but there remain serious capacity issues in most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be greater urgency in order to avoid possible safety and operational risks resulting from ever-greater traffic flows and outdated technologies. The benefits of full and timely implementation of the Single European Sky are clear and cannot be ignored. A study by the SESAR joint undertaking has shown that it will create more than 300 000 jobs, save in the region of 50 million tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span> and ultimately make air traffic more efficient, reducing the cost to the consumer and competing more effectively with our global competitors in order to maintain our market share. This is just good business.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear for these reasons alone that making European air space as efficient as possible is important for job creation, the environment and – at a time when many European countries are verging on or are in recession – economic benefits. These positive effects will be seen across all the Member States and will extend to the entire supply chain, including manufacturers, airlines and SMEs, and into sectors such as tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the jobs created through this project will be both highly skilled and highly paid. SESAR technologies would allow air traffic controllers to become a more mobile workforce in a modernised, automated industry and be able to sell their talents widely, contributing to a more flowing, robust and innovative sector – in short, a sector fit for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key challenges is the defragmentation of European air space. The move to create functional air space blocks is painfully slow and, quite frankly, unacceptable. A strong message needs to be sent to the Member States. They are the same Member States that signed up to this project more than ten years ago, when we first dealt with this legislation and, in addition, countries that have joined the EU in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe are world leaders in developing technology, and we need to make sure that it is our companies which benefit. It is vitally important that we cooperate closely with neighbouring countries and the military to ensure that the systems we develop are interoperable worldwide. The financial investment in R&amp;D for the Single European Sky has been substantial, and it is now time to put in place the measures necessary to reap the benefits of that investment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that I am sick and tired of listening to problems – meaning that we cannot do something – when in fact we are prepared to find the solutions. We are also competing with emerging markets in Asia, South America and the Middle East. Either we rise to that challenge or we will suffer the consequences. Member States need to stop procrastinating and get on with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has the support of this Parliament to enforce sanctions on Member States who do not comply. I should like to send a strong message to Commissioner Kallas, who is not here tonight, that he has my full support and that we wish him to go full throttle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needed, and did not have, the flexibility of a common airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">Two and a half years later, we are in a political impasse in which the immediate completion of the Single European Sky seems more of a fantasy, while the official establishment of the functional airspace blocks (FABs) is still delayed. In any case, this does not guarantee, by itself, an improvement in aviation performance.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed at the moment is the political will to cut through the red tape and overcome inertia, to eliminate national self-interest. In doing this, particularly now, we ought not to neglect the significance of symbolism. The Single European Sky is a technical project with known benefits – which have already been discussed – but, at the same time, it is also a symbol of European integration and it would be a good idea for us to remember that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather than developing the sector according to a rationale of prioritising the general interest, the underlying vision is to bring airspace management into line with the interests of the major airlines and the monopolistic concentration under way in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments set out over the years in favour of the Single European Sky are secondary to this objective and are unfounded, whether with respect to safety, with respect to employment or with respect to environmental issues. All these matters can best be considered in the context of the public ownership and management of the sector rather than in the context of the liberalisation it is hoped to promote at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget the steps that have already been taken and those still to come in seeking greater coordination and better use of airspace while maintaining each Member State’s sovereignty over their national airspace, an essential issue in defending each country’s specific interests, whether in connection with commercial aviation or defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not forget that this restructuring and the new programme will have an impact on European Union GDP in the order of EUR 419 billion, could create 328 000 new jobs and, of no less importance, lead to 50 million tonnes fewer of carbon-dioxide emissions.

I therefore welcome the report and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Foster, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Single European Sky has been the subject of frequent debates in this House and also, more recently, at the High-Level Conference in Limassol. The main undisputed conclusion of this debate is that progress on the initiative is slow and the expected benefits are yet to fully materialise. We still lack an integrated approach, and the fragmented governance structure based on national borders prevails. These inefficiencies add an extra EUR 5 billion annually in costs for air navigation services.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, above all, a problem of timing. There is an urgent need to act quickly and push ahead with the implementation. One of the reasons for this situation seems to be the lack of political willingness from Member States. The Commission has recently written to transport ministers, reminding them of their obligations and urging prompt and proactive decisions. The Commission will increase its efforts to ensure timely and full implementation. If need be, the Commission will take legal action against Member States that do not comply.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, though many positive steps have already been taken, we need to move beyond compliance and towards actual delivery of results. I agree with you that the performance pillar needs to be further promoted and concrete operational gains should shortly materialise as a result of the implementation of the functional airspace blocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently evaluating measures to accelerate the implementation of the Single European Sky and the SESAR programme with a view to unleashing the beneficial effects of the Single European Sky. The Commission agrees to report back to the Parliament in 2013 on the progress made with regard to the implementation of the Single European Sky, as well as on its strategy for a more decisive process of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying principles of the existing legislation remain valid. We do not have to return to the drawing board and should now make some changes in order to gain speed and ensure delivery. We need to simplify and clarify the legislation. I can inform you that we are already working on new proposals to accelerate implementation of the Single Sky, complement some initiatives which are not yet complete and strengthen the existing legislation. The Commission’s intention is to deliver these proposals in spring 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The desire to ensure an efficient aviation sector has become such a key issue that, for some time now, we have been focusing on air traffic capacity, without emphasising the importance of the airspace itself. I agree with the rapporteur and believe that the Member States have committed themselves to implementing a Single European Sky. Consequently, they should also show commitment now to introducing the relevant legislation. It is natural that there should be concerns and risks associated with the transformation of air traffic management. However, highly qualified and adequately rewarded staff will ensure the cohesion of the system. One of the biggest challenges facing us is how to stop the fragmentation of European airspace; appropriate airspace blocks should replace Member States’ fragmented approach, thereby improving efficiency and reducing air traffic congestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, knowing the situation, I am unsure whether it is appropriate to penalise states which do not fulfil their commitments by the cut-off date of December 2012. The introduction of functional airspace blocks is a highly ambitious objective which has implications for national sovereignty and requires the interaction of air traffic control systems that are structured differently and operate differently, so it takes time to ensure a smooth and safe transition.

<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I welcome the Commission’s objective of adapting EU law and improving its application to all transport modes, strengthening its enforcement by national enforcement authorities and providing passengers with better information about their rights. At the moment, it is not possible to have a common regulation applicable to all transport modes because of the lack of experience in relation to waterborne and bus and coach transport. In my view, it is, however, worth striving for this, especially in order to promote intermodal transport and prevent unfair competition in tourist transport.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, I call in my report for a common core of rights applicable to all transport modes, without forgetting the special features of particular transport modes. We must ensure a certain level of flexibility and proportionality depending on the transport mode. I call on the Commission, in this respect, to start work now on guidelines that also ensure that the existing rights – freedom from discrimination, right to the fulfilment of carriage contracts, accurate, complete and generally accessible information, immediate and adequate assistance in the event of problems – are not watered down.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I want briefly to address a few main points of the report. Let me say, in regard to information and transparency, that information on these rights must be simple, clear and accessible. Furthermore, I call for greater assistance to passengers by trained staff at information points and help desks. In regard to fares, I believe that we must establish clear rules that prevent any unfair commercial practice. In regard to the application and implementation of rights, the national enforcement authorities have a central role to play. That is why I believe we need a European data bank and networking at European level to make their work more efficient. Here, it is essential to set up a central, electronic complaint centre, a clearing house.</p>
<p class="contents">There are major problems in relation to the question of liability and the term ‘extraordinary circumstances’. In this regard, we should use the judgments of the European Court of Justice as a reference point and ensure that the rules are worded in plain language. A very important point is the special needs of people with disabilities or reduced mobility. We must, as I said, pay special attention to them, including in intermodal travel. Owing not least to the economic crisis, we have seen a rising number of airlines go out of business. Here, we call on the Commission finally to propose practical solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to point to the increase in intermodal transport. I believe, as I said, that a common core of rights applying to all transport modes and a standard way of proceeding for carriers and enforcement bodies as a whole are the sine qua non that has to be brought about if intermodal travel is to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and colleagues for their input. They have supported me with their ideas and helped give substance to the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report makes positive recommendations on matters such as passenger information and the rights of people with disabilities or reduced mobility, among others. It is difficult to understand, however, why the expression ‘public services’ does not appear a single time in the report’s 15 pages.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and most important right of passengers and of the population is the right to a high-quality, modern, efficient and functional public service at accessible prices. This debate therefore cannot disregard the process under way involving the destruction of the public transport service in countries such as my own, Portugal. This destruction is driven by the European Union and the IMF, and involves the withdrawal of services, soaring prices, a decline in quality, loss of workers’ rights and dismissals, all in preparation for a privatisation that will inevitably bring about an even greater deterioration in the service provided. Passenger rights cannot be discussed without reference to all these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A constructive debate has taken place since the Commission presented its vision for a more coherent and effective implementation of EU passenger rights across all modes of transport in its communication at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make the following specific comments on the report: the Commission shares the objective of consolidating the current framework into a single cross-modal regulation, but in the medium term. The regulations on passengers’ rights in the field of coach and maritime transport have yet to come into force. There remain major differences between transport modes, and the convergence of passengers’ rights will inevitably be a gradual process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the creation of an EU-wide complaint form for each transport mode. A complaint form already exists for aviation. The Commission intends to develop forms for the other modes, taking into account their specificities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also conscious of the impact that airline bankruptcy has on flight-only passengers. The recent failures of Spanair and Malev were collectively well managed, thanks to a proactive approach based on providing information and promoting other carriers’ cheap rescue fares. This proves that the current legislation makes adequate provision for dealing with bankruptcies. However, solutions are needed to ensure passengers are not left stranded and are quickly reimbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore intends to come up, in late 2012, with these new solutions – which are not necessarily of a legislative nature – in order to ensure implementation that is as swift as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of price transparency in aviation is addressed in several pieces of legislation, most notably the Air Services Regulation. I would like to inform the honourable Members that this legislation is currently undergoing a fitness check to establish whether it is adequate for its original purpose and if it should be revised. The Commission will inform Parliament of the results in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">The work done by Parliament in the area of passenger rights is providing valuable guidance to the Commission, especially in view of the forthcoming revision of the Regulation on air passenger rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is owed special thanks for supporting my 19 motions for amendments, all of which aim to make life easier for disabled European citizens. Among other things, I have spoken in favour of equality of treatment, which must also be enforced in the case of transport for disabled people, in favour of removing physical barriers on modes of transport and at railway stations in addition to barriers to information and its communication, and in favour of consideration being given to design-for-all requirements. I consider it important that sign-language services employing video technology are also gaining ground in the area of transport, as well as text-based services that ensure inclusion of the deaf and hard-of-hearing as well as users with speech impediments. At the same time, it is essential that a unified protocol be drawn up in relation to staff training for those employed by the various transport sectors and in relation to safety rules. The latter is particularly true in the case of air-transport rules, where some airlines decide arbitrarily how many deaf or wheelchair passengers may travel in their aircraft. It is essential because this causes enormous financial and ethical damage. I therefore think that, even though the legislation on the rights of bus and boat passengers has not yet entered into force, it is essential that horizontal legislation, extending to all modes of transport, starts to be created in the areas of compensation, reimbursement, transport for disabled passengers, and information flows. One of the pledges for the future of Europe is the barrier-free, unrestricted right to move from one place to another, but this is inconceivable without the Passenger Rights Regulation! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pricing must be transparent, hidden costs must not be accepted; the means of dispute resolution must be expedient and effective; there must always be clear, rapid contact points to resolve problems that arise during a journey; in the event of a problem when travelling using more than one mode of transport (for example by train and air), liability must be clear, etc. It is also important to ensure that the passenger rights of persons with reduced mobility travelling using various modes are harmonised and that consideration is given to the challenges posed by travelling. The next step in passenger legislation must be to move towards a clear regulation under which basic passenger rights are clearly enshrined in law throughout the territory of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Memorably, the most recent were bus passengers’ rights. Unfortunately, the adopted regulations have not yet come into force in respect of waterborne and bus and coach transport. In view of the continuing growth in the transport sector and the ever increasing number of passengers, equivalent appropriate passenger rights must be guaranteed for all transport modes. This is even more important given that, in many instances, travelling involves not just one but several different transport modes. For that reason, it is important for the simplest possible ticket booking and travel arrangement to be guaranteed so that passenger rights are protected throughout the journey. I had expected the report to incorporate the demand for passenger rights in different transport modes to be contained in a single regulation. The single most important aspect of passenger rights in different transport modes is that it is prohibited to discriminate on grounds of the location or nationality of the consumer or the travel agency. I am also of the view that, where passenger rights are concerned, it is important for full consideration to be given to the rights of the elderly, persons with disabilities or with reduced mobility. Harmonised Europe-wide passenger rights must be available to all. In view of the above, it is my view that this own-initiative report is necessary in order to provide the Commission with clear signals as to the direction that passenger rights must take in order to achieve genuine free movement of persons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particular attention is paid to the needs of persons with reduced mobility who may, at times, be forced to pay in cases where there are inadequate facilities, and to the development of intermodal transport. I am also pleased by the inclusion of the request that the Commission should address the proliferation of unfair clauses in air carrier contracts, such as the unfair requirement that passengers must use both parts of a return air ticket in order. When the rights of passengers using coach/bus transport, dating from 2011 and not yet entered into force, are adopted, the European Union will have an integrated set of fundamental passenger rights in all transport modes. Even though the Commission takes the view that it is too soon, at this stage, to provide a single regulation covering passengers in all transport modes, I hope that Parliament’s requests will be heard by the Commission, since unfortunately we still see cases in which the rights of European travellers are inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title28"></a><a name="creitem28"></a>
