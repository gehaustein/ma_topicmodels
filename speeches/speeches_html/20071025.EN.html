I also wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, and the Committee on Petitions, for their excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">My report records progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and providing knowledge about the Ombudsman’s role. I received 3 830 complaints in 2006. That means that the total number of complaints has stabilised at around the level reached following the 53% increase in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to inform you that the proportion of complaints falling within the mandate has gone up. This suggests that citizens are beginning to have a better knowledge both of my mandate and of that of my national and regional colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen, which is thus commensurately strengthened to the benefit of all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The total number of inquiries dealt with in 2006 was 586. Of these, 66% concerned the Commission. Given that the Commission is the EU institution with which citizens have most reason to have material contact, it is normal that it should be the principal target of inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2006, 250 decisions closing inquiries were made. In 95 cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration. Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institution concerned. Even when maladministration is not found, I may identify opportunities to improve the quality of administration provided by the institutions. If so, I point them out in a further remark.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of my inquiries result in a win-win outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution complained against. During 2006, 64 cases were settled by the institution concerned to the satisfaction of the complainant.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever I find maladministration, I try to achieve a friendly solution, if possible. Three friendly solutions were achieved in 2006 and a further 27 proposals for such a solution were under consideration by the institution concerned at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark, or make a draft recommendation. A critical remark is appropriate if it is no longer possible for the institution concerned to eliminate the instance of maladministration. I wish to emphasise that the criticism is intended to be constructive, so as to help avoid similar maladministration in the future. In 2006, I closed 41 inquiries in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">To better monitor the impact of my criticism and advice, I have this year launched a study of the follow-up to all critical remarks made in 2006, as well as to the 38 cases involving a further remark made during the same year. The results of these studies should provide further encouragement to the institutions concerned to improve their practices and develop a culture of service to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where it is still possible to eliminate the instance of maladministration, I normally make a draft recommendation to the institution, which must respond with a detailed opinion. During 2006, 13 draft recommendations were made.</p>
<p class="contents">If an institution fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, I may send a special report to the European Parliament. Two special reports were made in 2006. The first concerned the Council’s responsibility for the choice of languages used in its Presidency websites. The second called on the Commission to deal properly with an infringement complaint concerning sports betting services. I am pleased to report that the Commission reacted promptly and positively to that report.</p>
<p class="contents">A new feature of the Annual Report which I wish to highlight, with an eye to supporting and encouraging good administration, concerns what I call ‘star cases’ of good practice by institutions, revealed through my inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention some other activities that I have undertaken during 2006 with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Our agreement aims to ensure the consistent treatment of complaints that raise issues of data protection and to avoid unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement allows me to benefit from the expertise of the EDPS by consulting him in cases where the text of the Data Protection Regulation and existing case-law leave room for divergent views. This has already proved to be a useful mechanism for me when dealing with cases in which it is necessary to reconcile the legal right of access to documents with the right to privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also signed an agreement with the Spanish Government to enable citizens to complain to the European Ombudsman in any of the co-official languages in Spain. I thus aligned my practice with the conclusions reached in June 2005 by the Council, which provide for the use of those languages to facilitate Spanish citizens’ communication with the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I am grateful for the support for the work of the European Ombudsman expressed in Ms Sbarbati’s report, and I would like to inform Parliament that, as requested in her report, I am already engaged in preparing the ground for a memorandum of understanding with the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the implementation of EU law is largely the responsibility of Member States’ administrations, I will continue to develop cooperation through the European network of ombudsmen. I am happy to inform you that the sixth meeting of the network took place last week in this very building. At the conclusion of that successful meeting, we adopted by consensus a statement that aims to make the EU dimension of the work of national and regional ombudsmen better known, and to clarify the service they provide to people who complain about matters that fall within the scope of EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">The voluntary cooperation among ombudsmen that is now crystallised in the statement can, I believe, make an important and growing contribution to the European Union’s ability to deliver concrete results, by ensuring that citizens can enjoy their rights as an everyday reality and that problems are solved in ways that are close to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman was established to help bring the Union closer to citizens and to give the EU administration a ‘human face’. A fundamental aspect of our institution is that the Ombudsman is an individual who communicates personally with citizens, who reviews their cases, and who seeks to resolve their problems and complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Each one of these ‘microcommunications’ constitutes an opportunity to build trust between citizens and the institutions. In pursuit of this goal, I will continue to promote a constructive dialogue with the institutions and to draw their attention to problems so that they can improve their performance.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which a public administration reacts to complaints is a key measure of how citizen-focused it is. While progress has been made in many areas, the year 2006 regrettably saw a rise in the proportion of cases which I had to close with a critical remark.</p>
<p class="contents">That should be cause for concern for anyone who wants better relations between the EU and its citizens. Complaints offer an opportunity to put things right and to demonstrate that the institution concerned is serious about respecting the citizens’ fundamental right to good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure that citizens can easily reconcile the statements often made by institutions concerning their desire to get ‘closer to the citizen’, and for ‘more openness’, with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations and increase transparency. I am positively encouraged, however, by a number of indications that, during the present year, 2007, there is a much greater willingness to take up the opportunities offered by my inquiries to resolve complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Such cooperation is essential, because the Ombudsman cannot succeed alone. Ensuring a top-class administration is a task that must be tackled in tandem with the EU institutions. Delivering on promises, providing proper redress mechanisms, learning from mistakes, working openly and allowing for public scrutiny – these are the all-important ‘means’ towards building trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the European Ombudsman must work concertedly and systematically with national and regional colleagues to ensure that citizens’ rights are fully respected throughout the Union. Finally, the Ombudsman must continue to reach out to citizens so that they can become aware of his services.</p>
<p class="contents">With Parliament’s support and guidance, I will continue to endeavour to build on existing achievements with a view to truly fulfilling my institutional mandate of bringing the Union closer to citizens and giving the EU administration a ‘human face’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luciana Sbarbati  (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. – </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to thank the Ombudsman for his excellent work as is borne out by this particular report. I should also like to thank the Legal Services of the Commission and all my parliamentary colleagues on the committee, especially the shadow rapporteur and Mr Mavrommatis, for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The culture of service to the citizen, which is primarily designed to ensure high-quality, transparent, approachable, swift and cooperative public administration, has been encouraged and strengthened at Community level by the combined efforts of the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman, and its first emergence can be traced back to the resolution of 6 September 2001, the date on which the European Parliament adopted the code of good administrative conduct proposed by the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Treaty of Maastricht produced a qualitative leap in European citizenship by offering all citizens the possibility of submitting petitions to a parliamentary body, which remains the sole arbitrator, or applying to a more specialised body which, while operating on an extrajudicial basis, follows a procedure which does not rule out parliamentary intervention in the event of the Community institution responsible for the instance of maladministration proving reluctant to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not talk about the statistics, as the Ombudsman has already talked about them and they are set out in the report. Cases of maladministration currently relate to lack of transparency, refusal of information, abuse of power, legal error and failure to ensure fulfilment of Treaty obligations, in particular by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s decisions are not legally binding, but the safeguards that his work offers help to strengthen his powers of persuasion. He enjoys the active support of the Committee on Petitions, whose meetings he attended on four occasions in 2006, and cooperates with the network of European Ombudsmen, which should be improved and extended. Italy, for instance, does not as yet have a national Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be nevertheless be stressed that decisions with final effect should be reciprocally notified in real time in order to avoid conflicts of competence between the activities of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report divides the decisions taken on completed inquiries in 2006 into various categories: lack of openness on the part of Community institutions and bodies (25% of inquiries), the role of the Commission as the guarantor of the Treaty in relation to procedures under Article 226, the management of contracts, remuneration and grants, and the recruitment and management of the staff of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Procedures often end at the stage of critical remarks, which are a means of attempting to prevent the recurrence of cases of maladministration in future, in cases where it would be pointless to issue a recommendation. Various examples have been given by the Ombudsman, and can be read at leisure in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, the Committee on Petitions invites the Ombudsman to carry out a detailed study of the practical impact of critical remarks made during inquiries in 2006. The fact that institutions have a code of good administrative conduct is often not enough to guarantee the creation of a genuine culture of service.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also shows that there are still some grey areas in relation to the Commission making wrong use of its discretionary powers by failing to take prompt action before legal proceedings were begun, using political considerations as a pretext. With regard to contracts and staff management, some of the investigations launched by the Ombudsman on his own initiative show how his powers provide an effective means of goading the administrative authorities into self-regulation, a sound principle that needs to be put to increasing use.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the Committee on Petitions, however, the lack of synchronicity in timing and views with regard to the handling of the same case by the Ombudsman and Parliament needs to be avoided through ongoing and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions has also issued a special invitation to the Ombudsman to investigate the systems used by EPSO, again with a view to protecting the rights of candidates, especially young candidates, in the European Parliament’s competition procedures, and to investigate alleged discrimination reported at the European School in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">In this year’s report, Madam President, the focus is on the Ombudsman’s role as a key actor in the Union’s democratic life. He is a vital intermediary for citizens in their dealings with public authorities. His effective activities highlight the distinction between good and bad administration, offering guidance on recognising mistakes, and seeking satisfactory solutions for complainants, likely to transform bad conduct into good.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it would be valuable if the Ombudsman were to draw up a list of best administrative practices, including not just exemplary cases, but less creditable ones as well. One of the cardinal principles that always has to be stressed is the democratic equality of all Europe’s citizens, without any distinction or discrimination on the grounds of nationality or language; something on which the Ombudsman can rely in his continuing efforts to scrutinise and protect linguistic equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the Ombudsman’s annual report is considered more quickly, and it is also in favour of amending the Statute, provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the Ombudsman’s powers, without affecting the nature of his competences or the non-binding effect of all his decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Madam President, the Commission should ‘take a leading role in promoting a service culture’. When the Ombudsman said this in the introduction to his Annual Report, I could not agree more. The European Union needs to be closer to its citizens, to explain better, to listen better and to deliver good policies. To have a top-quality public administration is a necessary condition for that. To have a well-equipped watchdog to monitor our progress is equally important to our common success. The Ombudsman acts as an external control mechanism for sound and accountable administration on the part of the European Union institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore very much welcome the Ombudsman’s Annual Report for 2006, and I want to stress that the relations between the Commission and the Ombudsman are very positive. For example, the number of open enquiries addressed to the Commission decreased by 20% in 2006 in relation to 2005 and 2004, and we more frequently acknowledge our mistakes and apologise. We seek satisfactory solutions for complainants, just as we follow up the critical remarks and the draft recommendations of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome Ms Sbarbati’s very important report and the constructive proposals in it. Just as I agree with the Ombudsman’s call for a service culture, I agree with Ms Sbarbati’s call for the necessary budgetary and human resources. We are judged by our deeds and not by our words, so we need to really ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses, as Ms Sbarbati says in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly comment on a few particular points in the report. First, the Commission welcomes the Ombudsman’s initiative to draw up a list of ‘star’ cases exemplifying best practices. We also welcome this initiative to prepare a study on the follow-up given by the Commission and other institutions and bodies to the critical comments and further remarks of the Ombudsman. I hope this can contribute to improving practices to the benefit of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding the alleged overlaps between the activities and powers of the Committee on Petitions and those of the Ombudsman, the Commission reiterates its willingness to work with those two bodies within the framework of their respective remit, and the definition of that remit does not fall within the Commission’s competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Parliament has requested the Commission make proper use of its discretionary powers under Article 226 relating to infringement procedures. Of course, we should avoid delays or failure to take action, and that is why the Commission recently adopted a communication on the implementation of Community law, and we laid down more targeted preventive measures, improved information provision and problem solving. In short, this was the Commission’s new commitment: to seek a more efficient management of infringement cases and increased transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents, as you know, the review of this Regulation is under way, and the Ombudsman’s contribution to the consultation has been very much welcomed. Only a few weeks ago we had a meeting with the Interinstitutional Committee on public access to documents which was chaired by Vice-President Wallis, and I want to thank her for taking this matter about public access to documents forward in a very constructive way.</p>
<p class="contents">My penultimate point concerns the Ombudsman’s Statute. It is being dealt with in a separate context but, as it is mentioned in the report, I just want to assure you that the Commission closely monitors the developments, and that contacts are under way between the Commission and the Ombudsman at different hierarchical levels. I want this issue to progress in a spirit of close cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, concerning the Ombudsman’s communication strategy and the European network of Ombudsmen, we need to share experiences and administrative practices. We need to raise public awareness and to bring citizens closer to the EU. The Ombudsman has a very important stake in this, and so does the European Parliament and the Committee on Petitions. This is important to me and the whole Commission, and you can be sure that we will do our absolute best to cooperate and find good, forward-looking solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the secretariat of our committee for its assistance in drawing up Mrs Sbarbati’s report, and also the European Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, for promptly submitting his annual report for 2006 and for his subsequent cooperation with the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman is an independent institution and a control mechanism for the administration of the EU. However, despite all the action taken by Mr Diamandouros to inform the public, confusion still reigns over the European Ombudsman’s areas of jurisdiction. We must therefore continue to try and inform the public, with appropriate financial support from the EU. For this reason we, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, have again tabled a relevant amendment, which calls for ever greater participation by the media in publicising the work of the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur, I have tried to contribute to the report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, with amendments that I have tabled and supported. It was essentially through the adoption of these amendments that we saw progress in the following areas of the European Ombudsman’s activity:</p>

<p class="contents">The Lisbon Treaty just agreed opens the door to the European Union’s exit from a long-standing phase whereby its ability to function effectively on behalf of its citizens has been held back. We have a long-needed institutional system that works more effectively, but it also opens the door to so much more.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the solemn proclamation of the Charter of the Presidents of the Institutions that will be made on 12 December. The inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as part of the legal order in the European Union will allow for the Union to begin to work on more effective, transparent and democratic foundations. European citizens expect, and will continue to expect, that the Union’s institutions will act in accordance with its basic principles: with the Charter, and with efficiency, effectiveness and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman is one vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union. The largest proportion of the Ombudsman’s enquiries concern lack of transparency. This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of the citizens. I am delighted with the work of the Ombudsman, as explained in his annual report and in his speech. He took a number of important decisions during 2006, including, not least, on the choice of the languages used in the websites of the European Presidencies of the Council, on inaccurate and misleading information contained in leaflets, posters and video presentations on air passenger rights produced by the Commission, and on access to the audit report of the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman, as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions, as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures. Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require a greater investment of resources by the institutions, in order that the citizens’ concerns are properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would like to remind Members of Paragraph 2 of Ms Sbarbati’s report: ‘Calls for all European institutions and bodies to be given the necessary budgetary and human resources to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries, complaints and petitions’. There will be no better way of putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice than taking this on board, and I call on all the institutions and bodies to give priority to the interests of the citizens in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the years the role of the European Ombudsman has become ever more important for the citizens of the European Union. Once the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enters into force, that role will become even more important. This means that in the future we have to be even more careful to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources and that the code of practice under which he operates is relevant to the current climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Margot Wallström stressed the need for transparency. I would hope that now that the code of practice under which the European Ombudsman operates is changing, the Commissioner’s words, increased transparency and promoting the idea that the necessary information is available from the Commission, will come true, because only deeds matter, not words.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s annual report and its summarised version are a splendid example of how our work should be presented to the public. The report is clear, succinct and to the point. Transparency is the key to European democracy and its principal construction material.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union. That is saying a lot, and it places an obligation on all the European Union institutions and obviously on the Ombudsman’s office too. Consequently, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring there are adequate resources of the relevant kind in place, so that people do not have to wait years and years for decisions on matters that affect them, because waiting for decisions is a tiresome business.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the Ombudsman for the work he does, and I wish him every success in this very challenging role. It is not always appreciated sufficiently, as fundamental rights are implemented more successfully among the elite than among ordinary people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am expressing the views of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group as well as those of Mr Marcin Libicki, the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who was unable to attend today’s sitting and asked me to speak on his behalf.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Hominum causa omne ius constitutum sit</span> – every law should be applied from the point of view of human beings. This Roman principle can be seen in the work of the Ombudsman, who, working within his area of competence, tries to comply with the fundamental principle that everyone has the right to have their case heard in an impartial and just manner by EU bodies and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be seen from an analysis of the report that only about 25% of the complaints submitted fall within the scope of competence of the Ombudsman. Is it that our citizens do not know the law? Perhaps, to some extent, this is the case. However, I think that it is something different, that they treat the institution of the ombudsman as a last resort, when they are unable to find appropriate help in their own countries. The scope and quantity of applications submitted to the Committee on Petitions would indicate something similar. If the feeling that one is being treated in an unjust, sluggish, incompetent or bureaucratic way continues to grow, the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour will just become a collection of aspirations, and not everyday practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Professor, may you, as the Ombudsman, be an effective guardian of the interests of the Community’s citizens, and may Parliament, the Council and the Commission, as well as national parliaments and national ombudsmen, assist you in this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, I would like to say something that must be underlined. I am a relatively new member of the Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, as it would be better to call it. I have, to my consternation, discovered through being out in society that it is virtually only active citizens who are monitoring whether EU legislation is being respected in many places. The institutions are not doing this, and neither are the Member States. Therefore, if citizens do not do it, the whole thing will fall apart. Therefore, citizens are not only the victims of individual cases; they are indeed also active fellow players who are working to ensure that the EU’s extremely transparent system is both understandable and close to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be clear that it is a perpetual battle even if we equip our instruments, i.e. the Ombudsman and the Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, with the correct tools. An attack is currently taking place on the Swedish system of openness and access to documents. We must not believe that this is a battle that we can win once and for all. We must persist and continue to persist and we will not win the battle at any point. We will win it only if we continue to have very strong tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that I am very pleased with Mrs Sbarbati’s report. However, I would like to highlight the amendments that we have fortunately been able to incorporate into the report thanks to considerable support. Firstly, it is now possible for Parliament to take the Ombudsman’s cases to court if the institutions do not respect the Ombudsman. It is absolutely crucial that this can be done in reality and is not simply something that we can boast about around the world. We have the institution of the Ombudsman, we have a Committee on Citizens’ Complaints, and yet this does not mean anything other than words and yet more words. This matter is therefore of enormous significance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect concerns the European Investment Bank. On many occasions the bank has not been as ‘nice’ as it should be. On many occasions it has acted as if it were assisting the major industries, and it is absolutely crucial that the citizens who should benefit from the bank’s activities in countries outside Europe have the opportunity to bring matters before the Ombudsman. It is really quite shocking that they are refused on the grounds that they are not EU citizens and are not able to have their say. They have been treated in a patronising and arrogant way, and I am therefore also very glad that it has now been highlighted in this report that these citizens will naturally have access to appeal to the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say that it is important to emphasise that the Ombudsman also has competence within intergovernmental areas under the third pillar. Overall, we are taking a big step forward with this report, and I very much hope that the bodies of both the Commission and Parliament will take it seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A large section of the public is calling for greater transparency and exemplary administration, which are too little in evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I note some worrying signs in Mr Diamandouros’s report. Fewer cases have been resolved by friendly settlement. There has been a decline in the number of cases where the Commission (I see that the Vice-President is not listening) has complied with the recommendations of the European Ombusdman.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulating the European Ombudsman, Madam President, is not enough; we must listen to his recommendations. Mr Diamandouros is quite rightly requesting an extension of his powers to cover third-pillar issues, thus providing for greater transparency and control. He is asking for a change to the European Ombudsman’s Statute so that his work can become more effective.</p>

Mrs Sbarbati also tells us that the majority of complaints come from the larger Member States, with larger populations, but goes on to say that the figure changes if the ratio between population and number of complaints is considered, when Luxembourg and the new accession countries Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia take the lead with the largest number of complaints. This reflects, in my view, the fact that issues of a European nature and of European competence and legislation are the main concerns of the Ombudsman’s day-to-day work.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is interesting to note, however, that it would be more useful to have functioning Ombudsmen in those countries and in particular in Italy than to have a European Ombudsman. I think I remember reading that in the 95% of cases examined, the majority do not fall within the mandate of the European Ombudsman, as the complaints are not made against a Community institution or body.</p>
<p class="contents">Cases of maladministration relate to lack of transparency, unfairness, abuse of power, legal error and so on. There are no data on administrative inefficiency and injustice in my country, and I am sure that if such data existed and were brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman, Italy would be well in the lead, especially the left-wing administrations of my country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that the wrong use of the discretionary powers of the Commission is well in the lead in the ranking, and I would therefore exhort the European Ombudsman to scrutinise relations between citizens, the Council, the Commission and Parliament more thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that the Ombudsman’s scope of investigation should be extended to cover the protection of minors, family problems, the protection of personal data and prisoners’ rights, and for that reason I support the Mavrommatis amendment. However, I do not support, Mrs Sbarbati and Mr Mavrommatis, the exhortation to conduct inquiries under the so-called third pillar. That is wrong, and I do not agree.

<p class="contents">Three hundred or so complaints a month is a huge workload and equates both to rising interest in the system but also to rising concern at aspects of EU maladministration. Whilst many cases are dealt with by cooperation, the Ombudsman refers to the increase in critical comment that he is forced to make. This must improve, or Parliament will have to find ways of compelling the Commission to be helpful and responsive and, equally, to act upon the conclusions produced by the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">He makes telling comments. I want to pick out one: ‘I am not sure that the citizen can easily reconcile the statements often made by the institutions that they want to get “closer to the citizen” with the fact that the very same institutions frequently fail to take up the opportunities offered by the Ombudsman to improve relations.’ The services of the Ombudsman should, and do, work hand in hand with the Committee on Petitions, but the Commission must develop a culture of service rather than the avoidance of problems, and Ministers and permanent representatives must understand the vital importance of responding positively to grievances from constituents and citizens, voiced either through the Ombudsman or the Petitions Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I make a brief reference to an outstanding special report by the Ombudsman, namely that relating to a complaint against OLAF. As the Petitions Committee rapporteur for this issue, I give notice now that, the judicial process having been completed on this case, I will not allow the issue of the special report to be swept under the carpet. It will be reconsidered as soon as is practically possible.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thinking behind her report. She correctly brings out the Ombudsman’s key role in the EU’s democratic character.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am worried that although there have been fewer instances of maladministration, the Ombudsman’s critical remarks, in those cases where a friendly settlement was reached, did not meet with a satisfactory rate of acceptance by the institutional bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right, then, to remind us of Parliament’s right of recourse to the Court, although, of course, one would prefer not to use this right. However, all of us here today should understand that we ourselves are the institutions – and the corollary of this is that the reliability of the institutions depends on our own attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree entirely with the rapporteur’s view of a balanced but at the same time energetic way of performing one’s duties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman is not, cannot and should not simply be a display of democracy for the EU.

<p class="contents">The European citizen was, is, and always will be, the centre of our efforts as a functioning Union. It is mainly for this reason that the activities of the Ombudsman are of such paramount importance. This is because the Ombudsman is the friend and guardian of the European citizen and is the facility through which Community institutions and bodies can be held to account over whether they have served the citizen properly and whether they are guilty of maladministration or bad practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the 2006 Annual Report from Mr Diamandouros and congratulate and thank him for the very good work he and his staff have performed in upholding the rights of European citizens. At the same time, we congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Sbarbati, on her excellent report, which contains many important points and suggestions. I find most interesting, for example, the suggestion made in paragraph 12, which in effect encourages the Ombudsman to draw up and publish annually a list of shame and a roll of honour for the EU’s administrative services.</p>
<p class="contents">May I point out that the proper functioning of the Ombudsman may inevitably, in rare instances, lead him to be disliked by certain services. In such cases, the Ombudsman deserves – and must be reassured of – our full support.</p>

Every 16th complaint submitted to the Ombudsman comes from my country. Every 20th complaint, almost, is written in Polish. Obviously I am speaking of absolute numbers, because, per inhabitant, the citizens of Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus are much more active in submitting complaints than my own countrymen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth emphasising that last year the European Ombudsman received fewer complaints than in 2005. Just over 200 complaints came from companies and associations, and 18 times more than that came from individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be said that the functioning of the European Ombudsman provides the best indicator of computer use in the European Union. Twelve out of 20 complaints are submitted electronically.</p>
<p class="contents">On the minus side, an indicator of the lack of knowledge of EU citizens is the fact that almost four out of five complaints do not fall within the scope of responsibilities of the European Ombudsman. This shows that this institution is treated as a receptacle for all maladies, even those that do not relate to EU institutions, which, by definition, is what the European Ombudsman is supposed to monitor. Clearly Europeans feel that the European Ombudsman has the right to crack the whip over everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express satisfaction that only 8% of the investigations instigated by the Ombudsman related to the European Parliament, while almost 66% related to the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Ombudsman’s criticism regarding a lack of transparency is necessary and badly needed criticism. I also welcome Parliament’s proposal that the Ombudsman should carry out a study of the practical impact of critical remarks that were made, inter alia, in relation to the Commission. Certainly, Parliament is often touchingly united in criticising other institutions, but there is actually good reason for Parliament also to be self-critical. The Ombudsman has recently asked Parliament to disclose information on payments received by MEPs for travel and for employing staff, but Parliament has <span class="italic">refused </span>to disclose the information, taking the view that it is a breach of data protection. I believe that this is merely putting up a smokescreen, and I have the support of the European Data Protection Supervisor when I say this. Payments to staff are obviously public documents. It is time for Parliament to come clean on payments. Only those who employ staff on slave-type contracts and other strange contracts have something to fear from more transparency. It surely cannot be the case that any Members here are afraid of not being re-elected in 2009 if it emerges in the media how employees are treated in certain cases, I say in certain cases.

<p class="contents">Of the 3 889 complaints, 3 051 were outside the mandate. In other words, there were, in a single year, a total of 838 complaints within the mandate. I therefore think that the Ombudsman’s department is large enough in terms of staff and resources to handle 838 complaints, which, of course, mainly concern matters of maladministration by the Commission and the European Personnel Selection Office, and to a lesser degree the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course commendable that the Ombudsman publishes a list of best administrative practices. I do not know, however, whether his department allows citizens to make complaints about the operation of his own department. I regret that the report by the Committee on Petitions refers us only to the European Personnel Selection Office, and not to the European Ombudsman, who until now has not carried out an <span class="italic">ex officio</span> scrutiny of his department.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore requesting not a change in the Ombudsman’s Statute, but rather a strengthening of the rights that we already accord him. This should allow him to show due respect for citizens, be very active in the correct administration of European institutions, and respect the personal data of citizens, Members of the European Parliament, and employees who are required to maintain secrecy. The European Court of Justice should operate independently, without the Ombudsman’s intervention, and there should be respect for the effective international agencies that operate independently to protect fundamental rights.</p>

It is important that this debate is taking place at a prime time in Parliament’s plenary working day, at a time when it can have a high public profile.</p>
<p class="contents">The service that the Ombudsman provides is extremely important for the citizen: it enhances the positive connection between Europe’s institutions and the citizen and enriches the legitimacy of the work we do in the institutions, whether it is in Parliament, the Commission or the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The service continues to evolve and that is pointed up quite well in Ms Sbarbati’s report, where she makes various suggestions, and the Ombudsman himself makes various suggestions, as to how it could continue to improve. Certainly, the idea of broadening relations with mediators who deal with issues regarding minors and children is an important development.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is resistance in the system: resistance to transparency, resistance to a common code of administrative practice for all the institutions and resistance, as well, to updating the mandate of the Ombudsman. I believe the European Parliament should take a more active role, for instance, in dealing with the transparency issue, and I support the Ombudsman’s call for Parliament to be more transparent in the publication of allowances paid to Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The material presented raises some issues. The first of these is that the largest number of complaints submitted to the Ombudsman relates to the European Commission, the European Personnel Selection Office and the European Parliament. The failure of European institutions, with the exception of the Ombudsman, to implement the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour in accordance with the 2001 Resolution of the European Parliament may be a contributory factor. The second issue is that 78.5% of the matters submitted to the Ombudsman fall outside his competence, and 93.7% of these complaints do not relate to EU bodies or institutions. This would indicate that our citizens do not have sufficient information about the work of the Ombudsman or that, for various reasons, they are unable to get important issues dealt with in their own countries. This matter needs to be investigated. The third issue is that the Ombudsman should have the powers that are necessary quickly to remove bad administrative practices that give rise to complaints.</p>

I hope that they understand what the Ombudsman is about, following his very detailed presentation of twelve months’ work in a very short space of time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that the Ombudsman receives so many cases that it is not within his competence to resolve, but I understand that these are redirected to the appropriate places. It is important to say that to people listening to this debate. Those cases do not fall by the wayside, but are sent in the right direction. That you are dealing with a certain number of cases and bringing about a resolution is positive, but we need to do a bit more work to educate people about what you do and how you do it, in order to bring even more cases to your desk. That would do no harm, because I am sure the small number you deal with does not truly reflect the problems of maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Commission, I quite like the idea of a culture of service, but I am not sure that the Commission uses the carrot and stick approach internally to make sure that there is indeed a culture of service. This is something that should be done through legislation. Are there penalties for divisions or individuals involved in maladministration when it comes to citizens? Perhaps that is something we could have a closer look at.</p>
<p class="contents">I like the idea of putting forward the star performers and the worst performers so that we can have that comparison, but at the end of the day what people want is results and positive outcomes. I keep saying to people in Ireland that the Committee on Petitions does not have huge power, but that through the work we do we can act as a pressure point for action. I wish we had more power, but at least we can use that little bit of pressure to bring about results for citizens. They are not interested in the process. They just want positive outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Diamandouros, I wish you well in your activities this year and hope you continue in the same way as in the past. I will certainly work in Ireland to make sure that we know a lot more about you in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We welcome the content of the current report, which shows that the task of the European Ombudsman has become established and has bedded in; it also shows increased contact with authorities and with citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I particularly welcome the agreement with the current Government of Spain on the use of co-official languages – Basque, Catalan and Gallego, as this will bring the citizens of Spain closer to their rights without diminishing the functionality of Spanish, which will prove very useful in future contacts with third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, other aspects noted by Mr Diamandouros himself, which are a source of concern: more than 75% of complaints are not about European competences but national or regional competences. We therefore take the view that it is a matter of great urgency to strengthen the communication strategy of the European Network of Ombudsmen so that this can be put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem highlighted is the fall in instances of maladministration concluded by friendly agreement or consensus. We supporters of the Ombudsman urge him to improve his know-how and recover his effectiveness in this route. Persuasion is better than force.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I shall only add that it would be ironic if the legitimate ambition of the current Ombudsman to apply the Code of Administrative Conduct led him to be more diligent outside his home than within it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The office of Ombudsman is today well established and I would like to congratulate it on its good work. We now need to look ahead to ensure that the tools that citizens have at their disposal for seeking redress are clear, known to all and function more efficiently. At present there is too much confusion regarding where citizens should go when they want to make a complaint. Some appeal to the Committee on Petitions, some to the Commission, some to the Ombudsman, and some appeal to everyone, which results in a great deal of confusion, duplicated work and unnecessary expenses that could all be avoided. There is therefore a need, as Commissioner Wallström rightly said, for better coordination between the institutions that hear and make decisions on complaints. For example, there should be a clear commitment regarding the time within which these agencies must reply to citizens once they receive their complaints, and also a commitment regarding the maximum length of time they can take to give a definitive reply. We still hear all too often about complaints that were lodged years before and are still pending. As my colleague Ms McGuinness has stated, when a complaint is sent to the wrong agency, that agency should not send a negative reply but should itself pass the complaint on to the correct agency. Finally, when a citizen formulates his complaint in an unclear manner, because, after all, not all citizens are lawyers, a greater effort should be made to ensure that whoever receives the complaint gives the complainant the benefit of the doubt and does not automatically consider the complaint inadmissible. I think we have taken huge steps forward and once again I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman, but we still have a lot more to do. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 2006 activity report proves to us that, nowadays, European citizens benefit from a true competent court where they can defend themselves against any institution and, in fact, prevent and signal their defective operation. In other words, we speak today about a true instrument of democratic control, performed in an autonomous and transparent manner, which can only be beneficial to the European Union. Moreover, I am grateful to the European Parliament’s Rapporteur for pointing out the aspects to be improved in the Ombudsman’s current activity as well. First of all, I regret the fact that there are still many complaints from citizens who have not obtained the information requested in their own language. This proves to us that, in Europe, we still have problems in ensuring full linguistic rights and equality among citizens. We are on the brink of the year 2008, declared the year of intercultural dialogue, and are forced to immediately correct these deficiencies, which are contrary to the European Union’s fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">In my turn, I welcome the European Ombudsman’s communication strategy and I emphasize the need to consolidate it.

It is encouraging to see the information presented in the report on the Ombudsman’s activities in 2006, showing his dynamic involvement in the public life of the Community and his active cooperation with both EU citizens and the administrative bodies of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To improve the effectiveness of the Ombudsman’s activities it would be worth considering the possibility of preparing lists of best administrative practice, with exemplary or exceptional cases in which the Ombudsman was involved in any given year, as well as a list of the cases where the actions of institutions were less appropriate.

I also wish to thank the very large number of Members who, in fact, took the time to comment on my report. I am deeply grateful for the interest that this expresses and the guidance that it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Ms Sbarbati, let me just say that I of course worked very closely and intend to continue to work very closely with the Petitions Committee, with which I have excellent relations. The Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman will continue to be the major instrument through which this august body will also be able to deal with citizens’ approaches to the European institutions. I take note of your remarks. I can tell you that I have already launched an own-initiative inquiry concerning EPSO, as you know, but I want to announce it to this body. I also have taken a strong interest and continue to monitor very carefully developments in the European schools.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Ms Wallström for her remarks. I note that she has recorded the increase in the number of cases where the Commission apologises for instances in which its services have not abided by best practice. I am very grateful to her for acknowledging that. I will be meeting with Ms Wallström in the near future, and I will also be meeting with the Directors-General of the Commission and the coordinators of all the services dealing with the Ombudsman, precisely in order to be able to bring about better coordination and better results. This is an indication of how closely I am working with the Commission, and I hope to be able to elicit better results to report to you next year, and of course to report to citizens. That includes the infringement, and I will be dealing with that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general point, let me just say that I am very grateful to you for your general support on broad issues like the culture of service, which is very central to my concerns; for your references to the need for more resources for the Ombudsman; for your support on the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Statute; and for your call for greater accountability, which for me of course is extraordinarily important. I can also let you know that I have launched, as of this year, a concerted effort to reach out to business associations as opposed to individuals, with an eye to better informing them of their rights as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the pressure of time, allow me not to switch languages, but first of all to say to Ms McGuinness and also to Ms Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, that I manage to help 70% of the 70% that are outside my mandate. Therefore, my work involves not only the percentage that is within my mandate, but on top of that there is a great deal of effort being expended by my staff to be able to help every single citizen who comes to us whose concern is outside the mandate, by referring to the appropriate institution, be it at European or national level. Therefore, this covers 3 830 cases, not 885.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to switch languages. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Ombudsman. (EL)</span> Mrs Panayiotopoulos, I want to assure you that the European Ombudsman is fully aware of his obligation to work within the legal limits. He will, of course, always work according to the basic principle of accountability to Parliament and to you, and at all times he will be acutely aware of his responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am doing all I can to promote the creation of a national ombudsman in Italy. I have been there four or five times and I will continue to do so, hoping that we will be able to welcome an Italian national ombudsman into our midst in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first concerns the reform of the Statute of the Ombudsman. I can tell you that, very early on, the Ombudsman kept us informed about the work on the new Statute, and we have been in constant touch about this. Of course, there are some things we could easily approve, but others are more complicated. The Commission will formally give its opinion only after Parliament makes its proposals. We have also met with Ms Jäätteenmäki, and we are looking forward to her report with interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The other direct question was from Ms McGuinness about the carrot-and-stick approach and whether we applied it. No, not enough, I would say – or not yet. But what we have been doing over the last period of time is to create more of a visibility of these issues and also create an ownership within the Commission for every directorate-general and through all the hierarchical levels in the Commission. I think that creating that sense of responsibility and visibility will help us to encourage and also sometimes to make it known when we are not pleased with how individual officials are dealing with cases. I think it is rather rarely the case of an individual official making a mistake; it is more about the culture. This is what we have in the walls, and this is what we have to change now. I think the reforms we have taken will move us in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just finally mention one thing that I hope will be welcomed by the Commission as well as the European Parliament: we are working with citizens’ summaries on our proposals. Again, to come closer to citizens, we also have to express ourselves not in EU jargon but in plain language, and I hope this will help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report rightly emphasises certain priorities for the Ombudsman in the future: the importance of cooperating with ombudsmen in the Member States, for example, and the proposal for better internal supervision of how EU bodies are managed.</p>
<p class="contents">It also raises two questions, however, which we omit from the European debate at our peril. On the one hand, the Ombudsman’s activities must entail a review of the institution’s profile and accessibility throughout Europe. There is, in fact, a downward trend in the number of cases referred to the Ombudsman (3 830 in 2006, a decrease of 2% from 2005), and complaints tend to come from Member States that already have a culture of encouraging people to raise issues with the relevant national institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the report considers the question of extending the Ombudsman’s powers (with regard to accessing documents and the unconditional hearing of witnesses). No amendment to the Statute of the Ombudsman must be allowed to obscure the major role played by Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, which draws its legitimacy directly from the ballot box. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the context of its deliberations on the Commission’s proposal for the amendment of the Regulation on the funding of European political parties, the Committee of Permanent Representatives decided yesterday to split the Commission’s proposal in two and to adopt the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulation in a separate legislative instrument, to be created on the legal basis that applies to amendments to the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This would mean that key elements of this legislative process would be taken out of the sphere of parliamentary codecision and that the Commission, contrary to its own convictions, would have to present a new proposal, while it would also be essential, or at least advisable, to consult the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament calls on the Council to reconsider its decision. The amendments to the Political Parties Regulation proposed by the Commission are necessary to overcome practical difficulties that have arisen in its application. They would also make it possible to continue supporting the development at the European level of political foundations, which play an important part in opening political processes to public scrutiny. For these reasons, it is imperative that the proposed regulation should enter into force very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 October, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs adopted a report expressing willingness to compromise with the Council to pave the way for the rapid adoption of the proposed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The splitting of this instrument by the Permanent Representatives has thwarted these efforts. It is legally unnecessary, undermines the Commission’s right of initiative, curtails the rights of Parliament, and is likely to cause significant delays.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Conference of Presidents I call on the Council to overturn at ministerial level the decision of the Permanent Representatives.</p>

It is a serious matter when the European Parliament – the chamber of the people at the European level – is excluded from the legislative process relating to a regulation on European political parties. That is truly a subject that concerns all of us here, whatever our party affiliation. It is unthinkable that the bureaucracies in some finance ministries and then their governments should decide on this issue rather than the people’s representative assembly of the EU. We should not stand for that! With regard to the budget for 2008, let me say that the national governments have wishes which they can only fulfil together with us. When dealing with the 2008 budget, this Parliament should remember what the Council decided yesterday with regard to this Regulation on the European political parties. Thank you for your statement.

<p class="contents">The Commission opposed that splitting of its proposal for sound legal reasons, but also for political reasons. The decision introduces uncertainty as regards timing, when we want the proposal to enter into force before the end of this year so that the foundations can be fully functional before 2009. That was the whole idea behind the proposal. We also think that the whole proposal should be approved by codecision, under Article 199 of the Treaty. We regret, therefore, that Coreper decided, against the Commission’s will, to reduce Parliament’s role in an issue intimately related to Parliament’s business, namely the financing of the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Just 36 hours after the Committee on Constitutional Affairs approved by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal, Coreper decided to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and of Parliament.</p>

At its meeting this morning – Thursday, 25 October – the Conference of Presidents unanimously chose the winner of the Sakharov Prize. For his commitment to the all-too-long-forgotten victims in Darfur, the Conference decided that the prize would be awarded to Salih Mahmoud Osman.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For more than 20 years, Mr Osman, a human-rights lawyer and member of the Sudanese Organisation against Torture, has been defending countless victims of the conflict in Darfur who have been arbitrarily imprisoned, driven from their homes and tortured or who face the death penalty. His seat in the Sudanese Parliament now enables him to bring their cause to the attention of the international community, though sometimes at great personal sacrifice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Osman champions the cause of dialogue and justice against violence and tyranny. Without democracy there can be no justice. By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman, the European Parliament would like to support the work of this courageous man who has become the voice of Darfur and, through him, to support the establishment of the rule of law in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">The formal presentation of the prize will take place in Strasbourg on Tuesday, 11 December.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, the Committee on Budgets voted on more than 1 600 amendments to the 2008 draft budget. Inevitably, there are a small number of technical adjustments that I hereby request to be put to the vote in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">After the vote, the Committee on Budgets issued a request to retable the following four amendments:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 990: + EUR 1.53m on line 16 03 04, commitment appropriations only;</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 24: on line 15 05 55, commitment appropriations only, reserve and remarks as in Amendment 938;</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 989: + EUR 1 million on line 16 03 02, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations;</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 1043: + EUR 1 million on line 15 06 06, commitment appropriations, and + EUR 1 million in payment appropriations, plus additional remarks from Amendment 25, with the figure EUR 1 million instead of EUR 1.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">These technical changes and specifications were dealt with and approved at the meeting of Committee on Budgets of 11 October 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Frontex, a technical error was identified subsequent to the vote in committee concerning the remarks. The correct modification to the remarks is contained in Amendment 1133, which is annexed to the voting list.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the remarks adopted in Amendment 634 do not appear in Amendments 1018 on budget line 15 02 02 05; 934 on budget line 09 06 01; 938 on budget line 15 05 55, and 940 on budget line 17 02 02. And, on budget line 09 03 03, the right figure for commitment appropriations should be 5 and payment appropriations 4.85.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Sittings Service to make the necessary corrections in the Minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, we held a discussion at the coordinators’ meeting yesterday and, according to their decisions, I recommend rejecting Amendment 752 and voting in favour of Amendment 610 on line 16 02 02 (multimedia actions), but taking the reserve from Amendment 752, and rejecting Amendment 1044 and voting in favour of Amendment 32 on line 16 02 03. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course no budget is perfect, but we must nevertheless strive to spend common funds in a just and future-oriented manner. Unfortunately, most of the European Union budget continues to be spent on preserving the conditions of the past. This is why it is important to ensure that some money goes towards the future, towards research, development and science. The financing of the European Institute of Technology still needs to be resolved, because the Commission has proposed a bridging solution of a maximum amount of EUR 308 million. Budapest would be an ideal location for the European Institute of Technology, owing to its excellent research results and the scientific expertise it has gathered in combating climate change. This is another reason why I am keen to see a resolution to the issue of financing. We Hungarians are able to provide an appropriate location for an Institute that is modest in size, economical, but all the more rigorous in terms of its intellectual basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We think that the adopted proposal was a good compromise and, even though we lost out in some respects, we fully support the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted in favour of reducing export subsidies in agriculture, but think that it is unreasonable to vote in favour of a complete and immediate withdrawal of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We also voted against continued subsidies for tobacco producers and in favour of limiting the number of Parliament sessions in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Daphne (protection of children, women and young people against violence), we voted in favour of increasing the appropriation up to the level of the Commission’s proposal. However, we had been prepared to vote in favour of further funding, but were given no opportunity to do so because the amendment never went to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution from Mr Virrankoski (<a href="/doceo/document/A-6-2007-0397_EN.html">A6-0397/2007</a>), we Swedish Social Democrats voted against an amendment which, among other things, called on the Commission to ensure that no farmers would receive more than EUR 50 000 per year in direct aid from the EU. This is a discussion which is ongoing, so we agree with the spirit of the proposal, but do not consider it appropriate to set either an exact sum or specific conditions right now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 553 million euro cut-back in agriculture, operated by the Council, was mainly reestablished, and the reserve created on the Commission’s administrative funds is justified by the delays recorded in approving the Sectorial Operational Programmes and Rural Development Programmes. At the second reading of the European budget, the Council of Ministers should not perform additional reductions in the agriculture funds or structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment submitted in the plenum for limiting the farmers’ income to maximum 50,000 euros per year is unjustified. Such an artificial barrier would prevent the best farmers from developing their work profitably. Moreover, this restriction will contribute to breaking down the agricultural works and to the decline of European agricultural competitiveness. For this reason, I rejected the amendment providing for this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2008 budget, in the form we adopt today, is a budget that makes the European Union institutions accountable. I support the proposal to transfer 49 million euros from the funds allocated to the Commission to reserves until it submits a clear report on its human resources policy, especially as regards the recruitment of new employees from the countries that have recently joined the European Union – Romania and Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence the Committee on Budgets’ incomprehensible and unacceptable rejection of our proposal that sought to ensure, for example, that Portuguese should be one of the working languages in EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly meetings, particularly considering the Members of Parliament of various countries represented on the Committee whose official language is Portuguese.</p>
<p class="contents">-	Secondly, the worrying and growing tendency to reinforce appropriations for a ‘strong information policy’ in the context of the (re)‘launch’ of the ‘reform’ Treaty and the next elections to the EP in 2009.

It is estimated that over 200 million euros would be saved annually from the European tax payer’s money if it was decided to establish the Parliament’s headquarters in Brussels, not only due to the inherent cost reduction, but also by facilitating interinstitutional work. At the same time, groups from the civil society have drawn attention to the serious environmental consequences of the frequent transportation of the European Members of Parliament and civil servants from city to city for the proceedings of the European legislative activity.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I consider that the idea to maintain two annual plenary sessions at the Strasbourg headquarters is unjustified. This would aggravate the situation of the administration costs, since payments will be made throughout the entire year to prepare such sessions, as regards costs related both to the premises, and to the personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous civic initiatives, of which at least one benefits from over one million signatures from most Member States, request the elimination of the duality of the European Parliament’s headquarters.

The fact is that criminal law in Europe today is not standard – indeed far from it. Different countries have not only different legal traditions and values but also different criminal laws. The Member States’ criminal law systems reflect their respective identities.</p>
<p class="contents">Examples of disparity in criminal law at national level are many and varied. For example, the protection of freedom of expression and the definition of what constitutes a violation of freedom of expression differ markedly from one country to another. It would therefore be very dangerous to insist that a penalty handed down in one country should automatically be applied in another: dangerous not only for those who come before the law, but also for the rule of law generally.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need to tread very warily indeed here, because it is currently impossible to ensure the application of certain common basic standards in the law of criminal procedure. I am thinking particularly of respect for the principle of double jeopardy, of the right to a genuine, rather than a merely formal, defence and, indeed, of victims’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two fundamental principles that must always be followed and observed – otherwise the rule of law will cease to exist. They are the principles of legality and legal certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Partnership Agreement between the EC and Mozambique came into force on 1 January 2007 for a period of five years, and, compared with the previous agreement, it provides for an increase of 2 000 tonnes in the Community fishing quota for tuna or tuna-like species.</p>
<p class="contents">In the previous agreement, the extent to which Portugal used its entitlement to fishing opportunities (five) was rather high, which is why Portugal asked for nine licences for surface longliners, plus continuation of the opportunities in demersal freezer trawlers fishing for deep-water shrimp. However, it was only awarded seven licences for tuna fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the previous distribution of licences and (non-)respect for the principle of relative stability in the light of the increase in fishing opportunities, this new agreement therefore involves a marked imbalance: Portugal only gains two more licences, while the other Member States gain a further 16 (France) and 13 (Spain).</p>

In this context I should like to refer to the last colony in the world, the last colony in Africa, namely the Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Morocco for more than 30 years. This occupation infringes international law and is accompanied by flagrant violations of human rights. When we champion the human rights of the Saharawi people and their right of self-determination, we often hear that we are adopting a pro-Saharawi stance. That is an appalling attitude, for our sole aim is to uphold human rights and international law. All European institutions should be devoted to this cause and not merely pursue the economic interests of the Member States. Europe needs to adopt a credible stance against dictatorships. Wagging our finger at a few selected dictatorships damages the credibility of the Union as a peace broker, and damages those who suffer oppression and are subjected daily to gross violations of their human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various arguments presented during these debates have demonstrated that a statute for European private companies may bring benefits to small and medium-sized companies, and there has also been support for the idea of a stakeholder consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises that the regulatory framework needs to be adapted to allow SMEs to make the most of increasingly integrated European markets. We need to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized companies to conduct cross-border business. It is important to take action that will help those firms to fully reap the benefits of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth of small and medium-sized businesses is crucial, as we all know, for the competitiveness of the European economy, and the Commission can see that a European private company statute could facilitate the expansion of small businesses beyond national borders. Therefore, by providing an option, it would create more choice for companies, without imposing any additional burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">It could well reduce the compliance costs for firms that wish to operate in several Member States. If this can be achieved, SMEs could have easier access to new markets. The Commission is therefore aware of the importance of the European private company statute to the Member States of the European Union and to European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy, will proceed with a legislative proposal for a European private company statute, as he declared to the Legal Affairs Committee on 3 October 2007. This proposal should be ready by mid-2008 at the latest. As you know, we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal, the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year. My colleague Mr McCreevy will be very happy to have a continued dialogue with you once this proposal is on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I may say we are delighted that, after protracted difficulties, the Commission has finally been convinced of the need for this legislative draft, and that we can now expect to receive it. It is to the credit of Parliament that this was made possible by the heavy pressure we exerted. Be that as it may, we can only rejoice wholeheartedly at the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, intend to address a second point to which today’s resolution also refers, and on which we are not satisfied with the way things have developed. I refer here to the 14th Company Law Directive on the transfer of the company’s registered office, the place where companies are registered. For many years the European Commission has had plans to close this loophole in company law. We have now learned that this has been more or less deleted from the legislative programme, at least as far as the European Commission is concerned, and that the loophole will therefore remain open.</p>
<p class="contents">May I emphasise at this point that my political group at least – and, I believe, an overwhelming majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, to judge by the tenor of its deliberations in recent years, and of this House as a whole – has always taken the view that this loophole needs to be closed and that the 14th Company Law Directive is a necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a matter of additional bureaucracy and new corporate obligations. It is simply about giving companies the opportunity promised them in the Treaty to move freely within the European Union and establish themselves in any Member State. We have heard that one of the reasons why the European Commission felt unable to move forward on this issue and to present a proposal was its view that the existing merger regulations and other provisions were adequate to guarantee corporate mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say that, if a company cannot move its registered office within the single market unless it founds a new company in another country and then merges with it, the present rules are scarcely exemplary as a means of avoiding red tape or minimising costs. The ideal would be a sound piece of secondary legislation that guaranteed the right of companies to exercise in practice the freedom that the single market offers them in theory.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the arguments advanced for the <span class="italic">status quo </span>is that past rulings of the European Court of Justice have greatly liberalised company law in any case. That is undoubtedly true, but the European Court delivers these rulings for the sole purpose of promoting the full application of primary law, simply because the legislative bodies responsible for the adoption of secondary law, namely Parliament and the Council – though we depend on the European Commission – are not able to enact sound secondary legislation that would actually guarantee the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty provisions establishing the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Parliament is adhering to its position that the Commission’s monopoly on the right of initiative binds it to present a proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive in due course. We ask the Commission to reconsider whether the 14th Directive, which is already on file in the Commission’s offices, can be incorporated into the legislative programme in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">If that does not happen, Parliament reserves the right – as our resolution expressly states – to invoke Article 192 of the Treaty and table a report on its own initiative with a view to requesting a legislative proposal. And while we are on the subject of company law, let me take this convenient opportunity to say a brief word about the Commission’s latest communication on the simplification of company law. The resolution does not deal directly with that communication, but there is a thematic connection between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we in Parliament agree that we do not support any erosion of the substance of established Community law and practice – the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> – as a consequence of simplification measures. In other words, there can be no question, in my view, of deleting entire directives. What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies, to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations, to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant. I believe there is scope here to cooperate closely with the Commission in order to improve company law.</p>
<p class="contents">One other thing that struck me when I read the Commission’s documentation on this subject was that there are certain laws we have enacted – one example being the Transparency Directive, adopted in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act – which contain some provisions that now beg the question of why they are not being reviewed as part of a simplification drive. I should also welcome further consideration of this matter by the Commission, since such a review would likewise help to improve company law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done so on behalf of the European People’s Party Group, and I shall do so on behalf of the Party of European Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern at present is, as Mr Lehne has said, that we are relying too heavily on judicial development of the law, in other words, on development through the case-law of the Court of Justice. The case-law of the Court of Justice fills in the gaps left by the secondary law of the European Union, but we do not have secondary law. The Treaties are very general in nature and provide for certain fields and give rise to various interpretations and do not at present facilitate the establishment of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals are bi-directional, as Mr Lehne has pointed out, firstly they support the offer made by the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on the European private company which would clearly do a great deal to help establish free movement within the European Union, and secondly to try to continue pushing in the field of company law by pressing for a new directive, the fourteenth, which could ultimately supplement those provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mr Lehne’s concern that, if we do not adopt provisions on the transfer of company head offices, then we would in fact be leaving a legal loophole open because mergers are a different matter and do not fall fully into this category. We hope the Commission can include this type of activities in its work programme.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I hope that during 2008 and, if possible, before 30 June, the proposal for a directive, the Directive on the European private company statute, will be on the table, and, secondly, it is to be hoped that the Commission does not give up on the idea of continuing to develop company law in fields such as freedom of establishment and change of domicile for companies.</p>

<p class="contents">In answer to the first, I think it is clear. In answer to the second, concerning the 14th company law directive, we had suggested that a further means of improving mobility might be a directive stipulating the conditions for the transfer of registered offices in the European Union. The results of the economic analysis of the possible added value of a directive were inconclusive; companies already have the legal means to effect cross-border transfer. Several companies have already transferred their registered office using the possibilities offered by the European Company Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon, the Cross-Border Mergers Directive, which will enter into force in December, will give all limited liability companies, including SMEs, the option to transfer their registered office. They could do so by setting up a subsidiary in the Member State to which they want to move and then merging the existing company into this subsidiary.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s view, it is only if this framework is found wanting that future legislative action in the shape of a 14th company law directive can be justified. Therefore, Mr McCreevy has decided for the moment not to proceed with this 14th company law directive, but I will certainly communicate your concerns again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say with some regret that some of the politicians in the European Union and some governments apply double standards, in that much more is said about human rights in the countries with which there is no trade, where one cannot do business. In the case of countries with which economic ties are maintained, even unofficially, without saying anything, but making money, people seem to speak about human rights more quietly, in a whisper. It is very good that the European Parliament is not whispering when it comes to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">In the joint resolution that we are proposing, what I would like to emphasise over and above political divisions, is that we list new, specific and tragic facts that illustrate the drama that is taking place before our eyes in that country. The attention of the world’s public opinion is focused on something else, on certain attempts to create a nuclear power in that country or on the clearly anti-Semitic statements of the President of Iran. Unfortunately we do not notice the breaches of human rights in that country, so it is good that the European Parliament is considering this issue today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That country, which has all the natural resources for achieving an envious standard of living for its people, is unfortunately sinking deeper into the abyss of dark ages-like totalitarian governance, with the resulting gross violations of the human rights of its citizens, and with Iran becoming more and more isolated from the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The continued practice of barbaric acts such as the stoning to death of citizens, including women and children, and the non-recognition of the quality of the rights of women and of political opponents, is a stigma to civilised living. Every day, reports reach us of even more cases of arrests, torture and killings of innocent civilians by the authorities of Iran.</p>

<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr Tannock.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is pretty much non-existent in that country, and all this at the same time as the secretive work to produce nuclear weapons is going ahead against all common sense and in spite of international outcry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iranian regime, blinded by short-sighted nationalism and extreme religious fanaticism, is following a road that can only lead to confrontation and consequent suffering, mainly to its own people. Let us once again, on the occasion of voting for this resolution, send a message of support to those Iranians fighting for freedom and democracy, and let us again make clear to the extremist rulers of Iran that our patience is running out fast owing to their foolishly dangerous behaviour.</p>

It’s a cruel and evil government’. Doris Lessing also said that the reason nobody dares to criticise the Iranian government is because of oil. I think she could not have been more accurate and could not have put it better.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy of appeasement is lethal, not only for the interests of the Iranian people, but also for everyone who wants peace. The continuation of this policy and the fuelling of the Iranian regime’s expansionist and fanatical instincts will be the greatest tragedy we will face in the near future. I believe we must all be aware of that fact and must reverse this policy.

Firstly, the appalling human rights situation that has developed as a result of a regime based not on democracy and human equality, but on its own interpretation of the will of God, which gives it the right to imprison, torture and murder others.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the attempt by the regime to win mass support, despite its role as a violent minority. It is artificially attempting to appeal to national pride. The reason for that pride is the possession of nuclear energy and possibly even nuclear weapons, just like India, Pakistan and Israel, which have not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, opposition to the regime. Both the moderate opposition, which wants a slightly less strict system, as was the case under the previous president, and the real democratic opposition amongst workers and students in Iran, and also amongst intellectuals who have fled abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the American threat to use the same model in Iran as in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a military invasion or at least bombing. Such an attack by foreign opponents would be counter-productive. That would encourage patriotic feeling on the part of the Iranians, and they would rally to the support of the hated regime and its nuclear weapons, if any.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is not in favour of a military invasion against the regime, or of seeking friendship with that regime out of self-interest. We should show solidarity with the victims and the opposition. The regime must not in any way be given the impression that it is possible to negotiate restrictions on the rights of the opposition in exile in Europe, and must not be allowed to spread propaganda by claiming that democratic countries support its misrule.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice’s decision to remove the People’s Mujahidin organisation from the list of terrorist organisations should be fully complied with, so that that organisation and other opposition groups do not face any legal or financial obstacles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, as has already been noted, the growing deterioration in the human rights situation. Secondly, the record figures for executions, not only in numerical terms but also in the brutality with which they are being carried out. Today we have more executions than there were in the whole of 2007 – 244 in 2007 and 177 in 2006. The third element is the persecution to which organisations for human rights activists are being subjected, especially those organisations which defend women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all this justifies not only this resolution but also, as the resolution states, urging the United Nations General Assembly to vote on a resolution explicitly and unreservedly condemning the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. This is something we have been asking for for a long time. We do not understand why there is this reticence about it and I hope that this resolution will at least help to change some minds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what is happening in those countries that call themselves Islamic countries? They are governed by extreme radicals. The only message that comes out of these countries is one of hatred of the outside world, of fellow Muslims and of their own citizens. What is happening in present-day Iran is absolutely unacceptable. On many occasions we have already talked in this Chamber of the need to apply radical measures in order to prevent various types of breaches of human rights in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly horrifying is the way that the death penalty is carried out. Carrying out the death penalty by stoning is uncivilised, inhumane, and completely unacceptable to any democracy. Carrying out the death penalty on minors, which is prohibited in the whole of the democratic and civilised world, continues in Iran, despite the promises of the Iranian government and parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Further acts of hatred are aimed at any opposition – both the very small internal opposition from individual citizens, and the much larger and more organised opposition both within the country and from beyond its borders. Arrests of journalists, lack of freedom of speech, bans on printing or even speaking under threat of imprisonment or even death, this is a situation that we cannot in any way accept. Today, any appeals seem almost to be too late. We should think about more specific restrictions that would force the Iranian government to change its behaviour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can tell you that we have all repeatedly expressed our great concerns about the human rights situation in Iran – I, myself, very recently during the UN General Assembly, on the margins of which I met the Iranian Foreign Minister, where, again, I very strongly emphasised all the facts that are there.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the respect for basic human rights in Iran has continued to deteriorate seriously over the past year and, for this reason, we will also support the new UN General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, as we do each year, which Canada is likely to table.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a continuous clampdown on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and political dissent. There have been new cases of torture and executions of people who were minors at the time of the alleged crime. There has also been an increasing number of public executions, as Mr Romeva i Rueda said, including in one case through stoning, despite assurances by the Iranian side that stoning was forbidden under existing decrees. I also very specifically mentioned this case when I met the Iranian Foreign Minister. Iran has carried out at least 250 executions so far this year – the second highest number of executions worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note, of course, the continuous discrimination against minorities, increasing harassment and the closure of independent non-governmental organisations. The documented intimidation and persecution of human rights defenders from all sectors of Iranian society has grown, as has the repression of intellectuals, teachers, students, women activists and trade unions. Only recently, one of Iran’s best-known human rights defenders, Mr Emaddedin Baghi, was once again imprisoned under the charge of propaganda against the Government. And, since July, Mr Mansour Osanlou, President of the Iranian Bus Drivers’ Union and the embodiment of an independent trade union movement in Iran, has been under arrest. Mr Osanlou is in need of urgent medical treatment, which, we have reason to believe, he has still not received.</p>
<p class="contents">But we are not remaining silent about such developments. We have taken numerous steps and repeatedly issued public statements denouncing the ongoing violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran, as well as the country’s persistent failure to uphold international standards on the administration of justice. Once more, I call upon the Iranian Government to fully respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with Iran’s obligations under international law and the conventions it has ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to reiterate our concern about Iran’s refusal to resume the bilateral dialogue on human rights it suspended in 2004, which the European Union continues to ask for. For our part, we remain ready to do so, as we believe in the importance of such a dialogue and engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission is, speaking quite unequivocally, in full agreement with Parliament, whatever the developments on the nuclear issue or on other issues of concern to the European Union. And we have this double-track approach, which, at this moment, Javier Solana and his new counterpart are working on, and, at the same time, we are also working in the United Nations Security Council with regard to maybe a further strengthening of sanctions. At this moment, there can be no real progress in the relationship with Iran without a serious improvement in the human rights situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our thoughts go out to all of those who were affected by that dramatic action.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan is a nation which we in Europe should care deeply about. It is a great trading nation, it is an exporter of people, not least to this continent, and it is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism. It is a matter, therefore, of great sadness that, in its 60-year history, Pakistan has failed to become a true democracy; but, on the other hand, we should be encouraged by the fact that it has not become a theocracy or even a permanent military dictatorship. Once again in Pakistan, the window is opening for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We await the outcome of the court ruling on the legality of the President’s election. We call on President Musharraf to accept the outcome if it goes against him, but I also call on people in Pakistan and throughout the world to accept the ruling of the Court if it rules in favour of the President. I think it is the only basis on which we can move forward in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the election in January, I hope that the Government will pursue and continue to prepare for that election, and will make it possible for Ms Benazir Bhutto to campaign in a secure fashion. In saying that, I know we imply that the Government was behind the bombing; I do not believe that, but we need to make sure that the security of all the candidates is guaranteed and the Government does its best to protect Ms Benazir Bhutto. I also believe that Mr Sharif should be allowed to return to the country and campaign if he so wishes, and again have his security guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The military should stand back during the whole period of the election campaign, and I hope, before January – and, indeed, before campaigning begins – that the President will get himself out of uniform and turn his country into a true civilian government. That is the best hope for the future of Pakistan, and it is the best hope for relations between Europe and Pakistan: that we get a democratically elected parliament in January, with the President out of uniform, in ‘civvies’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I must say with a heavy heart that month after month here in Parliament we have to decide on different resolutions because such large parts of the world around us fail to respect civil liberties and rights and violate fundamental human rights. I must say this because I think it is so terrible that it just goes on and on. We talk about it here in Parliament, we talk about it in so many different contexts, and still it goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Pakistan, which is the subject of the resolution we are now discussing, I want to say that the GUE/NGL Group supports the resolution in its entirety. The resolution makes a large number of very justified demands on the government in Pakistan. We in the world around it cannot keep silent about the influence and decision-making power of the military regime in all areas of society. Power must be transferred to a civilian democratic government. We must support all voluntary organisations, everyone working for democratic liberties and rights. I particularly want to stress the importance of paragraph 16 of the resolution. In that point Parliament expresses its great concern at the fact that a large proportion of Pakistani women are <span class="italic">not</span> able to participate in the democratic process. People are being oppressed in Pakistan by the military regime on the grounds of religion, but we must not forget the oppression to which a large proportion of Pakistani women are exposed. Our Group wishes strongly to support the entire resolution. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is related to the practice, which is also incomprehensible because of its incompatibility with the will to resolve the situation, of continuing to export or seeking to export arms to Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">To give but three examples: in 2006 the Government of the United Kingdom authorised the export of 15 000 rifles to the region, including Pakistan; France continues to seek to sell Pakistan missiles and radars to build a combat aircraft which Pakistan is allegedly developing with China; and Germany has also been responsible for exporting significant quantities of munitions, arms and other types of military equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that to that end the desire to resolve the situation in Pakistan is incompatible with supplying it under those policies. I therefore suggest and ask my colleagues to support the amendment seeking the suspension of all types of exports of arms and military equipment until such time as it can be guaranteed that they will not be used to violate human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan becoming a rogue state controlled by Islamist fanatics is, quite frankly, terrifying.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not especially a fan of Benazir Bhutto, whose period in office as Prime Minister was marked by widespread corruption, but, ultimately, a democratic and secular-leaning government under civilian control is always preferable to a military dictatorship, compromised in this case by its links to Islamist parties and the Afghan Taliban. President Musharraf is supposed to be our ally in the war on terror; sometimes I wonder how committed he is to rooting out terrorism in his own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Hopefully, Ms Bhutto’s return to Pakistan may be a fillip for human rights now. One major concern is the ongoing repression of religious minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Ahmadi Muslims. If she is to be taken seriously as a progressive leader of a more modern Pakistan, she must make sure that Pakistan respects its international obligations under human rights conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">But, while Pakistan faces many challenges, we should recognise that some progress is being made in some areas. The economy continues to grow, and Pakistan has also engaged in confidence-building measures with India with regard to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p class="contents">One question which remains totally unanswered is how, legally, the Pakistani Government, in spite of a Supreme Court judgment permitting former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to return from exile to Pakistan, deported him immediately to Saudi Arabia. How, in international law, can a government deport one of its own citizens? Nawaz Sharif may yet have a vital role to play in re-establishing multiparty civilian democratic politics in Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a large and important country with a troubled history. The State of Pakistan was artificially created as a home for the Muslim inhabitants of India, and it therefore has an Islamic identity, which is something we cannot now hold against it. That was more or less its original <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that we should not battle against Islamic extremism, and indeed the Pakistanis themselves are devoting considerable efforts to that very struggle. Pakistan was an important ally in the face of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, in dealings with Communist China, and in the context of long-running Soviet attempts to gain influence in India. It was an important strategic factor for the West.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it goes without saying that Pakistan has internal difficulties, of which we must be aware: a complex and heterogeneous population structure in ethnic and religious terms, widespread poverty and, of course, the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. We must clearly lend the country a very great deal of support in establishing free elections and a stronger independent judiciary, and must encourage the military command to hand over power gradually to elected politicians. Above all, as Charles Tannock said, we must encourage Pakistan to keep pursuing the confidence-building process with neighbouring India.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect there have been encouraging signs, and the purpose of a balanced policy on Pakistan is to reinforce those signs while expressing any necessary criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Pakistan, who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent, accountable rule, and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, of course, why we put the stress on the need for a return to democracy and civilian government with free and fair elections in January as being the only way to answer the challenges of Pakistani society.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we also stress the need to remove the militarisation of Pakistani society and deplore the failure of President Musharraf to stand down as army chief, as he promised he would. The rule of law is extremely uneven in Pakistan. There have been some encouraging developments at times, but these are also accompanied by some very repressive judgments. This falls particularly hard on minorities, religious and otherwise, as well as on women. We rightly call for improvement in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">This as well, of course, as deploring the suicide bombing and the 140 victims and 500 injured last week. I fear that these could become a pretext for restricting political activity, because already there has been an announcement by the Government that political parties will only be allowed to hold meetings in well-secured parks and public grounds rather than organise processions. One could see how that might be made a pretext.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the more close-to-home reasons for my wanting Pakistan to fight both extremism and militarisation, and to return to the rule of law, is the impact on British people of Pakistani origin, with the calls, for instance, for profiling or for visa requirements for the United States. It would remove that threat to people like my constituents if Pakistan were to be a democratic society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would like to extend our full sympathy to the families of the victims, and we also appeal to the Pakistani authorities to bring those responsible to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">This attack on a peaceful gathering has clearly demonstrated, once again, all the dangers of terrorism and fundamentalism to the people of Pakistan. Ms Bhutto was right in describing this horrible event as a blow against democracy, particularly in the present electoral context of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s wish to express solidarity with the people of Pakistan is both very relevant and timely. We in Europe should encourage a more open, democratic society and, of course, a strong civil society in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also of fundamental importance that the elections should then provide maximum democratic legitimacy to the incoming assemblies, and the vote must be democratic, transparent and giving equal opportunities to all the political contestants.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, it is one of those countries where we might envisage a possible election observation mission. In this context, my services carried out an exploratory mission in June, and they identified, I have to say, important shortcomings in the framework and the conditions for elections, including concerns about the independence of the Election Commission, the completeness and the accuracy of the voter register, restrictive candidature provisions, as well as lack of transparency in the results process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with urgent political will, there is still time to improve a number of these problematic areas and, therefore, I have not yet taken a full decision on whether we will deploy a fully-fledged election observation mission. I really have to see the aforementioned elements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the majority of people in Pakistan would like to see a moderate, stable and democratic Pakistan, and we should support them in achieving this aim. We are doing a lot, for instance, on the trade side, in order to help people to get out of poverty, but we also do a lot on the education side, in order not to have pupils and young children being educated in the madrasahs and being educated towards extremism and fundamentalism. But we should also support this because it is of crucial importance, as has been said, for the whole region, including neighbouring countries like important Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have every reason to stay engaged. This is what we are trying to do and, therefore, this debate is a very timely one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A show of popularity for democratic forces and a clear emphasis on human rights, and not an army, are the biggest barriers to the rise to power of radical groups. That is why these are things which now require our support, as do religious minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience of human rights work shows that freedom of religion is an important indicator of the situation with respect to human rights; it is a kind of litmus test. The problems are visible first in the status of religious groups and as flaws in the system of freedom of speech and right of assembly. There is a correlation between the state of play of democracy and the status of minorities: wherever the opportunities the people have to participate are poor, minorities also suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">We might say that Pakistan’s particular problem is the misuse of the law on blasphemy with regard to religious minorities. There should be a system of the protection of religious values, not active persecution of people of other faiths. Although the law is not targeted at any particular religious groups in terms of its content, the everyday reality is otherwise. Death sentences are handed down mainly in respect of minorities. Legal reform is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Only democracy will make this possible. The unfortunate decision by Musharraf to keep his position as army chief has had an impact on Pakistan’s social development these last few years, and has weakened it. The gradual militarisation of society has been regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we express our support for Pakistan in its fight against Talibanisation. We feel solidarity with those Pakistanis who are affected by last week’s devastating bomb attack.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month I had the chance to familiarise myself personally with the political situation in Pakistan. I had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties, senators and members of parliament. I especially want to mention, however, the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, whose important work as the representative of many minority groups deserves the attention and support of the outside world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

The news that, at the end of September, a murderous attack took place against an African Union base in south Darfur, resulting in the death of 10 peacekeepers, the serious injury of eight other personnel, and the apparent taking hostage of approximately 40 people more, has come as a grim reminder that, despite our efforts, much remains to be done in order to secure peace and stability in this sad corner of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, of course, recollect that at least 200 000 people have died in Darfur during the four-year conflict, and more than two million people have been forced from their homes. The September attack on African Union peacekeepers must force the EU and the UN to make sure that peacekeepers in Darfur are adequate in numbers and training, that they are properly and fully equipped and that they are given adequate logistical and other necessary support in order to fulfil their task safely and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Merely sending poorly trained and ill-equipped AU civilians into highly hazardous situations does not, as has been demonstrated in this case, serve any useful purpose other than to reduce the cost in terms of money but increase the cost in terms of human lives. An urgent rethink and replanning by the international community is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage. Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has, as yet, been no change in the situation, and further attacks like that of 29 September remain possible. The General’s alarm call must be heeded by the international community and particularly by the European Union, which could surely issue a powerful appeal for effective joint action by all the Member States involved in providing the promised EU support.</p>
<p class="contents">In two days’ time, important talks are to take place in Libya between the Sudanese Government and various rebel forces. It is still unclear whether Abdel el-Nur – the founder of the Sudan Liberation Army, now exiled in France – will take part in these talks. Indeed, there is just as much uncertainty about other figures representing the array of rebel forces, for their numbers change from one day to the next. Be that as it may, we have to prioritise these discussions, which have the potential to produce a ceasefire. So once again we would ask the European Union authorities to spread the word as widely as possible about the importance of the meeting and about Europe’s intention to support any positive developments that may come out of it, both militarily and in relation to improving conditions for aid workers, who are operating in a particularly difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that the Government in Khartoum, through its actions thus far, bears a huge share of responsibility for today’s tragic situation – and not only because it has supported the Janjaweed militias bringing death and terror to black African communities. It was also the Government that categorically refused, for months, to accept the presence of a Western force in Sudan. It was also the Government that made it impossible for journalists and foreign observers to gain access to the most troubled regions, even though their work there could make a major contribution to the ongoing mobilisation of international public opinion. That mobilisation is clearly needed if we are to ensure that all of us in Europe shoulder our responsibilities in combating what must be recognised as nothing short of genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is that the new European force, due to deploy in eastern Chad and the north of the Central African Republic, will make it harder for the rebels to move freely across the borders with those countries and to pursue their policy of recruiting fighters, willing or otherwise, from refugees’ and displaced persons’ camps. Anticipating this obstacle to their activities, some armed groups are already turning their attention to the other side of Darfur, to the neighbouring region of Kordofan, to which Haskanita is a gateway. Here too, the support the European Union has undertaken to provide may prove very useful, although within a short time it may also prove quite inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus part of our task to continue doggedly doing what we can to bring about political conditions in which European intervention will be effective. Surely we have seen enough violence and heartbreak in this region of the world? Not only have hundreds of thousands of lives already been lost, but the social fabric of Darfur is also being utterly devastated, so the task of reconstruction becomes more problematic from day to day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The context is quite important, because the attack occurred shortly before Desmond Tutu was due to conduct meaningful talks in Darfur. It seems obvious that the attack was deliberately timed to thwart the quest for a diplomatic solution, which is so desperately needed in that region. There followed lengthy speculation, of course, as to the identity of the rebel group that had carried out the attack, which claimed the lives of ten soldiers from the AU peacekeeping force. The signs seem to indicate that the most likely perpetrators were a pro-Western rebel group.</p>
<p class="contents">When we deal with the Darfur issue, it is important not to focus too narrowly, but to remember that the most widely diverse rebel groups from the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic are operating there in addition to the local armed forces on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very revealing that the attempt made by the European Union to act on the Darfur conflict through the Chad mission is effectively in a sorry state at the present time. At the start, the talk was about sending an EU force there. In fact, a French force with a few additional troops has been sent there under the EU banner. I have not yet been able to obtain any proper information about that force’s actual area of operation. Although we are still being told that the force is essentially there to protect refugees, most of the refugees are to be found in the border area, which is precisely where the Government of Chad does not want the EU force deployed. Perhaps the Commissioner can assist again with some information.</p>
<p class="contents">What the EU is doing at the moment is definitely not what is needed to defuse the present situation We have to say very clearly that the very thing Desmond Tutu wanted, namely a diplomatic solution, is what we ought to be supporting here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the civil war that has continued for almost 50 years has claimed at least two million victims in that country. Over 4.5 million people have been forced to leave their homes. In Darfur, where the conflict broke out at the beginning of 2003, about 200 000 have died and nearly two million have been driven from their homes. This is the result of terrible battles, purges and terror. This is currently the most tragic humanitarian crisis in the world, and it is further aggravated by hunger and the lack of water.</p>
<p class="contents">One should therefore be grateful to all those who undertake peace initiatives in this tortured land. We should address such thanks to the African Union, which sent a 7 000-strong peace mission there. The most recent attack on this mission, which took place in Haskanita, aroused strong objections. At least ten dead and about 50 lost or kidnapped. This is a clear breach of existing agreements as well as of United Nations resolutions. I would like to express my sympathy to the families of these persons.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, acting as the European Union, demand that those responsible be punished and that the peace process be reinstated. The planned forces of the UN mission together with the African Union will number about twenty thousand more soldiers. However, they must have some possibility to neutralise the armed conflict and help bring stability to this explosive corner of Africa. I hope that the European Parliament’s decision to award the Sakharov prize to the Sudanese lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman will be helpful in making a breakthrough in the Sudanese drama. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I also wish to remember all the civilians who were victims, and who are victims in the situation in Darfur, with particular reference to the brutality with which certain assaults with clear sexual overtones are being carried out and serious violations are taking place in terms of the way women are used on a variety of fronts, including sexually.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all of this requires not only actions and declarations but a solid investigation which should be carried out not only by the people on the ground but also by the International Criminal Court. That, for me, is one of the fundamental aspects of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also wish to note that we should welcome the fact that there is currently permission – to give it some kind of name, from the Government of Sudan to accept UNAMID troops but at the same time we should also note that on other occasions they have broken this commitment, broken this promise and therefore we should maintain a degree of caution.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, naturally, that it is necessary to continue to insist, while at the same time, as Mr Pflüger said, ensuring that the forces which go, go with a broad United Nations mandate, and not only to back the interests of one country in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe it is also essential and necessary to recall that all aid must be made available, whether political, financial or technical as may be required to perform the duties that that mission will have to face on the ground. It is not possible to send a mission into the field without its having guarantees that it will be able to fulfil its mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and again very significantly, I would like to note, and here I undoubtedly go beyond the words of the Resolution, which urges the government of Sudan to follow the demands of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, to arrest Ahmed Haroun, Sudan’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, specifically so that he can be held accountable for the displacement of two million people in Darfur, thereby instigating an international trial which should have begun some time ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was in Darfur with a delegation from our Parliament in July. During our visit we met representatives of AMIS, the African Union Mission in Sudan. It was, and still is, an incredibly difficult mission, as we heard from some of these AMIS representatives. For example, one of the commanders, a Nigerian general, told us that he felt as though he were a priest rather than a soldier. All he could do, he said, was appeal to people to refrain from evil acts; he had no real mandate to act, and so it is hardly surprising that rebel factions have exploited this weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">The West is not focusing sharply enough on Africa. There is an imbalance between the extent of the tragedy in Darfur and the level of attention we devote to it. Military operations in Africa are all very well, but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission. When the EU conducts operations there, its forces must be armed with a robust mandate, appropriate equipment and sufficient manpower. The duration of the mission must also depend on its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not hide behind others, but must fulfil our own obligations. This applies to the funding of AMIS and to support ranging from logistics and military equipment to personnel. Above all, however, we need the political will of everyone, and it is my opinion that peace in Darfur and the whole of Sudan can be achieved only in cooperation with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The units of about 100 troops, most of them Nigerian, fought off the first attack before falling back to trenches, firing through the night until their ammunition ran out. Then, ten were killed. At least 40 fled into the bush. The attackers looted the compound before Sudanese troops rescued the survivors. A week later, Haskanita itself was razed. When the UN inspected the damage, only the school and the mosque were still standing. About 7 000 people are thought to have fled. Then, on 8 October, fighting erupted in the town of Muhajiriya, controlled by a Darfuri rebel faction. Scores were killed.</p>
<p class="contents">No one is sure who the attackers were. Even the Government of Omar El Bashir came under suspicion. But it could be the rebels. What we know is that these things will continue to go on until there are international forces with an effective mandate and with effective means there. Everybody knows that, and it is time to stop this game of hide-and-seek with the Government of Khartoum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must realise that this suits the genocidal strategy of the Bashir clique in Khartoum to divide and destroy the Darfur communities and the rebel groups in order to make peace negotiations, such as the ones that are supposed to start this weekend in Libya, go nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">That appalling attack and the violence which followed also demonstrate the fundamental limitations of an all-African force in Darfur such as AMIS. It is, therefore, crucial that the African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which is to be deployed by early January, will actually be duly equipped in full force and capacity to operate by then.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is very disturbing that the Chairman of the African Union Commission, Mr Konaré, has been insisting on an all-African force, even rejecting the integration of units offered by Uruguay, Thailand and Norway into UNAMID, in contradiction with the UN Security Council decision and, in this way, echoing the manoeuvres of the clique in Khartoum.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also disturbing that the European Union, the US and other rich countries have been failing to provide the speedy and full support that they should give to the deployment of that mission, namely by not providing it with a financial airlift and other logistical and military capacities that it needs to operate. Even the Chad mission is very much delayed, and that was supposed to be ‘urgent’.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Bashir is going to be given a red carpet welcome in Lisbon: it is not only Mr Mugabe. I hope that the European Union authorities, the Commission and the Presidency and the Member States will not fail to take that opportunity to actually confront him with this tremendous responsibility that, one day, will bring him to The Hague. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people died trying to help their fellow humans in a neighbouring country. Many have been affected by violence, rape, murder and extreme poverty here. How many times have we stood here and talked about it? How many times have we demanded that the government or others take action? Let me remind you that the central task of any government is to protect the human rights of its civilian population. This government has never attempted or tried to do this in its entire career. However, we must still be patient in our frustration, as it is only through long-term economic and political support for those who are endeavouring to resolve the conflict that we can do it. We must not altogether ignore our own economic interests. Sometimes it is our own oil companies that are actually supporting certain groups, indirectly or directly. We must address this too. A <span class="italic">heavy </span>responsibility rests with the government, and we must make further demands. I agree completely with my colleague Raül Romeva that the International Criminal Court must be given full access rights and a full right to investigate, so that the people in this stricken country can see justice in due course.

I congratulate this motion for deploring violence, for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan. ‘We must show a united front’, the motion suggests; and, whilst I applaud the notion, I fail to see how this can come to pass. You see, the UN itself is implicitly divided on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts can only go so far while China, a deciding member, continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms. Once again, we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum. China exchanges Chinese weapons for Sudanese oil, and it is not rocket science to see that this is one of the most important ways in which the ongoing conflict is being sustained.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy. Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years. With Chinese arms exports – some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago – estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year, the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">If this issue remains unaddressed, it is not just Sudan that will suffer. Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal. So, finally, I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people. For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN, but we must do this actively – if not, we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do regret, though, that once more we have missed an opportunity to raise the matter of the responsibility and disastrous role of China in this conflict, because it has to be said again that, in seeking influence in Africa, China is playing a pernicious role in war-ravaged Sudan.

At least eight other personnel from the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) were also seriously injured and another 40 remain missing. I urge the Sudanese Government to cooperate fully with an independent investigation into the attack and to bring all those responsible to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">These deaths are a reminder of the gravity of the security situation in this region. Unfortunately, there is no peace to keep at the moment but, nevertheless, the international community, including the UN and the European Union, have a responsibility to try to help secure this region as soon as possible so that peace can be realised in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union mission to the Chad, Central African Republic and Darfur border must also be mindful of the danger of incurring casualties. No one said this was going to be an easy undertaking. It is crucial that EU Member States mobilise political, financial, logistical and technical support for the Irish, French, Belgian, Polish and other troops forming part of this mission. We cannot have our troops ill-equipped, like the beleaguered AMIS. If we are putting our troops in a volatile environment, we must give them the means to protect themselves. This EU mission will have a robust use-of-force mandate, with reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and troops should be encouraged to invoke it. Peacekeeping is one of the noblest professions and it is tragic when a peacekeeper loses his or her life whilst protecting the lives of others.</p>

Two hundred thousand people have lost their lives as a result of ethnic cleansing and pogroms, and a further two and a half million have been displaced. Millions of refugees live in fear of what the next day will bring, and they have a force of just seven thousand poorly equipped soldiers from the African Union’s peace force, which, increasingly, is becoming the focus of bloody attacks, such as the attack in Haskanita in September of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in this region is dramatically worsening, and representatives of humanitarian peace organisations are falling victim to kidnappings. In this situation it is important to act as quickly as possible to put into motion the joint UN and African Union mission, which, now that it has the agreement of the Sudanese government, must also have a strong mandate allowing it to provide full protection to the civilian population. The mission must have the appropriate number of soldiers and the appropriate quantity of equipment and funds. The European Union, the UN and the African Union must make joint efforts to renew the peace process in Darfur and to help to find a just and lasting agreement that is signed by all interested parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should not pretend that even the larger peacekeeping force due to take over from the current African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) will be able to protect itself easily to ensure the vast humanitarian operation supported by the European Commission and so many other donors and to keep the peace if there is no peace to keep. This is the question.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge the acceptance by the Government of Sudan of the presence of the UN peacekeeping force on Sudanese soil. Along with the rest of the international community, we intend to keep the Government to its word. We welcome the intention of the Government to declare a cessation of hostilities when negotiations commence in Libya on 27 October, yet the Government needs to go further. The European Commission also calls upon the Government of Sudan to engage meaningfully in negotiations intended to result in the equitable sharing of power and of wealth in Darfur. We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause. We also call upon them to participate wholeheartedly in the talks in Sirte.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, as you know, UN Security Council Resolution 1778, adopted on 25 September, mandates an international multidimensional force to contribute to the stabilisation of eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic and thus also guarantee the security of the local civilian population, refugees and displaced people and stabilise the situation in Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council on 15 October decided to send an interim and multidimensional European force of 3 000 troops, EUFOR Chad, as we call it, to support and complement in the short term the deployment of the UN contingent. Taking into account the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis, the deployment of this new EUFOR Chad mission and of a UN police mission in parallel with UNAMID in Sudan is, I think, a crucial step towards facilitating a durable solution of the conflict in Darfur and, ultimately, also towards the voluntary return of the Sudanese refugees who have settled in Chad. I can tell you that, at this very moment, an Irish General is there exploring the situation and exploring where exactly EUFOR should be deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">But coming back to the question of Sudan itself, let me say that we firmly believe that the future of Sudan lies in the sharing of wealth and power, in a federal government and a federal arrangement. This is what the Government and the rebels agreed in Naivasha in January 2005, when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed, ending decades of civil war between the north and the south. The international community must stand firm behind this Comprehensive Peace Agreement. For if this agreement can be made to hold – yes, it is at present in difficulty, but these difficulties need not be terminal – this will demonstrate powerfully that similar arrangements can surely be extended to Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the long-term equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country, we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We also back the efforts of the EU Special Representative to Sudan to facilitate peace in Darfur and, along with other donors, we stand ready to ensure that the peace dividend, in the shape of the rehabilitation and recovery of Darfur, follows closely on the heels of a renewed peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We think it is in the interest of all the parties – the Government, the Darfur rebels, the countries of the Horn of Africa region and the international community – that Sudan stays together. However long and arduous, and at times discouraging, the Sirte talks might turn out to be, I think we must be steadfast for peace in Sudan. The unity of this country remains within our grasp. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>European foreign policy and European energy security policy are becoming increasingly inseparable. In its report on a common foreign policy on energy, the European Parliament calls for institutional reforms and the creation of an EU solidarity mechanism. This mechanism would, among other things, ensure that Member States’ energy companies have the same access to energy reserves in the event of a disruption to energy supply. This is a complex undertaking. It requires tripartite agreement between the Commission, national governments and energy companies.</p>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The development of a common approach to external energy policy is a priority and must be accelerated.</p>
<p>The priorities approved by the European Council in March 2007 for an international energy policy, especially relationships with producer countries, include intensifying the EU’s relationship with Central Asia, the Caspian and the Black Sea regions with a view to further diversifying sources and routes, and intensifying energy relationships with Algeria, Egypt and other producing countries in the Mashreq/Maghreb region.</p>
<p>The guiding principles of this external energy policy, the functioning of the markets and diversification are defined in detail in the joint paper from the Commission/Secretary General/High Representative entitled ‘An External Policy to Serve Europe’s Energy Interests’, endorsed by the European Council in June 2006.</p>
<p>European energy security is another area of priority actions, such as those approved by the European Council in March 2007: the security of supply must be enhanced on the one hand by measures falling within the framework of the internal market, such as the facilitated integration of new power plants into the electricity grid of all Member States, improved regional cross-border exchange and measures to accelerate the development of regional energy cooperation, for example, while addressing the challenges of peripheral energy markets and facilitating the integration of regional ones into the EU internal market.</p>
<p>The European Council also stressed the need to underpin the security of supply in a spirit of solidarity between Member States by developing more effective crisis response mechanisms, on the basis of mutual cooperation and building on existing mechanisms. These mechanisms, which are already in operation, were created in particular by the Council Directive concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply</p>
<p>(2004/67/EC) and Decision 1364/2006, laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks. The Council would also like to mention, for example, the recent proposed amendment to Directive 2003/55/EC, concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, and Directive 2003/54/EC, concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity, and the respective regulations, tabled by the Commission. The Council gives high priority to the analysis of these proposals and expects the EP to deliver its opinion rapidly, thereby securing their swift approval.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0727"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed changes in exchange rates either in relation to the euro or in relation to the currencies of Member States that did not adopt the euro as their currency.</p>
<p>What the Euro Group did discuss at its session of 8 October were exchange rate developments in third countries, an issue in relation to which the Euro Group has made its position known:</p>
<p>Emerging economies with current account surpluses should allow their effective exchange rates to adjust –mainly in China;</p>
<p>It was noted that the US authorities have reaffirmed that a strong dollar is in their interest;</p>
<p>As regards the recovery of the Japanese economy, which appears to be sustainable, it is hoped that the markets bear that fact in mind.</p>
<p>In summary, the Euro Group reaffirmed that excessive volatility in foreign exchange markets is undesirable for economic growth, and that exchange rates should reflect the economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>In this respect it should also be remembered that in the same Communication the Euro Group once again stressed its appreciation at how the Euro Area has played its role in gradually reducing global imbalances.</p>
<p>In the recent meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the G7, we informed our partners in the G7 of the Euro Group’s position – including the view that China must allow an accelerated appreciation of its effective exchange rate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0728"></a>

The agreement is an important step towards consolidating the democratic process in the country. The EU, which signed the agreement with observer status, gave its support to the negotiations without intervening in the process, and participates as a facilitator in the ‘Support and Vigilance Committee’, which was set up through the agreement to ensure that the provisions it established are implemented. The EU will continue to support the reform of the electoral process in Chad with a view to the holding of free and fair elections by the end of 2009. The situation in Chad was also addressed in the conclusions of the Council of 15 and 16 October 2007.</p>
<p>The unanimous approval of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (07) on 25 September made it possible to create a multidimensional United Nations presence in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic, including an EU military operation. On 15 October 2007 the Council approved a common action relating to the European Union military operation in the Republic of Chad and in the Central African Republic, under the name EUFOR Chad/CAF. This operation will be carried out within the framework of European Security and Defence Policy with a view to helping to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, to facilitate humanitarian aid, to contribute to the creation of conditions for displaced people to return voluntarily to their places of origin, and to help to guarantee the security and freedom of movement of UN and associated personnel. It must be stressed that the deployment of this mission falls within the broader framework of EU involvement in resolving the regional implications of the crisis in Sudan.</p>
<p>Various EU countries have informally indicated that they intend to contribute troops to the operation, i.e. France, Ireland, Poland, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Greece and Finland. The normal process of establishing the force will be initiated in due course.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0730"></a>

<p>The Council has always said that investing more in research, development and innovation projects is vital for achieving the goals fixed under the Lisbon Strategy and eliminating the gap between the European Union and its principal global competitors.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the 7th Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (2007-2013), the funding of which was substantially increased compared to the previous programme, various initiatives were launched to improve the coordination of research activities and programmes. These include the European Technology Platforms, by means of which industry and other interested parties develop common long-term perspectives and strategic research agendas in areas of interest to companies, and the ‘bottom-up’ ERA-Net scheme, which supports the coordination of national and regional programmes.</p>
<p>The Council is now in particular seeking rapid agreement on the approval of the first four regulations on the joint technology initiatives: ARTEMIS (embedded computing systems), IMI (innovative medicines initiatives), Clean Sky (aeronautics and air transport), and ENIAC (nanoelectric technologies). The Council also invited the Commission to present, as soon as possible, the remaining joint technology initiatives defined in the specific programme ‘Cooperation’ implementing the 7th Framework Programme for research, and reiterated the importance of open and transparent management of such initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0734"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council of 18 June 2007 reiterated its view that the comprehensive proposal of the United Nations Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, provided the basis for the settlement of the Kosovo issue by a new United Nations Security Council resolution. It underlined the necessity of rapidly finding a solution to the Kosovo status issue, which was essential as a basis for a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the rule of law, as well as for maintaining and reinforcing regional stability. The Council also underlined that the EU stood ready to play a significant role in the implementation of the definition of the status.</p>
<p>Due to an impasse on the issue in the United Nations Security Council, talks are currently suspended. In a statement on 1 August the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, welcomed the Contact Group’s initiative to hold fresh talks between Pristina and Belgrade, led by a Troika representing the EU, the Russian Federation and the United States. The United Nations Secretary General asked the Contact Group to report to him by 10 December. On 29 July Secretary General/High Representative Javier Solana appointed Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger as the EU's representative on the Troika.</p>
<p>The Troika began work in August and has met the parties several times since, in a constructive atmosphere. The first round of direct talks between the Pristina and Belgrade delegations took place in New York on 28 September. On 14 and 22 October, two more rounds of direct and indirect talks took place. The parties have so far maintained their diametrically opposed positions on the Kosovo status issue. Further rounds of negotiations with the parties will be held in November.</p>
<p>The Council of 15 October 2007 expressed its full support to the Troika process and to the EU’s representative, Ambassador Ischinger. It welcomed the intense pace and constructive atmosphere of the first rounds of talks. Noting that the Troika process will be concluded with submission of the Contact Group’s report to the UNSG by 10 December, the Council urged the two parties to engage fully in the remaining rounds of talks and to respond constructively, courageously and with a spirit of compromise, and to make every effort to secure a negotiated settlement of the status of Kosovo.</p>
<p>After concluding the Troika process, the United Nations Secretary General will present a report on its results to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>At present it would be premature to anticipate the results of these processes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0736"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern regarding the constant decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU and at global level, and agrees that efforts to halt this tendency must be coordinated and intensified as a matter of urgency, given in particular the short time-span that remains to comply with the 2010 commitments. As the honourable Member knows, in 2001 the Gothenburg European Council established the objective of halting the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2010. The EU also adopted the global objective of reducing the percentage loss of biodiversity by 2010.</p>
<p>At Community level, legislation on the protection of nature has traditionally remained at the centre of environmental policy, with the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC of the Council<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) and the Birds Directive (Directive 79/409/EEC of the Council<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), together with the CITES Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of the Council<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) relating to the protection of species of wild fauna and flora. As the honourable Member will certainly be aware, environmental questions are currently subject to the procedure laid down under Article 251 of the EC Treaty, which means that the European Parliament is co-legislator. At the same time, protected natural areas cannot survive and develop in isolation. The Council therefore urged the Commission and Member States to further strengthen the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem services considerations into policies and programmes in other policy areas, and to use the opportunities provided for in agricultural, rural development, forestry and fisheries policies.</p>
<p>The protection of biodiversity occupies a primary role in the Council’s political agenda. Last December the Council called for the Commission’s EU Action Plan to 2010 and Beyond to be implemented urgently. This Action Plan defines policy areas and the corresponding goals and supporting measures, which are reflected in specific targets and concrete measures.</p>
<p>The Council has continuously highlighted the need to safeguard the most important habitats and species and has called upon the Commission to begin a scientific analysis of species and subsequently of the habitats listed in the annexes to the Habitats Directive. The examination of Member States’ reports under the Habitats Directive may also indicate whether the protection status of particular species needs to be revised. The honourable Member is advised to consult the Commission directly for further information on this process.</p>
<p>At global level the EU is a driving force in the protection of biodiversity and is doing its utmost to apply multilateral environment agreements (MEAs), such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Convention on Migrating Species (CMS). EU countries adopted a primary role at the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES (CoP 14), in June 2007, organised by the Netherlands in the Hague. The Council has now initiated the preparatory work for the 9th meeting of the Conference of Parties (CdP 9) to the CBD, to be held in Bonn in May 2008, to ensure that the EU plays an active and constructive role. In addition to this, through the CMS, EU countries are also taking part in a meeting in Scotland with representatives of Africa, Europe and Asia (from 22 to 25 October 2007) to promote the creation of a new potential agreement for the conservation of migrating birds of prey.</p>
<p>Finally, Portugal is to host an important conference of interested parties on business and biodiversity in Lisbon on 12-13 November 2007, in cooperation with the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The objective is to establish partnerships with businesses to preserve biodiversity, which is also important for mobilising new and innovative sources of funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council noted with concern the Croatian Parliament’s decision to begin to apply the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone on 1 January 2008. This decision runs counter to the Conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004, in which the Council noted the Croatian decision not to apply to EU Member States any aspect of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, and welcomed the agreement reached by Italy, Slovenia and Croatia at the Trilateral meeting in Brussels on 4 June 2004. The Negotiating Framework also requires Croatia to take full account of the Conclusions of 17 and 18 June 2004.</p>
<p>Meetings between the interested parties to reach a satisfactory solution have not been fruitful. The EU has repeatedly stressed to Croatia, such as in the most recent meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 1 and 2 October 2007 in Brussels, for example, the potential consequences for the accession negotiations of its unilateral application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to monitor this issue closely and reminds all the appropriate levels of the Conclusions of the European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0741"></a>

<p>Following the request of the European Council, which on 21/22 June 2007 reaffirmed the value of Galileo as a key project of the European Union, on 1/2 October 2007 the Council adopted conclusions in which it undertakes to reach an integrated decision on the implementation of the European GNSS programmes before the end of the year.

<p>The Council never discusses allegations in the press.</p>
<p>The Council's position on most of these issues was set out in the conclusions of the Council of December 2006: ‘The EU remains firmly committed to the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment. It guides our own actions and we raise our concerns with third countries. In this context, the Council reiterates that human rights, refugee law and international humanitarian law have to be respected and maintained when combating terrorism. The Council will continue to follow closely developments with regard to human rights in combating terrorism and take adequate measures for their protection. The existence of secret detention facilities where detained persons are kept in a legal vacuum is not in conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law.’</p>
<p>In addition to this, EU guidelines on torture establish that the EU shall urge third countries to take the following measures in particular:</p>
<p>–	‘ensure that statements obtained through torture and ill-treatment shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made; (…)</p>
<p>–	ensure that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, including a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture or ill-treatment;</p>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council maintains that the primary goal of European policy towards Burma /Myanmar involves a peaceful transition to a legitimate civilian government. The EU continues to maintain a balanced policy, reinforcing restrictive measures on the one hand, and increasing assistance to the people of Burma/Myanmar on the other.</p>
<p>As regards the democratic process in the country, the Council refers principally to political and diplomatic instruments to accelerate that change. The EU Heads of Mission recently took two initiatives with the Burmese Government. The Presidency, the High Representative and the Foreign Affairs Commissioner issued a series of declarations urging the authorities to exercise restraint, to release political prisoners and to begin an inclusive dialogue with the parties involved. The Council also expressed its readiness to assist Burma/Myanmar in its process of transition, should the Government in fact decide to follow that route.</p>
<p>At ambassadorial level the EU troika has taken initiatives in various capitals in the region. The Council remains in close and regular contact with its partners in the region, i.e. India, China and ASEAN member countries.</p>
<p>In the ministerial session of 15 October, the Council unequivocally supported the good offices mission of the UN special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, and backed other UN initiatives, including by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed to reinforce a series of restrictive measures against the Burma/Myanmar regime without harming the population, which is already a victim of pressure. The EU stands ready to review, amend or reinforce such measures in the light of developments on the ground and the results of the mission of Ibrahim Gambari.</p>
<p>As regards humanitarian aid, the EU is among the largest providers of aid to Burma/Myanmar. The European Commission and Member States remain unanimous in their intention to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma/Myanmar, and to Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries. The Commission is currently working towards reinforcing that assistance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0772"></a>

<p>The limited nature of EU sanctions against Burma is lamentable. The impact of the ban on arms sales has been minimal, as has the impact of the visa ban, which has been breached several times. The impact of an asset freeze has also been only nominal. The total assets frozen Europe-wide could be just £57. The withdrawal of trade privileges is a welcome move, but the EU has still been one of Burma’s biggest investors and trading partners. Given that discussions regarding the extension of restrictive EU measures against Burma are presently under way, can the Council commit to banning all European companies and citizens from investing in Burma? Can the Council adopt a ban on the import of goods and services from enterprises owned by the military, military personnel and their associates? Can the Council commit to banning the import of strategically important goods such as gems and timber? Can the Council commit to banning international financial transactions from the EU?</p>
<p>Can the Council push for UN Security Council mandatory sanctions against Burma? Together with the UN, can the Council agree to the imposition of targeted sanctions, including a mandatory arms embargo, an investment ban and a ban on Burmese exports of strategically important goods, including gas, oil, gems and timber, until there is irreversible progress toward political transition, or until a democratically elected government in Burma requests that they be lifted?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(PT) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the October 2007 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU has maintained an arms embargo against Burma/Myanmar since 1990 and a comprehensive range of independent sanctions since 1996. The restrictive measures have gradually been reinforced and periodically updated since then. The sanctions are aimed at the military regime, people who benefit most from its poor governance and all those who actively frustrate the process of national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>The restrictive measures now include visa restrictions, a freezing of assets and economic resources covering some 386 people: SPDC (State Peace and Development Council), Regional Commanders and Deputy Regional Commanders, ministers, general military officers (from Brigadier), officials responsible for managing prisons and the police, people who benefit from the Government's economic policy and managers of companies belonging to members of the armed forces and their families; prohibition of the award of loans/credits and of participation in Burmese public companies, covering 41 companies or organisations, an arms embargo and ban on exports of equipment for internal repression; the suspension of non-humanitarian aid programmes (with exceptions in key areas such as health, education and poverty reduction); diplomatic measures, which include the suspension of high-level visits to Burma/Myanmar and the withdrawal of military attachés from the embassies of EU Member States.</p>
<p>Following on from the strong condemnation of the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in Burma/Myanmar at the end of September and the repression plaguing the country, on 15 October the Council decided to increase direct pressure on the regime through stronger measures and additional restrictive measures on exports, imports and investments in the sectors of logs and timber and mining of metals, minerals and precious and semi-precious stones. The EU also backs further active UN engagement, including by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Council recalls that it has used a wide range of tools to help to improve the situation in Burma/Myanmar, which included full support to the good offices mission of United Nations Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari and political dialogue with Burma’s neighbouring countries. Expressing solidarity with the people of Burma/Myanmar, substantial humanitarian aid has also been provided to the most vulnerable populations of Burma/Myanmar and to Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0765"></a>

<p>My attention has recently been drawn to a problem affecting workers form a Member State, namely Spain, and more precisely individuals from my own region, Galicia, which shares a frontier with Portugal.

As a result, the authorities take action against these citizens, imposing fines, confiscating the vehicle documents and impounding the car, leaving the citizen with two options: either to register the car or to deport it.</p>
<p>We have been told that the Spanish and Portuguese authorities are looking at this issue, thanks to protests made by some of those who have been affected.

<p>Concern is now arising over the movement Spanish-registered vehicles in Portugal, especially with respect to workers resident in the border zones who travel daily to the next-door country in order to perform paid employment.</p>
<p>Those most affected are Galician workers employed in northern Portugal, especially in the health services. Under Portuguese law, 'crossborder workers' are exempted from the general rules concerning the movement of foreign-registered vehicles in national territory; however, this concept has not been properly defined, and, as a result, Spanish citizens employed in Portugal have been penalised in checks by the Portuguese police for being unable to prove that they meet the legal definition of 'crossborder workers'.</p>
<p>In the absence of a rigorous definition, the risk exists that the lack of clarity in applying these rules will lead to faulty interpretations liable to damage the good relations which we all wish to see between Portugal and Spain in the European context.</p>

<p>I am in a position to announce that the General State Budget for 2008, currently being discussed in the Portuguese Parliament, provides from 1 January 2008 for cross-border workers to be able to travel in Portugal with vehicles registered in Spain, provided their place of work is up to 60 Km from the Portuguese border.</p>

<p>As the honourable Member knows, the Council and the European Parliament are examining the Commission proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community. This Directive will be approved by the codecision procedure, and therefore with Parliament’s full participation. The Council’s preparatory bodies are discussing the proposal in detail, and its technical, legal and political implications. Despite the results of the 36th General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Council is determined to move forward with a comprehensive approach to the reduction of aviation emissions which is consistent with EU policies and goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which includes intensive work on the Commission proposal to include aviation in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community.</p>
<p>The Council will also continue to work within the framework of the United Nations and bilaterally to involve third countries in efforts to achieve a post-2012 agreement on climate change. The EU believes that one of the key elements of the post-2012 negotiations is to correct emissions from international aviation in a more economical way, namely by widening and expanding the carbon market. The Council recognises the importance of involving third countries, particularly developing countries, and will continue to pursue efforts at diplomatic level to make it clear to the developing countries how the participation of airlines in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community can effectively bring net benefits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0686"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member is correct in pointing at the increasing number of irregularities reported. There were 80 irregularities from Basilicata in the year 2006 alone. Furthermore, 79 of these 80 irregularities were classified as suspected frauds by the Italian authorities and they involve a sum of about € 3.7 million. They represent about 11% of the number of irregularities reported by Italy. In terms of amounts, the proportion is much lower (1.6%).</p>
<p>Most of the cases reported concern the EAGGF - Guidance section.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Commission has been informed by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) that it has only one case in the follow-up stage relating to the Basilicata Region and no active investigations.</p>
<p>No requests were received from the Italian authorities for OLAF’s assistance in the carrying out of investigations in the Basilicata region in relation to the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Moreover, with regard to the programming period 2000-2006, the Basilicata Region reported to OLAF, via the central coordination point of the Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri – Dipartimento politiche comunitarie, a total of 93 irregularities.</p>
<p>The correct use of the Structural Funds is ensured by several actors at national and Community level. Audits on the use of Structural Funds are carried out both by national authorities and by the competent services of the Commission dealing with Structural Funds (Directorate-General for Regional Policy, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs). Each year the Commission receives a report from Italy (in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation 438/2001) related to their management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds. The report is discussed at the annual bilateral coordination meeting between the Italian authorities and the Commission. This year’s meeting will take place in December.</p>
<p>With regard to the EAGGF - Guidance Section, the Basilicata region was audited in 2004 in the framework of the 2000-2006 programming period. A further audit is planned for December 2007. Following the audit carried out by Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development in 2004 a financial corrections procedure is under way (in accordance with article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999).</p>
<p>With regard to the ERDF, the Basilicata region has not to date been audited in the framework of the programming period 2000-2006. The error rate detected by the national audit authorities is relatively low (0.18%).</p>
<p>In the framework of their annual strategy and audits planned, the audit departments of Directorate-General for Regional Policy (DG REGIO) will soon carry out a risk analysis (whose parameters are defined in advance).</p>
<p>As DG REGIO has moreover not received any information on possible irregularities, it is not possible at present to state whether the Operational Programme of the Basilicata region will be the subject of an audit in the near future.</p>
<p>In relation to the ESF, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the response given to his written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-4158_EN.html">E-4158/07</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also worthy of mention that the Italian authorities have earlier this month signed an agreement, which harmonises their procedures with those of other Member States in relation to the reporting of frauds and irregularities against the Community budget. This demonstrates the seriousness which the Italian authorities accord to the fight against fraud against the Community budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0747"></a>

<p>1. Business activities of Mr. Boomer:</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Boomer has been appointed as a Special Advisor to Vice-President Kallas with the general mandate of advising him in the area of buildings policy, of improving the relationships with the responsible authorities in Brussels and Luxembourg and of optimising the efficiency of the Commission's investments in this area.</p>
<p>Upon his appointment as Special Advisor to Commissioner Kallas for the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 and on the basis of the arrangements put in place by the Commission for the recruitment of such Advisors, Mr Boomer has informed the Commission about the other professional activities he continues to exert in addition to his mandate as Special Advisor to the Commissioner. He has given assurance to the Commission that these activities would in no way result in a conflict of interest with his tasks as special advisor.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any shares owned by Mr. Boomer or partnerships he might be involved in which might entail a conflict of interest with his current functions as Special Advisor.</p>
<p>2. Contradiction between the professional activities of Mr. Boomer and the declaration made by Vice-President Kallas at the CoCoBu meeting of 2 May 2007:</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is invited to refer to the information provided under point 1.</p>
<p>3. Access to confidential and relevant information by Mr. Boomer:</p>
<p>First of all, the Commission would like to underline that in developing its plans for the future concerning its real estate activities in Brussels it does rely on various sources of information and analysis. In this context the Special Advisor, taking into account his expertise in that field, is also invited to provide his opinion, which is one among others in a large forum. In his capacity, Mr. Boomer has been providing expertise in outlining the recently adopted Communication on buildings policy, which contains broad guidelines aimed to increase market transparency and strengthen competition among the various real estate operators. To the best of its knowledge, the Commission is not aware of any file whereby Mr. Boomer might have made use or abused of information given to him in his capacity as Special Advisor to Vice-President Kallas.</p>
<p>Should the Honourable Member know about issues that might be relevant and that have not so far been brought to the Commission attention, she is invited to communicate them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0705"></a>

<p>The Commission is closely following and analysing the situation. It fully understands public concern about the trade deficit of the EU. However, it needs to be put in perspective. The EU's trade deficit is mainly explained by the oil price, because regarding manufactured products, the EU trade balance is in surplus and, is continuously increasing reaching € 154 billion in 2006. Moreover, the available data for this year show that, cumulated over the first eight months of the year, the EU's total trade deficit (including oil) improved compared to 2006. However, the trade deficit with China is rapidly widening. As regards the euro area, the trade balance has even moved from deficit to surplus over the same period relative to 2006. Of course these are aggregate figures and the positions of individual member states may differ from one another, with some of them posting large surplus such as Germany, while others being in deficit such as Spain and France.</p>
<p>The EU remains a very successful trading block internationally for trade in manufactured goods with a stable world market share despite the rise of big emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil. In this respect, the EU clearly outperforms the United States (US) and Japan which are steadily loosing ground in terms of market shares.</p>
<p>However, this is an unstable equilibrium and the EU position may be at risk: the EU is already losing ground in high technology products while countries such as China are rapidly catching up. The geographic destination of European exports is also very important, and in this respect the EU has to focus its trade efforts on countries where demand is rapidly growing. Otherwise the EU would risk missing market opportunities in dynamic areas which account already for half of world import growth.</p>
<p>The right strategy is not protectionism but to keep markets open and seek actively further market opening from our partners. This is exactly the spirit of the Global Europe agenda designed to boost the EU's competitive performance at home and abroad. It implies a series of linked strategies on market access, trade defence instruments, protection of intellectual property rights, EU policy on China and a new generation of bilateral trade agreements to complement the EU’s commitment to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As such, it represents the external side of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the size of global current account imbalances and the risks they imply for global financial instability. The euro area took an active part in the discussions of the International Monetary Fund's multilateral consultation framework, where all participants supported a comprehensive strategy to reduce imbalances through policies that are in each individual country's own interest as well as desirable from a multilateral perspective. These policy plans include, inter alia, promoting national saving in the US and a gradual increase in China's exchange rate flexibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0709"></a>

<p>The EU is the first trading partner of the Western Balkans. Trade plays a fundamental role in the EU’s wider policy towards this region – the Stabilisation and Association process. Indeed, deeper trade relations with the EU, and within the region, are key for economic development and, in turn, political stability.</p>
<p>EU bilateral trade in goods with the Western Balkans has increased steadily since 2002. Total EU imports have grown by 7.2% annually and total EU exports by 1.8%.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 2007, EU trade with the Balkans increased more rapidly than with the rest of the world (+12.6% faster growth for imports and +5.2% faster growth for exports).</p>
<p>Turning to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, trade relations are conducted in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), that entered into force on 1st April 2004 and took over the provisions of the Interim Agreement which entered into force on 1st June 2001.</p>
<p>Since the entry into force of the Interim Agreement, bilateral trade with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has increased steadily, with our imports having almost doubled and our exports having increased by some 20%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission is very satisfied by the way our bilateral trade with the Western Balkans is developing, in particular with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0714"></a>

<p>The Commission still believes a Doha Development Agenda (DDA) deal is feasible. Negotiating texts tabled by Committee Chairs last July are pointing to a potential landing zone.</p>
<p>Negotiations are continuing in Geneva in view of issuing revised negotiating texts on agriculture and industrial products by November 2007, together with texts on services, rules and trade facilitation. On this basis, further negotiations should take place, including at Ministerial level in view of concluding a deal on modalities before the end of2007. But whether this will be the case, whether there will be a breakthrough, depends entirely on the negotiating engagement of the different players.</p>
<p>In economic terms, the remaining gaps are minimal; the problem is rather one of political will to do the heavy lifting and accept a compromise.</p>
<p>The challenge in the next few weeks is for negotiators to get to the specifics of the negotiations –rather than playing tactical games- and sign up to a deal.</p>
<p>We are now reaching a moment of truth on industrial goods negotiations, as we did previously on agriculture. Emerging economies are currently refusing to deliver their side of the bargain and make at best a modest contribution to the Round by opening, to some extent, their markets for industrial products, and are trying to turn the negotiations into a North/South showdown.</p>
<p>However, what is being asked from the about 30 emerging economies that would have to make a contribution to this Round can be considered as modest : to consolidate duties to the levels that are actually being applied; and for some countries and some sectors, make limited adjustments of 1 or 2% to the tariffs presently applied – over a period of ten years.</p>
<p>Rightly, the EU has said that it is ready to improve its agriculture offer if the other World Trade Organisation (WTO) Members also show flexibility and deliver their side of the bargain. Recently, the United States (US) announced it accepts the terms and ranges of figures contained in the text of the chair of the agriculture group, but this should by no means affect our stance.</p>
<p>For emerging economies now to refuse to make any contribution and ask for more flexibilities would do terrible injury to the current negotiating process, and drain the negotiations of their remaining momentum.</p>
<p>Moreover, such refusal would fly in the face of what we understand by Doha being "a development Round", as the consequences for developing countries would be a sharp reduction in new opportunities for them to trade amongst themselves.</p>
<p>With respect to the issue of domestic subsidies in agriculture, the US move to negotiate in the ranges of the Falconer modalities paper is an encouraging sign, although we have always been clear that at some point the US would have to become realistic on domestic support. While we already reformed our agricultural policy in 2003, the US is still lagging behind. Therefore, the US move is no reason for us to change course.</p>
<p>The EU will stand firm on this line, while continuing to reaching out to negotiating partners in a constructive manner, so as to create the necessary momentum for a broad deal on modalities by the end of this year. This deal should, in our view, not be limited to agriculture and industrial goods, but should provide a broad platform for the last stretch of negotiations on the overall agenda of the Round, including services, rules, geographical indications and trade facilitation.</p>
<p>It is indeed essential to have this deal on modalities this year. It is an illusion to think that the negotiations could simply be put in the freezer until the new US Administration is sworn in.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0735"></a>

<p>The EU and Brazil enjoy good trade relations, with increasing trade flows in both directions. Brazilian exports are becoming more diversified with the share of manufactured goods increasing. Furthermore, Brazil is a key player in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Development Agenda (DDA), playing a crucial role as the leader of the G-20 group. Brazil is also a member of Mercosur, with whom the EU is negotiating an Association Agreement on a region-to-region basis since the year 2000.</p>
<p>Brazil is a key partner and interlocutor for the EU pursuing some of the important challenges ahead of us; successfully concluding the DDA, managing globalisation, tackling climate change and reducing poverty.</p>
<p>The European Union is Brazil's first trading partner, accounting for 24 % of its exports and 21% of its imports. However, despite its economic size, Brazil only accounts for 1,8% of total EU trade, ranking only eleventh among EU trading partners.</p>
<p>The EU is the first investor in Brazil, with a European investment stock reaching € 80 billion. EU investments in Brazil alone exceed EU investments in Russia, India and China taken together. Brazilian foreign investments - although still at a low level - are increasing, the EU market being the first receiver.</p>
<p>The Commission strives to ensure that products in the EC market (imported or produced in the Community) comply with strict EU requirements and for this relies heavily on its inspection service.</p>
<p>The EU is the largest importer of agriculture products from Brazil. For this reason the Commission is monitoring very closely the sanitary conditions of the agri-products we import from Brazil. This monitoring includes an intensive programme of inspections carried out by the commission services on the spot, controls at imports and also random tests on the internal market at destination.</p>
<p>The results of these inspections indicate some shortcomings, in particular in the beef sector.</p>
<p>The latest inspection of the beef sector took place last March, and following its conclusion, the Commission informed the Brazilian authorities that we may have to reconsider the authorization of imports of beef if they have not provided, by the end of this year, auditable evidence of the rectification of all remaining deficiencies.</p>
<p>A further inspection by the Commission Inspection service (Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection (SANCO) Food and Veterinary Office (FVO)) will take place in November.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of Health and the Commission services responsible for Sanitary and PhytoSanitary (SPS) issues have provided to the Parliament comprehensive information of the sanitary situation of the Brazilian beef. The Commissioner was also present last 9 October in the Parliament's Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development where this issue was the subject of an intensive debate.</p>

<p>Replying to an earlier Question (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0671_EN.html">H-0671/07</a>)<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council said that the External Management Committee was analysing various possibilities with a view to responding to 'the concerns which are being voiced by a large number of Member States' with regard to the expiry of the so-called 'Memorandum of Understanding' on exports of certain textile and clothing products from China to the countries of the EU, on 31 December 2007.</p>
<p>As has been announced, the Commission is apparently going to propose introducing a 'double control' mechanism of imports from China - by both the customs authorities of the Member States and the Chinese authorities - for only eight of the ten categories covered in the 'Memorandum' and only to the end of 2008.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to avoid 2008 seeing a repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005 - an exponential increase in textile imports - and why is it not instead choosing to extend the restrictions in force and apply them to fresh categories, which would moreover resemble what is provided for in the agreements signed between China and the USA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After the expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) in 2005, in response to surging levels of textile imports from China, the Commission negotiated with China the Shanghai Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU introduced agreed growth levels for imports from China into the EU of ten product categories until the end of 2007. The MoU itself remains, however, valid until the end of 2008.</p>
<p>That was a once and for all deal with China based on the provisions of their WTO entry and gave an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new challenges posed by China as a major world player in the textile sector.</p>
<p>In the last months, the Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce discussed ways and means to ensure a smooth transition in 2008. In separate meetings with the EU industry and with the EU traders, the Commissioner responsible for Trade has conveyed the same message for a smooth transition in 2008. It is believed that a smooth transition is a matter of co-responsibility among all parties concerned and it is also in everybody's interest. Nobody wants a rerun of 2005.</p>
<p>Discussions with China were concluded in September 2007 and China is willing to co-operate with the Commission to put into place a joint monitoring mechanism for trade in eight textiles product categories for 2008 (cat 4 T-shirts, cat 5 pullovers, cat 6 trousers, cat 7 blouses, cat 20 bed linen, cat 26 dresses, cat 31 brassieres and cat 115 flax and ramie yarn). At the same time the Commission would not implement our internal rules in the form of single-checking surveillance on the remaining two categories (categories 2 cotton fabrics and 39 table and kitchen linen) under the MoU. By this joint surveillance, China has de facto accepted that it shares with us the responsibility to ensure a smooth transition after the expiry at the end of this year of the MoU agreed levels. The Commission will cooperate with its Chinese counterpart to this end.</p>
<p>The deal covers the economically important categories and those with particular sensitivities. The two categories not covered are those where the utilization of the agreed levels has been and remains lowest in the period 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p>Since early summer 2007, the Commission has also been in touch with Member States in meetings at different levels and with Parliament particularly via the numerous written and oral questions tabled by several MEPs. Some suggested that agreed levels should be extended; others that trade should now be fully liberalized; others still suggested putting a trade monitoring mechanism in place.</p>
<p>Between extension of the present system and full liberalization, which were both a non-starter, the road of double-checking surveillance was the EU choice. Particularly in view of the fact that other countries have reached different agreements with China in 2005, with different lifetime and with different coverage.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the deal of 2005 has proven useful and successful and it is now time to take the next step forward, the one to full liberalisation. In taking this step, experience suggests that it would be wise to monitor trade flows in the most sensitive categories at the same time. The double checking surveillance system described above just does that and it is part of the Commission's action to avoid a repeat of 2005. The co-responsibility of all parties concerned both in EU and in China is another aspect of the same effort.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that this is a good solution and notes Member States' broad support and favourable opinion. It is at the top end of what could be expected from the Chinese to agree to, and a double-checking system is both technically and politically preferable to unilateral EU action. Industry players – manufacturers and importers and retailers – have welcomed it.</p>
<p>As the next step, the Commission has published the corresponding regulation on 19 October 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission considers that the transition from education to a first job is crucial in promoting the inclusion of young people with disabilities in the world of work and in society generally. The Commission supports, and is closely following, implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Disability Forum and the European Youth Forum, which was signed on the European Day of People with Disabilities.</p>
<p>The European Action Plan on the situation of people with disabilities stresses how important it is that employment policy should integrate the issue of disability.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the European Employment Strategy, the Commission works in close cooperation with the Member States, whose task it is to implement the measures necessary for promoting employment of young people with disabilities. The Member States also have the option of setting national targets for employment of disabled people. The Commission has produced a guide based on its new Integrated Guidelines<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to help the Member States address disability-related issues more effectively in their National Reform Programmes.</p>
<p>The European Social Fund supports Member States’ efforts to promote active social and vocational integration of people with disabilities. As of this year, accessibility for disabled people will be one of the main criteria in the selection of operations to be financed. At the same time, the Commission is preparing a new regulation on state aid in order to simplify the rules on employment and training for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000, establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation,<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has been transposed into law in all the Member States. Its provisions on observance of the principle of equal treatment for people with disabilities stipulate that all employers have a duty to provide reasonable accommodation for disabled people. Article 7 of the Directive further stipulates that Member States may maintain or adopt specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to disability.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the conclusions of the 2006 Spring European Council identifying youth employment and the employment of disabled people as priorities. Lastly, the Commission Communication on ‘flexicurity’<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> offers new prospects for more effectively supporting the employment of young people with disabilities when they finish their studies (through part-time and temporary work, training placements and practical work experience, for example).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Wide differences in prices of payment services in Europe and the potential lack of competition in some markets are causes of concern for the Commission. For that reason, the Commission performed a sectoral inquiry regarding retail banking in Europe<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in the wider context of aiming at ensuring that full benefits of the internal market are delivered to the European consumers. In the final report of this sector inquiry, the Commission recommends a range of measures, including competition law enforcement and regulatory/self-regulatory measures in order to strengthen competition in retail banking. The identified weaknesses of the EU payments market are also addressed in the Payment Services Directive, adopted in April 2007 by the Parliament.</p>
<p>In general, markets for payment services in the EU Member States are still predominantly national. Furthermore, consumer behaviour and preferences strongly influence the strategies of banks, e.g. in Greece, the number of non-cash payment transactions per capita is by far the lowest in the EU. For these reasons, the Commission strongly supports the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, a banking industry initiative to create an integrated and more competitive market for euro payments which is planned to become fully operational by the end of 2010. At the same time the Payment Services Directive, due to be implemented by November 2009, is expected to generate more competition by removing market entry barriers and guaranteeing fair market access. It will also harmonise rules on information requirements and the rights and obligations of consumers in relation to payment services.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its work in the retail financial services area. As stated in the Green Paper on retail financial services, the Commission's objective is to bring concrete benefits to European consumers in terms of price and choice. Policy initiatives will be undertaken provided there is a strong economic case supporting them and consumer confidence and empowerment is improved as a result.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the results of the Commission's sector inquiry in the field of retail banking, the Commission is following up the issues identified in close cooperation with national competition authorities, within the European Competition Network (ECN). In particular, the Commission and the Greek competition authority are examining how to address the findings of the sector inquiry concerning Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that due to the increasing levels of alcohol consumption by young women, there is a considerable risk of neurological damage to foetuses. The Commission has addressed this issue in its Communication of 24 October 2006, which places the protection of the unborn child amongst the priority themes for action. As an example of good practice, the Communication refers to the fact that some Member States have introduced, or are planning to introduce, labelling on alcoholic drinks to protect pregnant women and the unborn child. With regard to such warning labels, the Commission will explore, in co-operation with Member States and stakeholders, the potential for developing efficient common approaches throughout the Community to provide adequate information.</p>
<p>Warning labels are however only one – albeit important – element within a range of measures that can improve information and raise awareness, and should therefore be part of a broader strategy. The Commission will therefore support Member States and stakeholders in their efforts to develop information and education programmes with regard to alcohol consumption and pregnancy. This will be done by combining the following two approaches:</p>
<p>- together with the relevant stakeholders the Commission will develop, within the framework of the European Alcohol and Health Forum, concrete actions aimed at protecting European citizens from the harmful use of alcohol. Parliament has been invited to participate as an observer in the Forum and can therefore follow its progress;</p>
<p>- within the new Committee on National Policy and Action (which is composed of Member States representatives), the Commission will explore the scope for the formulation of European objectives for curbing the incidence of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<p>This corresponds to a specific request made in Parliament's Resolution of 5 September 2007.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission will therefore not just use the Alcohol Forum in order to make sure that women receive information on the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy, but will also actively work with Member States to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0704"></a>

<p>The EU market is being penetrated to an ever-increasing extent by imported textile products dyed with azocolourants which pose a health risk and which do not meet the criteria laid down in Directive 2002/61/EC<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on azocolourants. It is paradoxical that strict conditions apply (for example) to work gloves made from leather and textiles but not to products which are in contact with a considerably greater area of the skin and for greater lengths of time, such as nightwear and bed linen. At present the period of time between the acquisition of textile samples and the publication of a warning in the Rapex system can exceed three-and-a-half months, which is long enough for a hazardous product to sell out completely on the market.</p>
<p>How can the period of time between the acquisition of samples and the publication of a warning in the Rapex system be cut to a minimum?</p>
<p>Would the Commission support the development of a portable device enabling products which probably contain banned azocolourants to be easily and quickly identified in advance?</p>

<p>Directive 2002/61/EC<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> sets an upper limit of 30 parts per million for aromatic amines released by azodyes in textile or leather articles which may come into direct and prolonged contact with the skin. The three types of article mentioned by the Honourable Member, i.e. nightwear, bed linen and work gloves are all subject to that limit and if it is exceeded, the textiles concerned must not be placed on the market in the EU. The limit was set as low as possible consistent with reliable measurement using the most sensitive techniques available. The restriction applies to those azodyes that are capable of releasing, by the chemical process of reductive cleavage, any of the 22 carinogenic aromatic amines listed in the Appendix given in Directive 2003/3/EC<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Since 31 December 2004, Member State competent authorities when enforcing the limit use the CEN<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> test methods given in Directive 2004/21/EC<a href="#defann_38_5" name="refann_38_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. The test method requires a chemical treatment of the textile to release aromatic amines from azodyes by reductive cleavage before their quantitative measurement by chromatography. The test requires about 1-2 man-days of work in a laboratory capable of performing this specific test. The commercial market for a portable device capable of carrying out sample extraction combined with accurate analysis in a quick and easy way extends far beyond the field of azodyes. Even if development of an instrument for such on-the-spot measurements was feasible, the financial incentive to develop such a device is already so large that additional Commission support to develop a device only for the detection of azodyes would seem to be superfluous.</p>
<p>By far the largest proportion of the average time from product sampling to the validation and publication of a notification on the RAPEX<a href="#defann_38_6" name="refann_38_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> system linking enforcement authorities in the Member States is due to the time taken by Member States to test, evaluate and report on sample products. This is the case in particular for chemical risks, where a visual analysis of a sample is not sufficient.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning, moreover, that RAPEX notifications concern restrictive measures taken by authorities or economic operators in relation to products posing risks for the health and safety of consumers. Therefore, the time for the adoption, publication and notification of these measures should also be factored in the calculation. Of course, in cases which present aspects of particular urgency (e.g. due to the level of risk, the scale, geographical size and political sensitivity of a recall), the time between sampling and publication in the RAPEX system, accompanied by information to authorities, the media and citizens, is compressed to a few days or even hours.</p>
<p>The Commission is regularly calling upon Member States to help improve the speed with which the RAPEX system operates, and working constantly with authorities to this end. In addition, at the next meeting of the Working Group responsible for Directive 2002/61/EC on azodyes, which is scheduled for 3 December 2007, the Commission will ask Member States to report on their level of market surveillance and on any difficulties experienced in enforcing the legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2000 the EU adopted legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin in the areas of employment, training, social protection, health care, education and access to goods, services and housing. It also adopted a legislative text prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of handicap, age, religion or belief, and sexual orientation. This directive is applicable only to employment and training. Some Member States, among them Belgium, go much further by prohibiting all discrimination, whether direct or indirect, particularly on the grounds of gender, age, sexual orientation, civil status, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future health, disability or social origin.</p>
<p>So that all European citizens may enjoy the same rights and protection, and as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, will the Commission propose extending the European anti-discrimination legislation on the basis of age, disability, religion or sexual orientation to areas other than employment?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is committed to ensuring that everyone in the European Union can fulfil their potential, without prejudice, racism or stereotypes being applied to them. The Commission welcomes the fact that a number of Member States have gone beyond the existing EU Directives based on Article 13 of the Treaty to provide protection against discrimination. However a study carried out for the Commission in late 2006 showed that, whilst most Member States provided for some form of protection against discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation, there was a variety between the Member States as to the degree and the nature of the protection.</p>
<p>In the light of these differences and of calls from the Parliament for action to complete the Community anti-discrimination framework, the Commission announced in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2008 that:</p>
<p>"As a follow-up measure to the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007), the Commission will extend and reinforce its equal opportunities policy. It will, in particular, propose new initiatives designed to prevent and combat discrimination outside the labour market – based on gender, religion, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation".</p>
<p>Work has already started on the impact assessment that is necessary for all major Commission initiatives, with a study commissioned to collect data on discrimination, and consultations of the general public, business, NGOs and the social partners.

<p>Policies dealing with accessibility issues, in particular accessibility to buildings, including hotels, are essentially the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Commission has supported work undertaken to improve such accessibility through a number of transnational projects<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These projects address notably the training of professionals in accessible design<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the inclusion of accessibility criteria in the public procurement process<a href="#defann_40_3" name="refann_40_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> or the development of tools for carrying out a detailed accessibility audit of buildings<a href="#defann_40_4" name="refann_40_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On the legislative side, Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, and prohibits discrimination on grounds of disability, age, religion and belief and sexual orientation in employment and training. Article 5 of this Directive requires employers to make "reasonable accommodation" for disabled employees. This Directive has been transposed by all the Member States, and if disabled persons are discriminated against in employment they have a legal remedy at national level. This Directive does not however apply outside the field of employment, occupation and training.</p>
<p>As announced in its Annual Policy Strategy for 2008<a href="#defann_40_5" name="refann_40_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> - and building on a study of existing anti-discrimination legislation in the Member States<a href="#defann_40_6" name="refann_40_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> - the Commission plans to propose measures designed to prevent and combat discrimination outside the labour market, inter alia on the basis of disability. An impact assessment is being undertaken as well as a public on-line consultation<a href="#defann_40_7" name="refann_40_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> which ended on 15 October 2007.</p>
<p>For what concerns specifically tourism, due to its limited competences, the Commission can not adopt legislation in this area. The Commission is however raising awareness on challenges such as the need to facilitate travel for seniors and persons with special needs.</p>
<p>For instance, the Commission has carried out a http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/services/tourism/studies_and_publications.htm" \l "INFORMATION_ACCESSIBILITY" . This Guidance describes how tourist facilities, large and small, and destinations as a whole can improve the quality of the service that they offer to disabled people and others who will benefit from better accessibility.</p>
<p>In support of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities for All” the Commission organised the conference http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/services/tourism/accessibility_conference2007.htm"  The main objectives of these conferences was to raise the awareness of all stakeholders about the impact and the business opportunities of the forthcoming process of demographic ageing that will simultaneously lead to a growing share of tourists with needs for more accessibility and higher service quality.</p>
<p>In the framework of the forthcoming Communication on an “Agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism” the Commission will continue its work to encourage the tourism industry to recognize that tourists with special needs form an important consumer group. It will further organize conferences and support the strengthening or the creation of platforms where lessons drawn by good and bad practices can be exchanged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The world trade union organisation ITUC has just published its annual report on the situation facing trade union activists around the world. The statistics are depressing, particularly in the case of Colombia. Of the 144 murders of trade union activists around the world, more than half - 78 - occurred in Colombia. Apart from the murders, a very large proportion of threats and other forms of persecution were also directed at trade union activists. Virtually all the murders in Colombia were committed by paramilitary groups close to the government or actually by the government's army.</p>
<p>The EU has previously ceased its trade cooperation with Belarus on account of human rights violations, etc. It recently did likewise in relation to Burma. At this very moment, the EU is negotiating a new free trade agreement with Colombia.</p>
<p>Peter Mandelson has previously, inter alia during a meeting at the European Parliament on 5 June 2007, stated that workers' rights are to be protected and that if any country were to violate ILO conventions, the Commissioner would respond vigorously.</p>
<p>In view of the above, will the Commission suspend the current trade negotiations between the EU and Colombia, or what will the Commission do to prevent human rights violations in that country?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It should be recognized that the administration of President Uribe has made significant efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the face of violence from drug traffickers, guerrillas and former paramilitaries. These efforts have been partially successful, even if the human rights situation in Colombia continues to be of high concern to the EU. The government of Colombia thus deserves our firm support.</p>
<p>Our support should of course be neither unconditional nor unquestioning. The EU regularly raises its concerns related to human rights in its political dialogue with the government. In this context, we have consistently urged Bogotá to step up its efforts to protect the most vulnerable population groups, such as trade unionists and representatives of victims’ associations. Any involvement of state forces in human rights violations is of particular concern. It is crucial that this be fully investigated, and the perpetrators punished.</p>
<p>Given the intrinsic linkage between drug production, trafficking and human rights violations, the creation of alternative sources for revenue and employment is a central plank of EU policy towards Colombia. This policy will be underpinned by the future association agreement between the EU and the countries of the Andean Community, which through further trade liberalization will create additional outlets for the legal Colombian economy. Moreover, the scope of the agreement will go far beyond free trade. The agreement will also allow for enhanced political dialogue and closer cooperation across the board – and thus create new channels and a reinforced institutional framework for bringing concerns related to human rights to the attention of the government.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is convinced that we can make a better contribution to the improvement of the human rights situation and better support those defending human rights by engaging Colombia in an Association Agreement rather than by suspending negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0716"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission points out that the Member States retain responsibility for child protection, children’s social inclusion and the management of childcare institutions.</p>
<p>However, in its reports prior to Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, the Commission closely followed the Bulgarian Government’s implementation of its policy of deinstitutionalisation and its efforts to improve institutional living conditions and develop alternative services such as fostering.</p>
<p>Relevant changes in Bulgarian law were introduced in September 2003.</p>
<p>The reforms focused on staff training, decentralisation of services, the introduction of cooperative arrangements involving local authorities and NGOs concerned with child protection, and the social integration of children living in institutions.</p>
<p>The situation of these children has generally improved since the new legislation came into force. For that reason the issue was not addressed in the benchmarking exercise pursuant to the Commission Decision of 13 December 2006 establishing a mechanism for cooperation and verification of progress in Bulgaria to address specific benchmarks in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages exchanges of good practice and policy coordination, under the Open Method of Coordination, in the field of social protection and social inclusion. The 2007 joint report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion shows that the Member States have responded to the request from the March 2006 European Council to take steps to eradicate child poverty and provide equal opportunities for all. In its evaluation of the Bulgarian strategic report on social protection and social inclusion, which is included in the 2007 joint report, the Commission has identified ongoing reform of the institutional long-term care system (ie of care delivered in an institutional setting) as a challenge for the Bulgarian authorities. The Commission will continue to follow developments in this field in preparation for the next round of national strategy reports covering the period 2009-2011.</p>
<p>Under the new 2007-2013 Financial Perspective for the Structural Funds, one of the main aims of the European Social Fund (ESF) is to promote social inclusion and equality of opportunity for all. The Bulgarian operational programme entitled ‘Human Resources Development’, being financed by the ESF in 2007-2013 and recently approved by the Commission, includes social inclusion and encouragement of the social economy among its priority themes, with specific aims including improvement of the quality of services delivered in institutions and further deinstitutionalisation.</p>

<p>Under French law, it is possible for municipalities and public establishments for cooperation between local authorities to pool their services in order to achieve economies of scale (Article L. 5211-4-1 II of the General Code governing Local and Regional Authorities).

This position is contrary to the thinking behind the Stability and Growth Pact adopted by the European Council, which applies to the Member States and their local authorities. The pooling of services complies with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact in avoiding the creation of departments with duplicate roles, which results in higher costs and the scattering of resources.

<p>In Sweden, VAT has been levied on books at a rate of 6% since 2002. The rate is the same for printed books and audio books. The text of printed books is reproduced identically in audio books.</p>
<p>The market for audio books is growing, and more and more people are using them nowadays. Audio books are of very special importance to the visually impaired and to people with reading and writing difficulties. The Commission now plans to bring infringement proceedings against Sweden to compel it to increase the rate of VAT on audio books.</p>
<p>Why is the Commission demanding that different rates of VAT be applied to printed books and to audio books, when the text is identical?</p>

<p>Under the current rules, Member States are required to apply a standard rate of value added tax (VAT) of at least 15% to all supplies of goods and services. They may however opt to apply one or two reduced rates to some or all of a list of goods and services set out in Annex III to the VAT Directive<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Annex III constitutes an exception to the general system established by the VAT Directive, according to which taxable operations must be taxed at the standard VAT rate, and must therefore be interpreted strictly.</p>
<p>Category 4 in this Annex concerns equipment for disabled persons and Category 6 concerns books.</p>
<p>While the protection and promotion of culture clearly is of fundamental interest, Member States still have to respect Community Law.</p>
<p>It appears that there are two categories of spoken books in Sweden, talking books (talböcker), which are exclusively for the use of disabled persons, and audio books (ljudböcker), which constitute what are generally considered as mainstream audio books.</p>
<p>In the Commission's view, audio books do not qualify for a reduced VAT rate as they cannot be considered as "books" (category 6) in the strict sense nor as "medical equipment" (category 4) for the exclusive personal use of the disabled.</p>
<p>However, the Commission launched a broad debate on the issue of reduced rates with its Communication of 5 July 2007<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

<p>The Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> imposes obligations on providers of international mobile roaming services to cap retail prices for making and receiving calls when roaming in the European Union. The Regulation also requires mobile operators to cap wholesale charges i.e. the prices that they charge each other, and to improve transparency by providing consumers with basic roaming pricing information, as well as more detailed pricing information at the consumer's request. The deadline for compliance with the full range of these obligations was 30 September 2007, although operators were required to comply with interim steps such as the obligation to offer a Eurotariff by the end of July 2007. The Regulation requires national regulatory authorities to monitor and supervise compliance with these obligations. Based on its own enquiries and on results of a further survey carried out by the European Regulators Group (ERG), which brings together the national regulatory authorities of the EU Member States, it appears that all operators have offered a compliant Eurotariff, and that a number of them, in various Member States, are offering Eurotariffs below the maximum levels allowed.</p>
<p>The Commission will report to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2008 on the functioning of the Regulation and will recommend, if appropriate, whether the Regulation should be extended in duration beyond the current expiry date of 30 June 2010, and/or whether it should be amended to include other services such as SMS or data. The Commission will also address other issues such as the impact on smaller operators, if any, of the Regulation, developments in charges for domestic mobile services, involuntary roaming and traffic steering.</p>
<p>More details on the ERG's monitoring and on the Eurotariffs available in Member States can be found on the Commission's roaming website at the following link:</p>

<p>Historically in the EU, methamphetamine use has been very low, mostly concentrated in the Czech Republic (sold as Pervetin) and to some extent in the Slovak Republic. Recent estimates of methamphetamine use problem are reported by these two countries. In the Czech Republic, it is estimated that there are between 18.400-24.000 methamphetamine users (2.5-3.2 cases per 1000 adults aged 15-64 years old). In the Slovak Republic, the estimates are 6.000-14.000 users (1.5-3.7 cases per 1000 adults aged 15-64 years old). Some reports of increased use among subpopulations in Hungary have been received.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data on drug use as well as treatment demand indicators suggest that there is no significant methamphetamine use in other EU countries. Where methamphetamine is used in other EU countries, it mostly concerns a small proportion of overall amphetamine use. In the EU, the use of Amphetamine Type Stimulants including methamphetamine has overall stabilised and is showing decline in an increasing number of countries. Relatively high levels of methamphetamine including Crystal Meth / Ice have been reported for many years already from countries outside the EU, including the United States, the Far East and Australia.</p>
<p>Concerning the effects of this substance, methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that causes hypertension and tachycardia with feelings of increased confidence, sociability and energy. It is closely related to amphetamine.</p>
<p>Crystal Methamphetamine is a crystallised form of methamphetamine and has a higher purity. Crystal Meth can be smoked (e.g. heated on a piece of aluminium paper) but also injected as it is easy soluble in water.</p>
<p>There are no indications that there is an increasing trend in the use or production of (Crystal) methamphetamines in the European Union. Reports from increased availability of Crystal Meth in some Member States have not been substantiated by evidence: the number of seizures of methamphetamine remains a fraction of that of amphetamines and have so for several years.</p>
<p>When methamphetamine is smoked, it reaches the brain much more quickly than when it is snorted or injected. As such it has a serious addiction potential.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine dependence may cause:</p>
<p>Mental health problems (agitation, decreased motivation, depression and anxiety, psychosis, worsening symptoms of schizophrenia, decreased concentration and memory);</p>
<p>Physical health problems (disturbed sleep, weight loss due to poor appetite, palpitations and chest pains and injection related problems such as abscesses);</p>
<p>Injection risk behaviour (Hepatitis C infections and other blood-borne diseases due to sharing of needles, etc.);</p>
<p>Social and financial problems.</p>
<p>Due to the higher purity of methamphetamine in Crystal Meth and 'base' methamphetamine, these types of methamphetamine have a higher potential to develop health and social problems than 'regular' forms of the substance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0737"></a>

<p>Regulation 1922/2006 establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality was adopted on 20 December 2006<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is committed to having the Institute operational as soon as possible. Since adoption of the Regulation progress can be reported as regards the appointment of the Director, the establishment of the Management Board and the preparation of the seat.</p>
<p>As regard the appointment of the Director, the Commission published on 27 April 2007 the vacancy for the post of the Director. In accordance with the Regulation, the Commission is currently in the process of establishing a shortlist of candidates. The Director will be appointed by the Management Board on the basis of the list proposed by the Commission. Before being appointed, the candidate selected by the Management Board will have to make a declaration before the competent committees of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>As regards the Management Board, the 18 representatives of the Member States have been nominated by a Decision of the Council on 30 May 2007 whilst the Commission nominated its representative and alternate on 30 April 2007.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Management Board was held in Brussels on 8 October 2007. It elected as Chair: Mrs Eva WELSKOP-DEFFA, Head of the Equal Opportunities Department in the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Germany), and as Vice-Chair Mr Michel PASTEEL, Director of the Institute for Equality of Women and Men (Belgium).</p>
<p>The Management Board will take the decisions necessary for the operation of the Institute. In particular, it shall adopt the annual work programme and the medium term work programme, on the basis of a draft drawn up by the Director, after consultation with the Commission. According to the Regulation, the first annual work programme shall be adopted not later than nine months after the appointment of the Director. In the absence of the Director, it is therefore not possible yet for the Institute to supply the work programme referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Commission is cooperating with the Lithuanian authorities in order to find suitable premises for the Institute. The Commission went on a preliminary and technical visit to Vilnius on 4 May 2007. Discussions with the relevant authorities are still on-going. The Commission underlines that it will be up to the Institute, being an independent body, to take the final decision on the premises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The one guiding principle for all the Commission's actions in this area is that there can be, and will be, no compromise on consumer safety. The law is clear: only safe products can be marketed and unsafe products are banned.</p>
<p>The Commission undertakes various concrete steps, both at the European and international level, to effectively address concerns about the safety of products imported to the EU from China or from any other third country.</p>
<p>The Commission has decided to start cooperation with the Chinese government under a Memorandum of Understanding since 2006.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the Chinese authorities receive detailed information about unsafe Chinese products found on the EU market and they have committed themselves to investigate each and every case and make the necessary interventions and improvements to their system. Detailed reports on prevention and follow-up actions need to be submitted to the Commission on quarterly basis. The latest report is from the end of September 2007 and its detailed analysis is underway.</p>
<p>In this context, still in October 2007, Commission product safety experts are going to Beijing to discuss with their Chinese counterparts this report and, more widely, possible ways of improving market surveillance over dangerous products of Chinese origin.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the existing consumer product safety regime works well to address the current problems. The conclusions of the current stocktaking will later in 2007 give the answer to the question what further measures might be needed at the Commission or Member States' level.</p>
<p>Customs have a major role to play in the fight against counterfeit and piracy. Seizures of fake goods entering the EU went up dramatically in 2006. To an extent, this reflects increased activity by customs in this area, as well as the success of pursuing a risk management-based policy of customs control.</p>
<p>The Commission is working closely with the Member States' customs administrations to further develop the protection offered by customs against counterfeit and piracy at the external border and to strengthen administrative cooperation with third countries, including China.</p>
<p>The Commission also very closely watches developments on the Chinese side and expects to see concrete measures taken. The EU-China summit at the end of November is the ideal opportunity to take this question up at the highest level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0746"></a>

<p>(FR) With regard to the Galileo programme, the Commission fully shares the view expressed by the European Parliament in its resolution<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 20 June 2007, particularly in relation to full financing of the Galileo programme from the EU budget and the need for a reimbursement mechanism for public financial contributions in the event of public-private partnerships being formed.</p>
<p>On 19 September 2007 the Commission adopted a package of texts including, on the one hand, a Commission communication<a href="#defann_55_2" name="refann_55_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and a more detailed Commission services working document<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and, on the other, an amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council,<a href="#defann_55_4" name="refann_55_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> to ensure the continuation of the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) programmes, and a proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework.<a href="#defann_55_5" name="refann_55_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> These proposals reflect a thorough study of all the possible solutions. They aim to secure financing for the Galileo and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) programmes in the period 2007-2013 and they respond to the calls made by Parliament in the above-mentioned resolution of 20 June 2007.</p>
<p>In their role as joint legislators and budgetary authority, Parliament and the Council will now have to examine the texts at the earliest possible opportunity so that a decision on financing the two programmes can be taken before the end of 2007.</p>
<p>Regarding the Quaero programme, this is a French research and innovation project in the area of advanced audiovisual search involving several industrial and research actors, supported by the French Agency for Industrial Innovation. Quaero is not an EU funded project nor is it organised under the aegis of the Commission. It was selected as one of 5 priority Research &amp; Development technology innovation domains by President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Originally announced as a Franco–German initiative in 2005, the project subsequently developed into two different projects proposed by two separate research consortiums led by French and German partners, the Quaero and Theseus projects respectively. Quaero involves public funding from the French government and has recently been notified to the Commission for its assessment under state aid legislation. The French consortium is now waiting for the Commission decision. Theseus is supported by the German Authorities and was authorised by the Commission under state aid rules in July 2007.</p>
<p>Investments in new information technologies are an essential element of the Lisbon agenda and will make a significant contribution to economic growth and employment in Europe. The Commission welcomes initiatives such as Quaero as long as state aid rules are respected. The public support must not adversely distort competition to an extent contrary to the common interest. In the case of Theseus, the Commission did find that the positive effects of the programme outweigh the distortive effects on competition. In addition, the Commission is, on its side, supporting directly, in the framework of its research programmes, several projects in the area of audiovisual content search involving many other research teams across the EU. The Commission intends to continue supporting R&amp;D on Multimedia Search Engines in future Calls of the 7th Framework Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Ever greater globalisation is causing huge social, political, economic and cultural changes. The winners at globalisation are economically powerful and culturally dominant nations. Weaker and less populous nations are gradually losing their sovereignty and national identity. One worrying phenomenon is the dying-out of languages, which are the basis of national culture. Of the roughly 7 000 languages currently used around the world, some 3 000 will die out over the next 100 years. Those disappearing the fastest are languages in Australia, the central part of South America, the south-east Pacific and Siberia. As the languages die out, so too does a wealth of knowledge, particularly in the fields of nature and medicine. The extinction of languages is also affecting Europe and the European Union. We should therefore take steps to protect and document languages. It is essential for a report on languages to be drawn up.

<p>This comprehensive approach is also reflected in the 2007-2013 programme for lifelong learning.

<p>A new American law requires all shipping containers to be screened and scanned for weapons, explosives etc. before they can be imported into the USA. This means that scanning equipment will have to be installed in many European ports, incurring considerable costs.</p>
<p>Has the Commission held discussions with the US authorities on this matter?</p>
<p>How does the Commission feel about the fact that European ports, transport firms and ultimately the European consumer will be paying for the USA’s national security and its war on terror?</p>
<p>Will the Commission contest the validity of the method employed, namely of scanning all containers rather than focussing on the weak links in the transport chain?</p>
<p>Since this represents a distortion of competition for European undertakings, will the Commission raise the matter in the WTO, and if so, what negotiating position will it take?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the "Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007" signed by President Bush on 3 August 2007. Mandatory scanning of United States (US) -bound maritime containers is indeed a great concern for the European Community: it is unilateral, ineffective and costly and entails serious political and economic consequences. If implemented, this measure would prove extremely trade-disruptive both because of increased costs as well as entailed delays. This must be avoided by all means.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed strong opposition to this measure in several statements and contacts with US decision makers. The Commission will raise this serious issue at the upcoming meeting of the EU-US Policy Dialogue on Transport and Border Security (1 November 2007), the EC-US Transatlantic Economic Council (9 November 2007), as well as in other high level EC-US events.</p>
<p>The Commission will also address this problem in multilateral fora, including at the World Customs Organisation.</p>
<p>Already in the framework of the International Maritime Organization in the period running from 2005 and 2007 the US tried to favour new provisions in the "Facilitation Convention" and in the "International Ship and Port Facility Security Code" in order to put new security responsibilities on ship and port facility operators when containerised cargo was to be delivered to them from the inland supply chain whereas those operators had no possibilities to control what happens in the said supply chain. This has been successfully countered by the EU Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission understands and shares the US security concerns but does not want European ports and companies to have to pay for US national security. It will continue to work with the US Government to find a viable alternative for 100% scanning. The Commission is working closely with the US Customs and Border Protection to develop a joint project on "secure trade", based on mutual recognition of the respective security standards and a multi-layered risk-based approach, which is the right direction to increasing cargo security. The EU and the US have also identified the adoption of a roadmap on mutual recognition of trade partnership programmes (Authorised Economic Operator – EU) and (Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism – US) as a deliverable for the 9 November Transatlantic Economic Council meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure you that it will do its utmost to find a politically and practically viable solution. Active involvement by Parliament will be essential to achieve our objectives in this politically sensitive issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0757"></a>

<p>Adverse meteorological conditions have resulted in a disappointing 2007 harvest in the European Union. The EU grain crop is now estimated at about 255-260 million tonnes, which is below the long term average. Greece was particularly affected by heat waves and the crop in this Member State fell to 3,2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The Commission reacted to the developing tight situation on the cereals markets and the record price levels by proposing to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council to set at 0% the obligatory set-aside rate for autumn 2007 and spring 2008 sowings. After examination by Parliament according to a fast-track procedure, the decision was taken by the Council on 26 September. According to Commission estimates, the extra cereal output in the 2008 harvest coming out from this measure (more than 10 million tonnes) should mitigate the anticipated low level of ending stocks in June 2008.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural Development has announced the same day that she would propose to the College of Commissioners that the Commission would send to the Council a proposal for the total suspension of cereal import duties for the current marketing year.</p>
<p>These short-term measures should contribute to the alleviation of the tight feed market and to ease the pressure on livestock farming.</p>

For European consumers, who have enjoyed considerably lower prices thanks to the development of this concept, this would be extremely unfortunate. For Europe as a whole, it would likewise be deplorable if this type of trend were to be allowed to take root, in defiance of the spirit of the Services Directive and of Community policy.</p>

<p>The cost of biofuel production depends on the resource and on the conversion technology to be used. Current biofuels (bioethanol, ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), hydro-processed vegetable oil and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME, biodiesel)) are based on traditional agricultural crops which have been grown extensively in the EU and thus there has been no need to carry out dedicated research on their costs and on water consumption as these parameters are well known. Several studies have been undertaken to determine their impact on the environment and climate change. The greenhouse gas savings from these biofuels depends on a number of factors including the processing. The Commission in its biofuels progress report<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, came to the conclusion earlier this year that first-generation biofuels, produced in Europe using the most economically attractive production method, result, on a well-to-wheel basis, in greenhouse gas emissions 35-50% lower than those from the conventional fuels they replace.</p>
<p>"Second generation" biofuels, which are produced from solid biomass, are still in the development phase and are not yet commercially available within the EU. These biofuels are based on either wood or other biomass where the issue of water consumption is not critical. Several studies have been undertaken on the environmental performance of "second generation" biofuels. All have indicated that these will have a significantly better performance than "first generation" biofuels.</p>
<p>However, the production of biofuels based on agricultural crops may result in negative overall effect for the environment if produced in inappropriate ways. Therefore, the forthcoming legislative proposal on renewable energy will include measures to ensure that the biofuels used to fulfil EU targets meet minimum sustainability standards. In this way, the public will be reassured that all biofuels that receive support from Member States, and which count towards EU and national targets, are not harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>The Commission will write to the management authority for the ESF in Spain (UAFSE) asking for additional information on the report concerned and on the measures it considers necessary to remedy the irregularities detected by the regional Court of Auditors of Navarra. It will take care to ensure that requests for payment sent to the Commission do not include any irregular amounts and that appropriate financial adjustments will be made in respect of any irregular amounts that may already have been confirmed.</p>
<p>A copy of the report will be sent to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) so that it can evaluate the presumed irregularities and take what measures may be necessary to protect the European Communities’ financial interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The organisers of the Fortis Marathon Rotterdam to be held on 13 April 2008 are charging foreign participants considerably higher entry fees than Netherlands participants.</p>
<p>According to the organisers, the reason for this is higher costs for postage and information mailings. That cannot, however, account for the additional charges of up to tens of euros.</p>

<p>Within the scope of the EC Treaty any discrimination based on nationality is incompatible with Community law, in particular with Article 12 of the EC Treaty. The European Court of Justice also held that any differentiation with regards to the access to a service on the basis of the place of residence can be considered discriminatory as non-residents are in the majority of cases foreigners.<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, according to the European Court of Justice<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, advantageous rates for admission to tourist sites, granted by local or decentralised State authorities only to nationals and persons resident within the territory of those authorities may constitute a violation of Articles 12 and 49 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Court has also consistently held that the freedom to provide services, the right to which is laid down in Article 49 of the Treaty, includes the freedom for the recipients of services to go to another Member State in order to receive a service there.<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>These general principles are applicable also in the area of sport services. In the particular case under consideration, charging different fees to participants of the Rotterdam marathon whose place of residence is outside the Netherlands, can amount to discriminatory treatment and be incompatible with the Community law. However, until now the European Court of Justice has never had the opportunity to clarify whether private operators, applying different fees for access to sporting events, are also covered by Article 49 of the EC Treaty. According to the information available, the Rotterdam Marathon seems to be organized by private entities. Therefore, the Commission cannot undertake actions envisaged by Article 226 of the Treaty in the framework of the control of the application of the Community law, unless public authorities have been involved in the organization of this marathon.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the Services Directive, which should be transposed by Member States by 28 December 2009, will prohibit any discrimination with regards to the access to services, on the basis of nationality or place of residence of the recipient. This prohibition will apply not only to public authorities but also to private providers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A major problem has arisen in a number of industrial areas of Greece (for example Viotia and Evvia) concerning hexavalent chromium concentrations in drinking water as high as 15 µgr/lt.</p>
<p>The Greek Government, referring to Council Directive 98/83/EC<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Annex 1, Part B, Chemical Parameters) in which the ceiling value for chromium, irrespective of whether it is trivalent or hexavalent, is set at 50 µg/lt, maintains that the water in question is suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>According to international reference works, hexavalent chromium and its compounds are far more dangerous than those of trivalent chromium. For example, chromium trioxide (Cr03) or hexavalent chromium is an hydride of the extremely harmful chromic acid and is defined by Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 92/32/EEC<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, as a carcinogenic, mutagenic, oxidising, extremely toxic, corrosive, toxic for reproduction and dangerous for the environment.</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of the danger levels arising from hexavalent chromium in drinking water? Does it consider that separate ceiling limits should be established for concentrations of hexavalent chromium in drinking water?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The metal chromium occurs in three valences, of which hexavalent chromium is recognized as the most toxic. It can induce allergies and asthma symptoms, and its inhalation can cause irritations or even perforations of the nasal passages. It is known for its adverse toxicological effects and for its carcinogenicity, affecting in the first place the lungs. It has been classified by the International Agency on Research of Cancer (IARC) in class 1 (human carcinogen). However, this classification is only appropriate for exposure by inhalation.</p>
<p>Regarding oral exposure, by contrast, a long-term carcinogenic study reported in the Guidelines for Drinking Quality<a href="#defann_66_4" name="refann_66_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> of the World Health Organisation (WHO) did not show evidence for carcinogenicity. The available data on hexavalent chromium are limited however. Both the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency and WHO are awaiting the results of studies on hexavalent chromium within the US National Toxicology Program. These results were due in 2006, but have not been published yet.</p>
<p>The current Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_66_5" name="refann_66_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>parameter value for chromium (50 µg/l) is based upon the WHO Guidelines of 1992, and the WHO 2004 Guidelines did not introduce changes in relation to chromium. The available toxicological data do not support the derivation of a new value. In the light of the revision of the Directive, the Commission is however reconsidering the parameter list of the proposal for a new Drinking Water Directive. It is closely following the scientific studies being carried out at present and will consider whether or not to make new proposals depending on the toxicological data that would become available as a result.</p>
<p>Nevertheless and quite apart from the issue of the parameter value for chromium, the Commission is very concerned about the current state of pollution of the Asopos River by hexavalent chromium, which the question of the Honourable Member refers to. For this reason, the Commission has launched an investigation in order to examine whether the obligations arising from EC environmental legislation, i.e. (Directive 2006/11/CE on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment; Directive 80/68/CE on the protection of underground water; Directive 91/689/CE on the management of hazardous waste; Directive 98/83/CE on drinking water) have been complied with. The immediate aim of the Commission's action will be to ensure that the pollution of the Asopos River from dangerous substances be stopped so that the quality of drinking water for the neighbouring populations can be restored.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
