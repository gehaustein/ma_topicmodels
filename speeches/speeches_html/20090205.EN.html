<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, today we are discussing what is known as the ‘open declaration’. This is about transparency with regard to feed as the basis for healthy food for consumers, and it is about giving purchasers of compound feed an overview of what is supplied to them.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a long road but, if we adopt this Regulation today, I hope this brings matters to a successful conclusion, and I should like to thank the Commission, which has helped us a great deal with its constructive work on the issues. The Commission encountered absolute political will on the part of Parliament to push through this open declaration, and also experienced a stubborn but fair debate with the Council. We can be proud of the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a brief look at the history. We had the BSE crisis and, in 1997, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry issued its final report in which Parliament called for this open declaration. The Commission presented a proposal, which subsequently became Directive 2002/2/EC. In a compromise with the Council – this went through all the bodies – the Directive pushed through the open declaration, which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a ± 15% tolerance, and the exact composition had to be provided on request.</p>
<p class="contents">That was a directive rather than a regulation, and Member States implemented it only very hesitantly or not at all. The feed industry brought an action to the European Court of Justice, and the Court gave the following first-class confirmation: apart from the exact information, the legality of this Directive was not in dispute. We then took account of this judgment in a further procedure in Parliament, and have now brought matters to a conclusion in the form of this Regulation. I had the honour of being rapporteur each time and, throughout this long period, I enjoyed extremely intensive cooperation with the Commission that was based on trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have a result that has been fought for hard but fairly, and of which we can be proud. It is also apparent that it enjoys the support of the majority in this House and of the groups. There are no amendments, from which I conclude that this Regulation will indeed be adopted by a large majority. Therefore, we have a good Regulation that brings about the open declaration in three steps – you know what they are – firstly, the components in descending percentage order; secondly, the provision of information to feed businesses with a ± 15% tolerance – in this regard we have not laid down a reservation of intellectual property rights in this legislation, but rather referred to the general legislation – and thirdly, the provision of exact information to the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to point out that we have set up a register. No feeding or admixing of components will now take place in the European Union without such components being published, as they must be included in the register. This is important not only to the supervisory authorities but also to the public and to customers. From the point of view of the rapporteur, therefore, I can say that I am very satisfied with the result overall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has managed to steer discussions during the negotiations with great skill, and we are very grateful to him.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package maintains the high level of feed safety achieved in the EU. It strikes the right balance between consumer protection and intellectual property rights. It removes the burden of the pre-market authorisation procedure for bio-proteins, modernises the labelling of feed through proper information for the customer and places coregulation at the heart of legislative procedures. It improves market transparency through the notification system for new feed materials, facilitates innovation and competitiveness in the EU feed business and marks a concrete step against the misleading of feed users – be they farmers or pet owners.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the negotiations is the compromise package submitted for your vote, which amounts to simplification and modernisation of the current legal framework. The provisions concerning the so-called ‘open declaration’ allow for a more modern type of labelling. Feed materials incorporated into compound feed for food-producing animals will have to be labelled by weight, in descending order.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, the exact percentage of weight has to be indicated for highlighted feed materials, and in the case of voluntary labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the provision that certain information concerning compound feed can be transferred from the competent authorities to the purchasers on grounds of urgency improves the appropriate information to the user in cases such as feed contamination incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission makes the following declarations. First, in order to adapt Annex III on the tolerances for the compositional labelling of feed materials and compound feed to scientific and technical development, the Commission and its services envisage taking up examination of that Annex. In this context, the Commission will also consider certain feed materials with a moisture content in excess of 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, with regard to the labelling of additives, the Commission will study whether the principles of information through labelling of feed could also apply to the additives and premixtures authorised under the Regulation on additives for use in animal nutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission understands that any urgencies relating to human and animal health and the environment may include urgencies generated, among other things, by negligence, international fraud or criminal acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the approach taken to this report is a model for the parliamentary work in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s vote does not involve any amendments, as the work on this was technically very sound and encompassed the entire political spectrum. I believe that this result is one to be proud of. It is a balanced result that safeguards the interests of farmers as users of feed, feed manufacturers, and all other links in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">It improves transparency, and my group, in particular, sets great store by the setting up of a register in which the raw materials mixed into feed must be entered. Food scandals occur time and again and not even the new legislation will prevent this, as no European rules are designed to prevent criminal activity; but these rules will help ensure that, when these scandals do occur, it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it a good thing that manufacturers of feed may provide further information on a voluntary basis, and I consider it an excellent proposal that, if they provide such information, this must be scientifically proven. I am of the opinion that this new feed law significantly improves protection and that the decreasing order enables farmers to see the proportions of each feed component and what is the best feed for their animals, and to choose accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate my thanks to all those who contributed to making this such a good report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This work has allowed us to reach agreement at first reading and furthermore, has been an excellent running-in process for the codecision procedure that will be standard practice in our committee in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at present, legislation on the movement of raw materials for feed and compound feed for animals, including pets – a sector that represents some EUR 50 billion in trade at Community level – is regulated by several directives and some 50 amendments and implementing acts.</p>
<p class="contents">The simplification of the legislation and its harmonised application are the main objectives that will doubtless be achieved by this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has already debated the placing on the market of animal feed, back in 2006. We will all recall that we unanimously asked the European Commission, in future review, to endeavour to find a fair balance between the interests of farmers in obtaining detailed information on feed ingredients and the interests of the industry in ensuring sufficient protection of its know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise reached on the main sensitive points of the Commission’s proposal, the open declaration of raw materials and the creation of a Community list of raw materials, is a good reflection, in my opinion, of this balance. Proof of this is the welcome the compromise has received from all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, by means of the open declaration, the compromise protects the rights of purchasers to be informed and of manufacturers to retain ownership of their know-how by indicating that information should be provided without prejudice to the 2004 Directive on intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question, ladies and gentlemen, that in a relationship of trust between supplier and user, the formulae should be known, but it would not be logical to be obliged to give the recipe to the first client who came through the door. Many of us have drunk Coca-Cola for many years. Although we do not know its recipe, this does not mean that we doubt that the product’s characteristics are observed and that health standards are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice judgment previously mentioned strictly establishes that the obligation to inform customers of the exact composition of feed, if they so request, is not justified by a desired aim to protect health.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I must remind you that the competent authority will have access to the precise composition at all times and, as established in the compromise reached, any emergency related to human or animal health or the environment will mean that the purchasers will have access to precise information on the composition of the feed in question once the legitimate interests of both the manufacturers and the purchasers have been considered.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the list of good labelling practices, this remains voluntary for the professionals in the sector without at any time becoming a positive list of raw materials for the manufacture of compound feeds, as this is something that has not been requested.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation will include, at the European Parliament’s request, a new annex comprising a list of raw materials for animal feed of which the placing on the market or use is prohibited or restricted. This is information, whether an annex or a list, that the Commission can update.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, whom I represent, supports the compromise reached and has not tabled any amendments for the plenary. We are fully in favour of the position as presented today in this House and, as such, we will vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe shares the view that the compromise that has been struck is a good one, and so we will be able to vote in favour of it later today.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters most is for the intellectual property of the cattle feed manufacturers to be safeguarded. If we in the sector want innovation – as indeed, yesterday, we voted on a climate report – there is much room for improvement in the cattle feed sector too, so that the emission of all kinds of gases caused by livestock can be reduced. Well, this is a challenge we need to confront squarely. When cattle feed manufacturers decide to innovate, they should not be impeded by excessively strict legislation on disclosure. This disclosure is, to my mind, safeguarded, as others have already mentioned, and could be done at the request of the government or a certain customer, for example. There is nothing stopping the cattle feed manufacturers from doing this on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The ingredients as such are not the most important thing: the precise nutritional value of cattle feed is much more important, and should be correctly labelled. Everything that is on the label, such as energy, protein, and suchlike, is valuable information. In short, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will be backing this compromise. We will also say to the cattle feed manufacturers that if they wish to innovate in their production processes and their cattle feed composition, for example, this is a good compromise that will help them do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unpleasant experiences from the past in the form of animal diseases caused by unsuitable feedstuffs brought about huge material and social costs in the countries of the Community. This is why defining the composition of feeds is also extremely important, in order to limit the use of improper feeds. Effective enforcement of the provisions contained in the regulation is also important, so that they will not be merely hollow declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, when millions of people and even entire countries in Europe are against the consumption of food produced using animal feeds which contain genetically modified plants, those people have the right to know what is happening. Therefore, it is not only farmers who should be informed about the contents of animal feed, but food processing plants should inform customers about this on product labels. And this is not being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Several months ago in this Chamber, we debated the increasing numbers of obese people in Europe. This problem, however, in great measure concerns precisely the contents of animal feeds, because it is these contents which significantly affect the quality of meat. It is very good that in the draft regulation, much attention has been paid to the hygiene of feed production and to the problem of the addition of contaminated materials during production. That practice has sometimes been used by many producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has also displayed the wisdom of Solomon in striking a balance between the needs of the consumers and the very legitimate needs of manufacturers for the protection of their product and their intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I would call back home one of the more classic European Parliament dossiers. Looking at our guests in the visitors’ gallery, it is pretty safe to say that animal feed labelling is probably not one of the most glamorous subjects they could have heard us talking about today, but it is crucially important and it is a real example of where this Parliament adds value, and where we can ensure our consumers’, our citizens’ and our voters’ faith in the food chain of the food they eat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember where this issue came from. The BSE crisis proved that what we feed our animals needs to be regulated. This Regulation needs to be transparent, and there needs to be a balance struck between consumers’ needs and the needs of the manufacturers, but it can go wrong. It has gone wrong and we must ensure it does not go wrong again. This report is crucial in taking that forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had numerous meetings with the industry in Scotland, and with consumer groups and the farmers themselves, and there has been pretty well universal support and approval for the way that the Commission and Parliament have taken this forward, and particularly for our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">This dossier does add value. It is a good example of Parliament working. We often say that there has been good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. On this one, there really has been, and the fact that there are so few amendments being tabled to this report demonstrates that it will go through with a big majority. Parliament has had a good day today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The access of animal feed users to information about the contents of the feed will still be limited by the protection of intellectual property rights. If the producer of a feedstuff uses a dangerous ingredient, we will still be vulnerable. The problem of feedstuffs is further proof of the mistaken direction being taken by agricultural policy which, in spite of declarations, supports industrial agriculture first and foremost and, in such agriculture, farmers do not have to have their own feedstuffs and can raise animals using feedstuffs produced by specialised businesses. These businesses are, of course, profit-driven and will always find a way to reduce costs, but will not necessarily take into account the safety of animals or our health. As a consequence, we have to multiply specific provisions and increase monitoring, which takes the matter to an absurd level.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not time to reverse these tendencies and to return to the sustainable development of agriculture, in which farmers will have their own feedstuffs and will not be exposed to the losses caused by dioxins or BSE? Progress in agriculture does not have to mean the concentration of production or the concentration of feedstuff production. We should bear in mind that in the EU, we currently have 15 million farms, and as many as 95% of these are small and medium-sized farms. Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers, the environment and of us all. We only need to radically change our approach to agriculture, and in doing so to change our approach to current common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, we always mention jaw traps when talking about wild animals, and the question of transport, breeding and feed always arises in relation to farm animals. Animal feed is a classic case; it is a mishmash, a load of rubbish. Antibiotics, clenbuterol, growth hormones, even the remains of other animals, are used, and this is what the United Kingdom’s contaminated feed problem from the 1990s was all about.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today we are told that the junk-food era is over. There has been a 2002 directive and a 2005 Court of Justice ruling and, now, there is the desire to reconcile the market and profit – which is referred to as intellectual property – with consumer safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, here we find ourselves today armed with a regulation. Using the classic tool of labelling, all the components are going to be indicated, in descending order of weight, and there will also be an open declaration, an Annex III and a tolerance of +/-15%. Moreover, the most inquisitive among us will even be able to request the exact composition.</p>
<p class="contents">Only two big questions remain. The first concerns imported animals which have not been labelled. Mr Parish is here; he has taken a great interest in animals arriving from Brazil, which are not marked and which have been fed clenbuterol. When it comes to the safety of these animals, we do not know a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">And then there remains the big question of imported feed, namely raw materials that have been arriving from the American continent since the 1960s. In the 1960s, this came in the form of corn gluten feed – molasses, oilseed residues – and, today, it is in the form of transgenic soya from Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and transgenic maize from Canada and the United States. And this, dare I say it, because people are against local GMOs, but not immigrant GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, we are talking here about two-thirds of the feed of our herds, and that is a real health issue. The single issue of European health security is obscuring the wider issue of global health risks, due to the Uruguay Round agreement and the Blair House agreement, which oblige us to import our oilseeds to feed two-thirds of our herds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me say to the last two speakers and to the guests we have in the gallery: please eat your food safely this afternoon when you have your lunch, because, if we are to believe the last two speakers, there is nothing safe to eat anywhere as far as I can see!</p>
<p class="contents">The whole idea of this legislation is to bring safety to the food we eat, and, of course, what our animals eat is essential because we eat those animals. I know it is a very simplistic approach to take, but that is exactly why we are here.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have made mistakes over the years, and I would be the first to admit that the feeding of meat and bone meal back to cattle caused the BSE problem – which was not anybody’s finest hour – and that is why we are bringing this legislation forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole argument now is not about whether we should have transparency and have the ingredients on the label, because that is precisely what will be there. The manufacturers’ argument was to ask whether they had to put the precise percentages, because somebody could then turn round and copy that feed and make exactly the same feed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where the compromise and the work that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the Commission and Council have done is so good, because we have reached a situation now where we can really trust our feed. If you have looked recently at the problems that we have had in Europe – and we have had problems in various countries with animal feed – this is not because the labelling system and the processes have been wrong, but because companies have broken the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must ensure not only that we get this law right but also that the Commission and Member States monitor this law and inspect the feed companies to make sure that they are not breaking the rules, because, again, people and consumers must have confidence in our food.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to you that European food is as safe as we can get it, but we must never let up, to make sure that our consumers are absolutely satisfied that what they are eating is safe. I would say to our guests: please go and have a good lunch and be assured that it should be safe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Efforts at simplifying current legislation in the area of the marketing and use of feedstuffs and in the area of required and additional information placed on packaging and in freight documentation are a justified step.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certain that simplifying technical provisions and an enlargement of purely administrative provisions will have a beneficial effect on the growth of competitiveness of the EU feedstuffs sector and on food safety, which Mr Parish has just spoken about. I am certain that this assumption is itself justified.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw attention here to a question which may be problematic. I think that the obligation to label products with a freephone number placed on small and medium-sized producers of feedstuffs for domestic pets is unnecessary. Introduction of this provision may cause a financial burden which is too great for these small and medium-sized producers, and most feedstuff producers fall into these two categories.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I would like to stress that we must strive to simplify the entire system of legislation in the area of the marketing and use of feedstuffs. In so doing, care should be taken over safety. However, the introduction of controversial provisions which generate excessive costs may unfavourably affect precisely those small businesses which produce for local markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Food safety in the EU has been shaken by many crises in recent years, such as BSE and several dioxin scandals, the latest of which apparently occurred last autumn. The causes of the crises have often been found to be contaminated feed, due to negligence or even criminal activity. This regulation to simplify and clarify legislation is welcome. The regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the European food chain. Consumers need to be protected and they must be able to tell where and how the food they buy has been produced.</p>
<p class="contents">Another objective is the legal protection of farmers. They have to make choices on the basis of labelling, and they must be able to have faith in the impeccable quality of feed. The manufacturing rights of the producers of feed must also be safeguarded, as Mr Mulder said earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">In many Member States, things are well under control, but the regulation before us, which will make labelling clearer and make it easier to trace the origin of feed, is needed to ensure things are put right throughout the EU, and to end differences of opinion when it comes to interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation, and others, that there is proper implementation and monitoring. Clear and precise regulations will not help unless they are complied with in practice. When monitoring the quality of feed, it needs to be ascertained that it is safe and fit for purpose and that it meets the legal requirements. This way we can improve the safety of the entire food chain and protect consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Agricultural producers would never have been able to comply with complex health regulations, HACCP and traceability, and would therefore have been forced to purchase from real feed factories the foodstuffs that had been made on the farm for centuries. At the time, we managed to avoid this snare.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are debating today defines feed but not feed factories. So that Europe does not get the blame once again, it must be crystal clear that foodstuffs for livestock, mixed on the premises of the livestock company, does not constitute feed, but simply extemporaneous mixing of foodstuffs and raw materials produced directly in the fields, and that the agricultural business is not a feed factory. Perhaps it is a partisan position, but one can never be too careful when interpretations have considerable economic significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Providing maximum detail on the precise composition of feedstuffs is right and understandable, but we must not so undermine intellectual property rights as to make them meaningless. In that respect, I have some residual fears on aspects of these proposals. Compound mixes are trade secrets built up over years of research and trial. They must be adequately protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the 15% margin in description precision will be enough. I, for one, do not want to see feed mills in my constituency, which have worked hard and invested heavily in producing premium product, being gazumped and their intellectual property rights raided by manufacturers operating in cheaper production areas, either within or outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust this regulation will not be either misused or abused in that regard. Yes, farmers are entitled to maximum information on compound contents, but within the confines of preserving the viability and the future of the mills from which they buy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, public and animal health should be at the heart of cattle feed legislation. This translates into clear rules regarding the use and labelling of raw materials. This should, of course, remain workable and not lead to a greater administrative burden or, as has already been mentioned, jeopardise the manufacturers’ intellectual property. We will continue to monitor this with a critical eye, but it looks as if the new regulation will meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make an observation with regard to inspection. Once again, effective controls and sanctions to separate the wheat from the chaff will make or break this legislation. The regulation stipulates that the penalties which the Member States may apply themselves must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I would urge the European Commission to closely monitor the situation in the near future, to make sure this is the case in all the countries of the European Union. It is, after all, unacceptable for one country to be stricter than another. An excellent case in point is, to my mind, the suspended sentences that were given this week, ten years after the event, in the Belgian dioxin scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention a topic that cannot remain untouched, namely meat and bone meal. Following the emotional speech of the first speaker from the Non-Attached Members, I shall confine myself to the facts. Meat and bone meal in animal feed has been banned since the BSE crisis. However, in the case of chickens, for example, this leads to a shortage of animal protein in their feed, quite apart from the fair criticism that valuable proteins are destroyed. Moreover, animal feed is the largest overhead for the five million cattle farmers in the European Union who have not got it easy to begin with.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we do not want to revert back to a situation in which animal proteins from within the same species end up in the feed. Cannibalism: never again! We need to put tests in place in order to handle this situation properly. The European Commission has indicated that these tests could be available in 2009, which means that meat and bone meal could be reintroduced in the feed of chickens or pigs, for example, in a safe manner. I should like to find out from the European Commission what the latest is on this score and what steps we can expect in this respect in the coming year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For products of animal origin to be of good quality, good quality feedstuffs are essential – this is the most important factor – as well as suitable living conditions for the animals. Most of the ingredients of feedstuffs are produced by agriculture itself, but the additives which are used are most often chemical products. It is these which create the most controversy. Therefore, we should fight for the exact composition of industrial feedstuffs to be declared. It has nothing to do with intellectual property rights and their protection. Only when a patent office grants a protection certificate is a product protected.</p>
<p class="contents">When they have not been tested sufficiently, new animal feed additives may be harmful to our health, although they ensure the best growth or the best appearance of the product. A farmer does not have the facilities to test feedstuffs and can only rely on information supplied by the producer. We should remember BSE and the results of adding meat and bone meal to animal feeds. Industry will do everything for profit. This is why I support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also hope that the new rules will not increase costs for small and medium-sized producers of animal feed mixes.</p>
<p class="contents">When discussing the subject of labelling, it should be remembered that often the problem is not a lack of information on the product label, but a lack of understanding on the part of the ordinary consumer. Too much information on the label may actually hinder the buyer when making a choice. On the one hand, we must ensure that our citizens have access to information, while on the other, we must safeguard the intellectual property rights of producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the idea of drawing up a list of ingredients which may not be fed to animals. One thing is certain – we cannot allow a repeat of food-related scandals. Irish pork contaminated with dioxins or melanin in milk from China are examples of incidents which should not have happened. We ought to ask why the monitoring system did not function correctly and why the contamination arose.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of monitoring therefore requires greater supervision. Procedures must be transparent and unambiguous. Fines for not complying with the monitoring system or for breaching it should be high, because they are related to human health. In spite of the incident in Ireland, I would like to give my assurances that in Europe, farmers and producers maintain the highest standards in the world. Our food is characterised by its acknowledged reputation and quality. The food in Europe is safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only in this report but also over many years in the past, he has always followed a clear line, which aims to achieve what we have achieved today: creating clarity for farmers and setting out clear requirements in the field of placing feed on the market and the use thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing the second step, and this, in particular, has become clear time and again. Commissioner, yesterday evening, last night, we discussed the first step: production. I should like to return to this. The type of production and the type of controls on production are the most important prerequisites for this report, to ensure that ultimately, we have healthy, safe feed from which to produce healthy, safe food.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate my conviction that businesses that also process food to make feed should be subject to better scrutiny, that the HACCP concept should be required as a basis for authorisation – possibly for authorisation throughout Europe – as that has also been a problem in both yesterday’s and today’s debates. We need the same controls for the same risks throughout the European Union. Although we can never rule out abuses, this report and also yesterday’s debate have laid good foundations for safety without going over the top. This is another point made in today’s report, of course: that we have learned from developments following the BSE crisis, and that we now know that quite a few things can – and must – be done differently.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to reiterate my thanks to our rapporteur, who has produced a good report today out of all the negotiations here. I hope that he receives one hundred per cent support from this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the European Union, there are, in fact, 5 million farmers and 60 million pet-owning households.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, the European Union has come to terms with a number of health crises, which means that, today, we have to be more vigilant with regard to transparency, in order to meet the expectations not only of farmers, but also of consumers. The provisions laid down in this report have the advantage of representing a minimal cost for the industries and a great benefit for consumers, who are paying more and more attention to the quality of the goods they buy. Adopting this report will make it possible to limit the risks by guaranteeing better quality goods, better monitoring, more traceability, and better information for farmers and, therefore, ultimately, for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, with the increase in international trade, it is vitally important to strengthen all prevention systems, so as to ensure that the food crises that we have experienced in the past do not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">This report succeeds in reconciling the right to information, while strictly defining the nutritional elements that must appear on the labels, with the right to intellectual property, which is so important when it comes to preserving the competitiveness of our industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that manufacturers should actually be obliged to give immediate notification of the use of any new raw material going into animal feed, in order to guarantee transparency and to facilitate the inspections performed by the competent authorities. Including an urgency procedure that enables a new dangerous substance to be incorporated into the list of prohibited materials seems altogether crucial to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, giving farmers the opportunity to question the competent national authority or the European Commission in case of doubt about an unfair allegation enables the system to be controlled better and customers to be protected, while fair trading is also preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to offer my full support to this excellent report, for experience shows that a regulation on the labelling of animal feed that prioritises quality, transparency, traceability and monitoring is the best means of preventing further health crises in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We urgently need more investment in research, especially into ruminant feed to reduce the methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, is it not long past the time for reference points for action, or RPAs, for dealing with the adventitious presence of minuscule levels of GMO in feed, rather than the present zero-tolerance regime, which results in criminally disproportionate waste of feed and cereal shipments and criminally disproportionate sanctions? I refer, of course, to the presence of previously authorised GMs by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), so that they are fully risk-assessed by definition, or perhaps a GMO that is fully authorised in another jurisdiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to ask the two Commissioners present to insist on these European standards in the case of imports of feed and food as well in future. Europe can face up to global competition only if the same standards are applied to imports.

First of all, on the question of safety, safety of feed is guaranteed by the negative list of feed materials which cannot be used in feeds. The proposal contains the list of feed materials which are forbidden. The Commission will extend that list every time it is convinced that it is necessary to add to that negative list.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I wish to remind you that there is a large list of maximum levels of contaminants, such as dangerous micro-toxins, heavy metals and dioxins, which has been in force, under the Directive on undesirable substances, since 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I would agree with all those who said, as I confirmed, that European food is safe. However, as I also indicated last night during our discussions, laws and regulations are as good as we make them, and we therefore have to remain vigilant and see to it that Member States, feed dealers and, indeed, the Commission, ensure that everybody sticks to their obligations in ensuring that laws really are enforced and that they are good laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Irish meat incident highlights the need for stringent enforcement and controls on legal requirements, and my services will continue to examine how that can be improved. I am confident that, once the new rules come into force, regulation of the feed market will be significantly improved, in the interests of both feed manufacturers and users.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for his excellent contribution, and all Members for their constructive and positive role in reaching an agreement on this important initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this is a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of whether criminal activity can be prevented, this report cannot do so, of course, but the improved intensity of controls it provides may deter such activity. Criminal activity always focuses where it sees an opportunity, where it sees loopholes, and we have now been able to close these in some areas. I hope – as Mr Nicholson said – that both the feed industry and farmers will understand that there is something to be defended here, that a community is being formed against these attempts to dispose of toxic substances via feed. I am fairly sure that this will also curb criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make clear once more that we are not creating a separate line for intellectual property here, but rather making reference to the legislation already in force, which also applies to this field. We wanted to prevent the duty of information from hiding behind these intellectual property rights. That is why this is a good arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs. Here, too, there were arguments, of course – after all, we hold different opinions in this House – but I believe that what we subsequently created now has everyone’s support. I should also like to thank our committee’s administrative team – in this case Mr Emmes – who did outstanding groundwork. Although we Members of the European Parliament always play a leading role in the political field, in the administrative field we do need to be able to fall back on this groundwork. Here, too, this was very successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that, when we have codecision, parliamentarianism is fun. It was always said that codecision in agriculture would make everything much more complicated and time-consuming. This is not true, as we have seen that, given good work, a good understanding of matters, good groundwork and good political opponents, things can be staged very quickly. I think that this is proof that the expertise of the European Parliament can serve, and help, to set good legislation in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when the economies of our countries are suffering as a result of the global crisis and when increasing the demand for agricultural products is an imperative, amending Regulation No 3/2008 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries offers us additional leverage to support agricultural producers and, by extension, the EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">European Council Regulation No 3/2008, which combines in a single text regulations 2702/1999 and 2826/2000, has accommodated the European Commission’s new political approaches on simplifying legislation, while also achieving the objective of facilitating administrative procedures within the European institutions. Based on this regulation, the Community can take information provision measures for a certain number of agricultural products on the internal market and on the markets of third countries, while also preserving the specific nature of the measures, according to the market in which they are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy provides a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, especially the benefits in terms of quality, nutritional value and food safety standards, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries. It also helps open up new market outlets and has a multiplier effect for national and private sector initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments initiated by the European Commission are aimed at allowing interested Member States to devise a relevant programme where the organisations involved in drawing up proposals do not wish to present programmes to be implemented in third countries. As a result of this, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and also seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The draft report we are discussing proposes certain additions and adaptations to the Commission proposal, which are necessary in order to clarify and supplement the logic of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we are proposing to introduce consultations with professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States, which are involved in the process of devising information programmes for agricultural products, both on the internal market and in third countries. In view of their expertise and the important role these associations and organisations also play in guaranteeing and controlling quality, it is absolutely paramount that they are consulted. At the same time, we support these programmes being drawn up based on an assessment of the need for them and their timeliness, providing us with the assurance that the funds are being spent effectively in programmes which meet the objective of helping promote Community products.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also proposing to extend the areas where international organisations can be assigned the implementation of information programmes for third countries. Promotion and publicity measures are also relevant to the wine sector, both on the EU internal market and in third countries. As is the case with the olive oil and table olive sector, international bodies exist in the wine sector, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, which can ensure the implementation in third countries of programmes proposed by Member States, thereby disseminating information about the characteristics and advantages of wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment which we are proposing to you is aimed at increasing the European Union’s cofinancing percentage from 60% to 70% at a time when it is increasingly more difficult for small producers to gain access to financing due to the financial crisis. Without any financial support, they risk going bankrupt as they do not have the leverage to promote their products and are facing a drop in market demand.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole. Attaining this goal will help us overcome these difficult times we are going through. The quality of the European Union’s agricultural and food products is an advantage which we need to utilise in order to guarantee the European economy’s competitiveness and higher incomes for producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the recommendations we are going to adopt will be implemented as soon as possible by the European Commission and Member States because we cannot afford to waste time in such circumstances when European citizens are being hit by the effects of an extremely deep economic recession. The measures being proposed will obviously not resolve all the problems linked to marketing and promoting the Community’s agricultural and food products.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplifying the red tape involved with registering traditional products, introducing a ‘Made in the European Union’ label and solving the problem of products imported from third countries of lower quality and safety standards are just some of the areas which we need to consider in order to boost the market share for Community products. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your comments and questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress the importance of the issues addressed in this report. I think we all agree that the promotion of European agricultural products is of huge importance, both internally and externally. I am convinced that trade in agricultural products will continue to grow in the future – even if we have to admit that we face a setback at the present time owing to the economic crisis. However, there will be huge opportunities for our European products in third-country markets, and our promotion campaign should help European producers explore those new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Before going into the content of the report, I would like to put it into perspective. In 2008, the Commission adopted 42 programmes on the internal market and on third countries, representing a budget of EUR 128 million over three years. According to the rules, half of that amount was then to be financed by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission proposal is to make it possible for Member States to launch programmes cofinanced by the European Union in third countries – as described by the rapporteur – because today this possibility only exists for the internal market. It should also be possible for those programmes to be implemented by international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The three most important amendments from the rapporteur and his colleagues are as follows: firstly, to make it compulsory for Member States to consult trade associations about the proposed programmes; secondly, to specify that implementation by international organisations is not only a possibility reserved for the International Olive Oil Council, but a general possibility, for example – as mentioned here today – also in the wine sector; and, on the budget side, to increase the cofinancing rate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to those amendments, I would emphasise that Member States do, in fact, already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers. I would prefer that partnership approach to continue on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">My mentioning of the International Olive Oil Council is only meant as an example, because of the discussions that have recently taken place on the whole olive oil sector. It certainly does not exclude other international organisations, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the funding of the budget, there is, of course, ongoing discussion on the level of cofinancing by the Community, but we discussed this issue when merging the two regulations dealing with promotion and information in 2008, so I do not think we should re-open the discussion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I just take the opportunity to say that, when we agreed the wine reform, we did recognise the importance of promoting our products on third-country markets. Therefore, in the interests of spending the budget for wine in a smarter and more intelligent way, we proposed the earmarking of EUR 120 million each year for the promotion of our wine products on third country markets as a special budget line. However, since Member States – and especially the new Member States – did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that, if it was not spent, then it was lost, we included the EUR 120 million in the national envelopes, so that Member States can decide for themselves. In any case, this gives a clear signal that the Community does care and does recognise the importance of strong promotion of our European products. I look forward to the discussion here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report contains measures which will help open up new markets and make our farmers’ agricultural production profitable. This policy meets the actual needs of Member States wishing to promote their agricultural production, both among the Community’s consumers and among those in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It provides an excellent opportunity for the emphasis to be placed on quality, nutritional value, production methods and the safety of the food produced. I support the rapporteur’s proposal offering the opportunity to interested countries to put forward information programmes for third countries if the latter do not have this facility.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment will allow European countries to extend the practical scope of the measures envisaged by these programmes and to seek assistance from international organisations in implementing them. I believe that during the process of devising these programmes, consideration should be given to the important role played by the associations and industry organisations in the individual countries, which have an objective view of what is happening in the individual industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must note the importance of certain international bodies in promoting the specific characteristics and advantages of food products typical of particular EU regions. I support the rapporteur’s proposal for increasing the percentage rate for the Community's financial participation so that additional assistance can be provided to the projects selected by Member States. I urge you to support Mr Dumitriu’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries play an enormous role in creating a positive image of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand. I have been stressing this for a long time, and for several years I have been active in efforts to simplify the entire information provision and promotion system. In my speeches I have repeatedly stressed the necessity of promoting the ‘Made in Europe’ brand in third-country markets. This is especially legitimate in the formal and legal conditions of today.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Declaration of the Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, the use of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect will be eliminated in 2013. In view of the complicated nature of organising promotional campaigns in third-country markets and the higher costs of such measures at a significant distance, particularly in Asia or America, the mechanism for supporting promotional activities did not attract much interest from trade organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal of the European Commission allows for stimulation of their activity. Promotional programmes carried out by Member States offer the opportunity for entities to work together, where they have not managed to run and finance these activities on their own. Nevertheless, efforts to increase the percentage share of the Community in financing this type of project should be continued. I will mention as an example the United States of America, where several times more is spent on promotional activities than all the money allocated to wine and to activities in the area of other promotional products in the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of liberalisation of the commercial flow of agricultural products, an instrument to support the promotion of Community production in third-country markets might be the only tool available which accords with the guidelines of the Agriculture Framework Agreement in the WTO Doha Development Agenda Round. Promotion of the ‘Made in Europe’ brand is the chance to maintain competitiveness and, on a longer time-scale, even to strengthen the attractiveness of European agricultural and food products and to extend their market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for these measures, which we have repeatedly spoken of in Parliament, and which have been included, and especially for the reduction in contributions from trade organisations from 20% to 10% and for increasing the funds available for promotional activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet advertising comes about not only as a result of professional offensives but also of occurrences in the region from which the foodstuffs originate.</p>
<p class="contents">When the world associates us with BSE, when we have turned our heraldic animal mad, or when, as now, countries are issuing product recalls because of the dioxin problem – which, of course, is also going around the world – and when millions of slaughtered sick cattle are shown on television news around the world, this is also a kind of advertising: negative advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful to avoid contradiction here. On the one hand, there is our talk of good products but, on the other, there are the negative reports – but we are working on this, as we have just seen with the debate and what we have concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to advertise externally – yes, that is right, we have good reason to do so, as we have good products – I do not want it to be generalised advertising, but advertising showing European diversity. As you know, we have the situation in Germany where the Federal Constitutional Court has ruled against a kind of compulsory advertising with a compulsory levy. It pointed out that advertising that does not differentiate between the individual qualities does not increase sales, and that instead, it is important that the individual producers be able to advertise for their specific products.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is increasingly important – not only within Europe but also externally – to describe not only the quality of the end product but also the quality of the process. What is the situation with regard to animal protection, to the environment, to the ingredients, to the structure of the farming, to fair trade? These are all criteria that do not necessarily affect the quality of the end product, but are becoming increasingly important to consumers. We must incorporate this into our advertising too, therefore, and must see that Europe’s reputation in the world is further enhanced as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore support the proposals of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, namely those aimed at greater intervention and strengthening the role of trade associations and organisations operating in the sector, in view of their expertise and the important part they also play in ensuring quality control, including the associations and organisations of the Member State that draws up the programme, as well as increasing the percentage of the Community’s financial participation. It is important that there is additional aid, especially for projects selected by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, we believe that promotion and advertising actions in third countries should be able to benefit other important products in addition to olive oil and olives, with emphasis on wines with designations of origin or protected geographical indications. In this respect, I will also mention here the important role of farmers’ associations, with emphasis on cooperative wine cellars and other associations of small and medium-sized farmers, whose existence is fundamental in ensuring the flow of the produce of farmers who, on their own, would not be able to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would call for there to be enhanced support for these farmers’ organisations to be able to completely fulfil their role in upholding family farming and promoting the high-quality agricultural products they produce, which are essential in guaranteeing a healthy diet for the population of our countries.</p>

Stimulation of this may bring benefits to farmers, consumers and whole economies.</p>
<p class="contents">In many Member States, the consumption of food products essential for good health is not high, and its growth, by means of good information and promotion, is most desirable. However, it is important that EU farmers benefit from the programmes under discussion and, in particular, small and medium-sized farms, which comprise 95% of all farms.</p>
<p class="contents">These programmes should enrich consumers’ knowledge of healthy eating and, at the same time, leave the choice to them. This is why it is worth taking the following steps: organising consultations with specialists in the field of healthy diet and training salespeople, who should also be consumer advisors in matters of healthy diet. Good presentation of information about the health benefits of the products being promoted, and about the way the foods are produced, is essential. Information on food labels is insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme may be threatened by the promotion of food mass-produced by large food corporations, which can prepare effective programmes and which have the best specialists at their disposal. Except will this not then compromise the promotion of high quality foods?</p>
<p class="contents">Legibility of the expiry date on products is also very important, as is a rise in consumer awareness of the significance of all the information which is to be found on product labels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The information provision measures taken by the European Union are a response to a real need on the part of Member States to promote the image of their agricultural products, both among European consumers and consumers in other countries, especially as regards quality and nutritional value, as well as food safety and safe production methods. As quality rapporteur, I greatly cherish this competitive edge that our European products have.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative amendment will offer interested Member States the possibility to propose information programmes, including when there are no programmes put forward for third countries. As a result of this amendment, Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek the assistance of international organisations in implementing these measures. The percentage rate of the European Union’s financial participation needs to be increased in order to provide additional support for the projects selected by Member States, at a time of a general tightening of the conditions in which national organisations and authorities seek to obtain the amounts they must contribute to cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the idea that the organisation tasked with implementing the selected programme should be an international organisation, especially where the programme is aiming to promote the olive oil and table olive sector, not to mention the sector for wines with a protected designation of origin and those with a protected geographical indication in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must bear in mind the important role which professional associations and organisations operating in the target sectors of the Member States have in devising information programmes for agricultural products. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur once again, and especially Commissioner Vassiliou, because she has accepted all the proposals we have made within the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, most importantly, as a representative of a country that has earned worldwide recognition and respect for the quality of its agricultural produce – I am thinking of olive oil, wine and cheeses – I cannot help but approve of any action whatsoever that the Commission may propose to safeguard high quality European produce and to promote, where possible, the marketing of this produce both on the internal market and abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">This information programme is, in fact, particularly significant, since it is to make clear to European and other consumers that our produce is not in competition with that, which may be cheaper, from other countries, but rather that it represents an alternative that focuses on quality and on a production model that respects the environment and social and animal welfare standards which, in turn, naturally benefits human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation that we vote on in this House every day can come at a price, above all for our producers. That is why we must offer them all the help we can, so that the richness and quality of our produce is not lost and does not become ironed out in an ever-more homogeneous global market. For this reason, I support the rapporteur’s amendments, which are aimed at increasing Commission cofinancing, adding to the activities that can be funded and, most importantly, increasing participation in producers’ associations, which are best-placed to defend the qualitative features of their produce to ever-more exacting consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur himself has emphasised, the quality and safety of European products provide a competitive edge which has not been sufficiently utilised yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures aimed at providing information about and promoting these products, their quality and the food safety standards they comply with may trigger a chain reaction by boosting demand, increasing farmers’ production and profits and creating new jobs, which also implicitly means economic growth. These measures must be directed equally at consumers in the internal market and those in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget the competition we are facing on the internal market from producers from other countries, offering products which are sometimes cheaper, but where, very often, the quality and safety standards are much lower. Consumers need to recognise Community products and know why they are healthier than others. Last but not least, they must know that buying these products supports European farmers and agri-food producers and, therefore, the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly appreciate the initiative from the rapporteur on recognising the important role which professional associations and organisations play because, in most cases, they have the expertise which the country’s institutions do not have. They are also much more familiar with the real situation on the market and its requirements. At the same time, I think that the proposal to increase the cofinancing percentage is an absolute necessity in the current credit crisis. I strongly believe that this will increase the rate of use of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, on all his hard work and his proposals, a view which I believe all my fellow Members share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agricultural sector is important for the Member States’ economies because it provides food for the population, agricultural products for export, not to mention a large number of jobs. The European Union must be able to provide sufficient quantities of food for its population at affordable prices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that in a competitive market, information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries are becoming increasingly important. Professional associations or organisations must be consulted when it comes to drawing up the programmes for promoting agricultural products. I believe that this regulation will encourage European farmers to promote their agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania has a huge number of agri-food products which we do not, unfortunately, come across on European markets, even though many of them are environmentally friendly. A campaign to promote these products will benefit both European consumers and Romanian agricultural producers. Particularly at times of economic crisis, the agricultural sector obviously remains one of the sectors which must be given special attention, along with adequate programmes and funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In a crisis situation, Member States must focus greater attention when setting their priorities. This is why I believe that agriculture must remain an area which is supported because it is important for the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to endorse what you said. I believe the future of European agriculture policy is very much with the market. We have got to go out there and promote our high-quality products. You mentioned the wine reform – previously, we were taking a lot of low-quality wine out of the market, buying it into intervention and then making it into biofuel, which was absolutely the wrong way to go. What we should be doing is promoting quality food. We have got a great diversity of wines, cheeses, meats, olive oil, fruits, vegetables – you name it. Europe is rich in all these and we must go out and market them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, as we move beyond the Health Check into the new agriculture policy in 2013 and beyond, we have got to make sure that we use more money to promote our products and to link into the marketplace, because that is where the future lies.</p>

It is great to hear such enthusiasm and interest in this important issue. I think that all the comments here are, to a certain extent, very much in line with the Commission’s view on the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the questions or issues raised here. First of all on the financing – this has been raised by quite a few of you – to increase the cofinancing rate. I think, though, that we have to be very cautious and careful when we try to monitor the benefit of the Community financing because I fear that if we increase the cofinancing, the bottom line will be that there will be less promotion. That would be a bad outcome and that is the reason why we have maintained our proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality has been mentioned quite a few times today and I agree with you. I think we have a golden opportunity to discuss this quality issue that is also linked to how we promote our products in the Third World, how we explain to consumers what they get when they buy European.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October, we presented a Green Paper on quality and we have had lots of contributions; there are more than 1 000 contributions on the website from all over Europe. We are now digesting all these different ideas and we will present a communication in May. We should take this opportunity when the discussion takes place here in Parliament on communication to make a link – how do we improve our possibilities to make it visible and make it understandable. Here the labelling issue, which is both difficult and important, comes into the discussions, so I am looking forward to having a discussion with you on this issue in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding the school fruit scheme which has been raised here today – it is not part of the proposal, but just to keep you updated – we introduced a school fruit scheme with a cofinancing rate of 70% to increase the awareness of young people and to take the opportunity to underline the importance of good eating habits among school children.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Dumitriu, for a very good report. I think it is very well mirrored here today by the dynamic discussion that we have had. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you for the extremely relevant comments and views you have expressed about this report. I am confident that our remaining fellow Members will consider that the new regulations being proposed are appropriate and that we will vote in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to advise fellow Members that I will support their suggestions, especially those aimed at promoting European diversity, introducing European quality labelling and more consistent financial support from the Community. I have been asked: why wine, along with olive oil among the international organisations which can implement promotion projects? I would like to respond with another question: why olive oil then? My response is positive on both counts. They are highly successful export products from European Union Member States. They have powerful, experienced international organisations which have already demonstrated their ability to manage complex programmes. Indeed, the report’s provisions do not exclude other areas. As regards the second question about the 70% rate for cofinancing, the initial percentage rate was 60% and I felt that, in the current economic climate, it was necessary to increase it.</p>
<p class="contents">As experience from the uptake of European funds has shown so far, one of the biggest problems remains how to obtain cofinancing, especially at the moment when we are faced, on top of this, with a credit crisis. This is why this rate needs to be increased, otherwise we risk ending up with the funds not being used. Mrs Fischer Boel, I would like to thank you for the importance you have given to this report, in particular for the views you have expressed. Although this is a consultation report, I hope and I would like these amendments to be included in the Commission’s new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To finally sum up, there are two reasons why this report is necessary. Member States will have the opportunity to expand the area of application of the measures targeted by these programmes and seek assistance from the international organisations in implementing these measures. It assigns a greater role to professional organisations and associations in the process of drawing up and implementing product information and promotion programmes. Last but not least, it is part of the logic of the proposals for adapting European legislation in order to make the use of European funds more accessible by increasing the cofinancing percentage rate during a time when it is extremely difficult to gain access to credit. As a further recommendation, I would also like to mention that the report was adopted unanimously by the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Committee for the support they provided. I would personally like to thank Neil Parish for the support he gave me and, last but not least, Lutz Goepel for the trust he placed in me when he assigned me this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have all worked together, and I commend the outstanding work of the shadow rapporteurs. We visited no fewer than 26 detention centres in 10 EU Member States, and we noted several key points. We observed, in certain centres, an obvious state of decay and an obvious lack of hygiene, and we denounced the failure to respect human dignity. We found that access to healthcare was not always possible and that the children’s right to education was not always respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for respect for clear, fair, effective and proportionate asylum procedures, and we call for the implementation of a permanent system of visits and inspections of detention centres. We must show the reality on the ground and stand up for a right to inspect these centres – something that these kinds of visits permit – and we must do so in order to take action so that things change.</p>
<p class="contents">The press has asked me why we did not cite any countries in this summary report. I replied that it was my choice, that it was our choice, since we have a collective responsibility with regard to what goes on in detention centres in Europe, and the purpose of this report is not to rank the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not stop calling for European solidarity in the area of asylum. We cannot leave the Member States, at Europe’s borders, on their own to face large migratory flows. I repeat once again: we have a collective responsibility.</p>

<p class="contents">As we know, the European Parliament has wished for many years to express its views on small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent 99% of all European companies and 75 million jobs, while today only 3% of these SMEs access the foreign, external market and only 8% access the internal market.</p>

First of all, there is a paragraph that states that the Member States that have not yet recognised Kosovo’s independence should still do so. Well, a paragraph of this nature is in contravention of the principle of subsidiarity. It is up to the Member States themselves to decide, and they do not need any external pressure from the European Commission, the Council or Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why I have voted against the resolution is to do with the paragraph that states that Kosovo, and the entire region, in fact, should have a clear prospect of EU membership. It is wrong, in my view, for Parliament to make promises of this kind.

<p class="contents">Kosovo had an unquestioned right to self-determination: it was expressed in a referendum with a participation rate and a turnout of more than 90%. However, by an extension of that logic, so, surely, have those Kosovans of Serb extraction, who are clustered conveniently close to the border with Serbia proper. Why not allow them also to enjoy self-government? We do it de facto, so why do we not do it de jure?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer is because we would rather keep Kosovo as a European protectorate – as a satrapy, such as it was in Ottoman times. We forced on them a version of our 12-star flag and a version of our national anthem. We have a Kosovan Parliament and institutions subject to the overriding decisions of an appointed European commissar.</p>
<p class="contents">We should allow the people of Kosovo to have referendums on partition – if that is what they want – and on ethnic self-determination, and we should allow that same right to the subject peoples of the European Union. <span class="italic">Pactio Olisipiensis Censenda Est</span>! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I did have one major concern about this report, which was the reference to trade defence instruments. We have to recognise that consumers in my country – Britain – and in many other countries across the European Union, have benefited from open trade with China. It helped us at the time to fight perils such as inflation. However, protecting uncompetitive EU producers at the expense of other parties who benefit is something that we should tackle with care. We should make sure that we get the right balance and do not ignore the benefits of trade with China for consumers, companies with globalised supply chains and the retail sector. On the whole, trade with China is to be welcomed. Eventually, that will lead to all the other issues being tackled, such as better human rights and labour issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This review of the 2003 ‘Reception Conditions Directive’, which laid down minimum standards for the reception of people seeking asylum in Europe, aims to enforce the implementation of these rules, such as access to information, education, healthcare and standards regarding reception facilities. The Directive allows Member States to determine the length of time during which an applicant cannot have access to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland unfortunately did not opt into the 2003 Directive, and operates a ‘direct provision’ system, providing accommodation, food and EUR 19.10 per week per adult, designed to discourage asylum seekers from choosing Ireland, and keeping them out of the official labour market for the entirety of their application procedure. Legislation currently before the Oireachtas – the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008 – seeks to extend this prohibition, despite grave concerns about the impact of such decisions. Other measures in the Irish legislation include criminalising ‘spurious’ appeals and the prospect of fines to legal representatives who take on such cases.</p>

A common immigration and asylum policy would run the risk of leading to ‘Fortress Europe’, something that we are already seeing clear signs of today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is small and medium-sized enterprises, and not the major transnationals, that are the victims of the market liberalisation promoted by the EU (as if a framework where ‘survival of the fittest’ rules could work in their favour).

Much is being said at present about the improvement in conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises in the internal market of the European Union, especially in the context of the proposed Small Business Act.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises make up over 99% of all enterprises in Europe. However, undertaking business activity which crosses national borders is more the domain of large firms. Barely 8% of small and medium-sized enterprises export to destinations beyond their own national borders. If, however, we are talking about undertaking business activity beyond the borders of the European Union, this step is taken by barely 3% of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that internationalised enterprises show great innovative ability. And innovativeness is the key to competitiveness and growth of the European economy. I therefore hope that internal market policies will offer SMEs the full range of benefits which the common market brings, and when it is possible, that they will lay the foundations for internationalisation of the activities of SMEs. Small and medium-sized enterprises should also receive greater support from Member States and the European Commission, in areas including the promotion of exports or the search for potential trade partners, in particular, in relation to market-leading products and services and new technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is significant especially now, in the face of economic collapse. The number of SMEs (up to 250 employees; turnover ≤ EUR 50 million) in the EU reaches 23 million, which comprises around 99% of all firms active in our market. Over 75 million people work in these SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">The calls directed to the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities for effective support of these businesses, including unhindered access to loans, are therefore justified. In addition, trade needs to be made easier and bureaucratic export and import barriers need to be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to public procurement, whose complicated and not always unequivocal procedures hinder the access of SMEs, the market should be made more open, both inside the EU and in third countries. As I have shown in my report on innovation policy, the role of SMEs in this sector is difficult to overestimate. This is because they are more flexible and open to modern technologies and organisational methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Special treatment is required for SMEs in the agriculture and food sector, where care needs to be taken over protection of the designations of origin of products, and imitations which are harmful to the health of consumers need to be resisted. I also endorse the idea of organising European SMP Week in May 2009.

<p class="contents">I voted in favour of Mrs Muscardini’s report as it reveals the key strategy for the SMEs’ survival during a difficult economic period. This relates to political and financial support aimed at fostering product and process innovation and improving access to financial and fiscal information, including internationalisation. It also means the adoption of a firm stance in the negotiations on trade facilitation procedures in order to lower the costs of customs formalities, which can account for up to 15% of the value of the goods traded, as well as effective recording of the origin of goods and updated customs controls.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Romania is concerned, the internationalisation of SMEs is a solution which, in the current economic crisis, will crucially help them to survive and develop their business, thereby playing an essential role in creating new jobs.</p>

This also concerns cross-border transactions. The growth in recent years of transactions made over the Internet engenders optimism concerning the level of confidence which consumers have in the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">However, barriers still exist, such as language, which will be difficult to eliminate. Another serious threat to international trade over the Internet is the lack of legal certainty and consumer protection. I hope that the proposed directive on consumer rights will eliminate some of these and will be an additional stimulus to the development of Internet commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Internet allows small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in international markets with very low costs in comparison with traditional methods, and offers possibilities previously unavailable to them to develop their business.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Internet commerce also gives rise to questions, especially about the sale of counterfeit products which are protected by intellectual property rights. Counterfeit products are a serious problem for Internet trade, especially because people who sell counterfeit products internationally cannot easily be brought to justice. Consumers who use the Internet are also often the victims of fraud, such as the theft of money by electronic means. All these phenomena undermine consumer confidence in Internet trade, and this slows down the development of international Internet trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has opened up new markets and broken down barriers to trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has rightly pointed out that, although there has been a rise in fraud and counterfeiting, this should not be attributed to the Internet itself, but rather regarded as an issue that existed before and that needs tackling in new and innovative ways, as long as this does not impinge on our civil liberties. It also points out that it should be viewed as an opportunity for cultural diversity rather than a threat. Finally, it recognises that liberalisation of services connected to the Internet, such as telecoms, has led to a boom in infrastructure investment, so I believe we should be cautious about applying further regulation on such industries, as the Commission seems intent on doing at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The compromise procedure worked out with the help of the European Court of Justice appears, at first glance, to be reasonable, but it is, however, detached from reality, for it is difficult to imagine a farmer who, while already working night and day in principle, is sufficiently interested in the matter to waste time and money on complicated appeal procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific information on the composition of feedstuffs should be available on the label, not only because of the inalienable right of the consumer but, above all, because of the basic objective of the directive, which is to protect health.

Despite this, I back the alternative resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. It would, after all, be more logical if Parliament waited to show its endorsement of the EPAs until the parliaments of the ACP countries involved had determined their positions. In my view, the parliamentary body that monitors the EPAs should be the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and not a body that has been set up for this specific purpose. This would only have a divisive effect and weaken the position of the countries in the South that do not have the financial or personal means at their disposal to attend all these meetings.

<p class="contents">With this resolution, we found out that ‘the most important of the European Security and Defence Policy (of the EU) missions to date’ is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and a dangerous precedent in terms of international law, with unpredictable consequences for the stability of borders, particularly on the European continent.</p>

In this plenary, debates on Kosovo are usually not about Kosovo itself, but mainly about the effect it has on the rest of the world. Those in favour and against independence are mainly concerned about each decision setting a precedent for other regions and about the risk of the European Union indulging in self-aggrandisement as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been arguing in favour of the opposite for 30 years, both within and outside this Parliament. Democracy requires us, above all, to look at the needs and desires of the people themselves. After centuries of Turkish rule and the last century of Serbian rule, the last thing they need is coercion from outside. If they are not allowed to annex to Albania, they want true independence.</p>
<p class="contents">For the past 10 years, I have been advocating politics from the grassroots up, from the viewpoint of the poor, the disadvantaged, the people who suffer as a result of a lack of democracy and public provisions, the victims of environmental disasters or wars, in short, everyone who is disadvantaged due to a lack of equality for all people. I will be voting against the EULEX project because it does not provide solutions in the interests of the ordinary people of Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia, even in the presence of international personalities and organisations, were lengthy and many people saw no chance that they would produce a solution or even that they would continue. That is why most EU countries and the USA accepted the Aktisari plan.

Economic stability and the sustainability of trade flows involving the EU are becoming ever more relevant to our future security. I voted in favour of Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report on economic and commercial relations with China because I believe that this is a step towards a better structure of commercial relations between the European Union and a crucial global partner.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for this report is highlighted by the hard reality of the trade deficit of EUR 160 billion. However, most of the elements in this report are not only requests from the European Union in relation to certain aspects of Beijing’s economic and trade policy, but also suggestions whose implementation will bring benefits to China internally, as well as looking ahead to its future development. Better regulation and protection of intellectual property, the reduction of the social and environmental impact from our Asian partner’s dramatic economic growth and the reduction in the counterfeiting and piracy of goods are areas for action where Beijing has already made notable progress. If this can be maintained in the future it will only help boost China’s development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Trade between the EU and China has increased dramatically since 2000. The EU is China’s largest trading partner and China is the second largest trading partner of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Although China enjoys significant advantages as a result of its membership of the WTO, European firms must overcome major obstacles in trying to gain access to the Chinese market, the main ones being breaches of patent rights and an ambiguous system of standards. I welcome the intention of launching a ‘Gateway to China’ programme aimed especially at establishing training programmes for managers in China with a view to supporting access to the Chinese market for European SMEs by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The report provides recommendations for improving trade relations between Europe and China which must be based on principles of reciprocity, sustainable development, respect for environmental limits, contributions to global targets on combating climate change, fair economic competition and trade that is in accordance with our shared values and with WTO rules. I welcomed the amended proposal in which the EU regards Taiwan as a commercial and trading entity and supports Taiwanese participation as an observer in relevant international organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is understandable. The objections raised by the relationship with China can be understood in the light of various assessments, which are, in most cases, justifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">The perception that Chinese economic growth has no parallel in the respect of human rights and democracy in that country, nor in its actions at international level, the exploitation of workers, a regulatory framework on labour that is incomparably less demanding, disregard for environmental matters and for rules on intellectual property and patents, all these factors are barriers to open trade relations that are marked by respect for international good practice. Nevertheless, this trade is there, and it is growing. China’s role in the modern world economy is unequalled and its participation in overcoming the present crisis is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to insist on respect for the rules and principles of international trade, for equal access to markets and for the defence of democracy and human rights, without rejecting the reality and our growing interdependency. In fact, we need to make the most of this situation, if only to better influence this great country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">China is the second largest trading partner of the EU, and the EU has been China’s largest trading partner since 2006. It is a country which is a driving force of world growth. It is very important that the trade relations of European countries with China be based, above all, on the principles of reciprocity, sustainable development, respect for environmental limits and fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Development of trade relations with China should go hand in hand with political dialogue which should include the subject of human rights. China should increase efforts in the area of enforcement of intellectual property rights and address the problem connected with the production of counterfeit and pirated goods inside China.</p>
<p class="contents">The high level of pollution caused by Chinese industry and its growing consumption of natural resources is also disturbing.</p>
<p class="contents">The breakdown in negotiations with envoys of the Dalai Lama casts a shadow over relations with China. China should cease all forms of persecution of the Tibetan people.</p>

<p class="contents">For example, with regard to future steps to be taken by the European Union, I do not agree that it is necessary to prevent problems through bilateral dialogue. The fact is, bringing together senior decision makers from the Chinese leadership and their counterparts from the European Commission cannot adequately address issues of mutual concern, especially in the areas of investment, market access and intellectual property rights protection and other strategic issues related to trade.

Under President Ma, Taiwan has made great strides towards normalising its trade relations with China and trying to end the obstructionist attitude that Beijing’s communist rulers have previously taken towards commercial relations with Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if Taiwan is ever to be fully integrated with the regional economies of south-east Asia, it needs to be accepted into international organisations, regardless of whether or not it is recognised as an independent sovereign state.</p>
<p class="contents">Given various health scares in East Asia in recent years related to the movement of goods and people – such as SARS, avian influenza and the melamine milk scandal – it is essential that Taiwan is given the status of observer at the World Health Assembly. Such a move would strengthen cross-straits trade, drive up quality standards in the region and elevate Taiwan on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The way that China has used its disagreements with Taiwan to play politics with matters of public health is to be deprecated. So too is the shameful silence that so many people in Europe keep in the face of China’s pressure.</p>

The Sri Lankan army is carrying out attacks on the civilian population that could even be described as massacres. A hospital has even come under fire and, according to humanitarian organisations, the overall situation is disastrous. The Red Cross has raised the alarm.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Sri Lanka has escalated, and the European Union is not blameless in this, having torpedoed the negotiations that were held under the leadership of Norway by placing the LTTE on the EU list of terrorist organisations. This meant that negotiations within the European Union were no longer possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sri Lanka itself, freedom of the press no longer exists. Recently, a journalist was killed. The German ambassador, who spoke at his funeral, was described by the President as someone who should leave the country. All he had done was to describe the situation accurately.</p>
<p class="contents">There is talk of thousands of refugees in the north, and I must make it quite clear that the whole situation there is one on which we should be focusing much more attention. The European Union should be coming out very much more clearly against what the Sri Lankan Government is currently doing. The attacks by both the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE are wrong; it is clear that it is mainly civilians who are being hit.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to help the people trapped in the north and to achieve an immediate cease-fire, as it is quite clear that very large numbers of civilians are being killed there. This is unacceptable, and the European Union shares the blame for this if it fails to state much more clearly that the support for the Sri Lankan Government must end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The LTTE, which has been blacklisted by the EU as a terrorist organisation, must now surely lay down its arms and surrender. The EU and other Co-chairs have urged the LTTE to do so. The LTTE’s response will show us whether it really has the best interests of Tamils at heart.</p>
<p class="contents">The LTTE is using its front organisations in Europe to maximum propaganda effect and raising money by extortion internationally. Some LTTE militants may even try to seek asylum within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this ferocious 26-year civil war, the LTTE has pioneered atrocious terrorist tactics, such as suicide bombings, that are now used in many other parts of the world – regrettably. The Sri Lankan army has had, therefore, to deploy all the means at its disposal to counteract this brutal insurgency. However, it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the LTTE have been exaggerated. Some have now been withdrawn – for instance, the <span class="italic">Agence Presse</span> story of 300 civilians killed, after the supposed author denied authorship. Nevertheless, the death of civilians in a war zone is tragic whenever and wherever it occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Sri Lankan armed forces cannot claim an unblemished record either, but they have not sought to deliberately exploit civilians and put them in harm’s way, like the LTTE has allegedly done.</p>
<p class="contents">If the war really is soon to be over, it is essential that Sri Lanka turn its attention now to post-conflict disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. The marginalisation of Tamils, at the expense of the majority Sinhalese, needs to be addressed in an urgent and permanent manner in order to ensure a stable and sustainable multiethnic society with regional devolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should also ensure resources are put at Sri Lanka’s disposal to support post-conflict development. Although we should support the Government’s offer of amnesty for the majority of the LTTE, it is vital that no one responsible for the most serious war crimes is allowed to get away with impunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tragic situation came about as a result of the armed conflict mainly between separatist insurgent forces in the north and the Sri Lankan army. During this fighting, thousands of innocent people were killed and injured and much destruction to property, infrastructure and the environment has been caused.</p>
<p class="contents">This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated in recent months mainly due to the Government’s large-scale military offensive against the Tamil Tigers. Reports coming out of Sri Lanka indicate that the situation in certain areas has, in recent weeks, deteriorated tragically, with hundreds of civilians displaced and caught up in the fighting. According to Amnesty International, there have been violations of international conventions and human rights by both Government and Tamil Tiger forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, it is very difficult in such circumstances to be absolutely sure as to who is to be blamed for some of the tragic events in Sri Lanka, but we must call on both sides to exercise restraint and to pay utmost attention and respect to innocent civilians, and to observe the conventions of war.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Sri Lankan Government has the upper hand in the situation and is the internationally-recognised authority in the country, our call must, by necessity and logic, go mostly to them. At the same time, we must call on the Tamil Tiger leaders to abide by the calls of the international community, take advantage of the Government’s offer of amnesty, renounce violence and seek to achieve their aims through political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also once again advise emphatically that fighting solves no problems, and that lasting peace and stability can only be achieved at the negotiating table, which will inevitably happen sooner or later. In these negotiations, compromises will have to be made by both sides and a solution found which will be for the benefit of the citizens of this beautiful country. We hope that through this resolution we will help to lessen the suffering of the Sri Lankan people and to bring about much-needed peace in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last month, Parliament held a full debate, with Council and Commission statements, on the situation in Gaza. On this side of the House, we attach the same importance to Sri Lanka and believe it deserved equal and proper discussion, but I regret that not one other group supported us in this stand.</p>
<p class="contents">A short debate this afternoon with a handful of people on a Thursday is an insult to the thousands of people under attack and dying in the north of Sri Lanka. We wanted to call, as in the joint USA and UK declaration from Washington earlier this week, for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire by both sides, but the PPE refused to include that in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to condemn, unreservedly, the bombing of hospitals and aid workers, but Mr Van Orden, negotiating for the PPE, refused to condemn it. That is why it is not in the resolution before you. To him – and presumably to Dr Tannock as well – everything the Government of Sri Lanka says is a fact and just about every aid organisation on the ground, from the Red Cross to the UN, can be dismissed. Amnesty International today suggests the Sri Lankan army could be guilty of war crimes for its use of cluster bombs on a hospital – a 16-hour bombardment, according to Amnesty International.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE also wanted to condemn the murders of journalists and other media workers by government agents. Paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the Government – the very same Sri Lankan Government – to investigate their own serious human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, some of you may want to associate yourselves and your groups with those kinds of sentiments, but we do not. Vote for this text and you are condoning attacks on hospitals and ignoring allegations of war crimes. I note that Mr Van Orden has not even had the courage to stand here and defend his bloody handiwork, but I am hardly surprised. In our negotiations, he just dismissed and laughed off as propaganda allegations of rape by Sri Lankan soldiers, so what you can expect?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East, millions of people – including many Jews – were outraged at what Israel did to Gaza, but that did not make them supporters of Hamas. Sadly, anyone who does not support the Sri Lankan Government is labelled an apologist for terrorism and a supporter of the LTTE.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our motion was critical of the LTTE and their tactics. We do condemn their attacks and we do want them, the Tamil Tigers, to sit round the negotiating table, but this war must be stopped immediately. The Government must end its military campaign that has brought – as others have said – humanitarian disaster to hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in the north of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, this resolution does not call for an immediate end to the fighting, so we will not endorse that approach by taking part in today’s vote. We dissociate ourselves, President and colleagues, from this motion and I urge anyone else with the same views to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it suffers from excessive complacency in relation to the government in Colombo. I fear that it is another case of simplification, criminalisation and continued persecution of a group by simply arguing that it is a terrorist group. In fact, things are much more complex.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do believe that the current situation is such that Parliament should send out clear messages about certain issues. For example, one of the key points that I consider important to emphasise is the Tokyo appeal on the need for both sides, namely the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) and the government, to understand that a cease-fire must be agreed to allow humanitarian aid to get through and for the wounded and ill to be evacuated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that it is essential to remember that there cannot be a military solution, Mr Tannock. This cannot happen, it is simply impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is therefore the time to negotiate terms for the cessation of violence, demobilisation and disarmament. However, for this to occur, the government must stop seeking a military victory that merely prolongs the suffering of so many people.</p>
<p class="contents">A goodwill gesture would be, for example, to allow independent media and humanitarian personnel to enter the north.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in relation to the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, the GSP Plus, I am one of those who think that it should never have been granted to a country such as Sri Lanka, given the serious and continuing breaches of fundamental human rights in the country, many of these breaches being instigated by government authorities. I think that we should seriously consider opening an in-depth debate on the relevance of applying this preferential framework and, above all, on the consequences that it has for many groups, including workers.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I call upon the European Commission to carry out an <span class="italic">in situ</span> investigation to establish the effects of the measure and to review it if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I saw for myself on the ground how much the population is suffering as a result of the civil war that has been going on for 25 years and has claimed 70 000 lives. Fighting between government forces and the LTTE has further escalated. Large parts of the north have been brought under control and strongholds of the Tamil rebels have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">What human rights organisations in both Colombo and Jaffna told me at the time is unfortunately confirmed time and again: ‘war is an institution’. The humanitarian situation is alarming. There are refugees in their thousands. There is a lack of medical care and of food. Aid agencies must be given unrestricted access to the civilian population in a cease-fire to be agreed. The government has set up corridors to facilitate the evacuation of civilians from the combat areas; it is incomprehensible that the Tamil Tigers have failed to respect this safe zone, are continuing to fire and are using people as human shields.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tokyo group, consisting of Japan, the United States, Norway and the European Union, has called on the LTTE leadership to negotiate the details of a cease-fire with the Sri Lankan Government at long last.

What reports do we have to go on when all the NGOs, except the Red Cross, have been evacuated from the country since September? Who should we believe? The Sri Lankan Government or anonymous witnesses?</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: the situation is developing into a final assault, into a kill for a government set on using force to put a stop to a rebellion that has lasted too long for its liking. Once again, who is picking up the pieces, ladies and gentlemen? All the civilians, women, children, the elderly, of course, who are stuck in the middle and suffering unbearable violence. This has to stop. It is high time the international community really put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government so that it stops this escalation of violence and killing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must adopt a very clear position and not make the Tamil civilians the people history overlooked and the martyrs of indifference. Our European Parliament must not stop at this joint resolution. We must demand an immediate and unconditional cease-fire, which will mark the beginning of a stronger commitment in favour of a peaceful end to this conflict, with respect shown for human rights and cultural identities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we all know, whilst it may be possible to end a war by means of weapons, it is not possible to establish lasting peace this way. In addition, there can be no effective, lasting fight against terrorism, in particular, by means of weapons, as terrorism always finds a way. Therefore, it is important to get to grips with the causes.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step must be to reach a peace settlement based on the following fundamental elements. Firstly, a clear monopoly of power on the part of the unitary State. No State can allow ethnic groups or sections of the population to arm and engage in armed conflict. This requires, however, that this State comply with democratic rules and the rule of law and actively seek a political solution along the lines of autonomy, one that finally resolves Sri Lanka’s nationality problems, which are an old historical legacy and also a legacy of colonial times, and which need to be tackled urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I wish to appeal quite clearly to the European Union and all the countries of this earth to help with the development of democracy and the rule of law, with the strengthening of autonomy and of minority rights, and of course also with the economic development of a country that has been bled dry so appallingly by the terror of this civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if the guns were to fall silent at long last – unfortunately we are not at that stage yet – this would not mean the end of developments, but only the beginning of movement towards a peace based on the rule of law, freedom, human rights, minority rights and national autonomy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a quarter of a million civilians trapped in the conflict zone need safe passage and they must be provided with humanitarian aid. Foreign observers must have access to the area in order to assess humanitarian needs. However, the recent attacks on journalists provide no guarantee of safety for humanitarian organisations. Although the government has promised to investigate the attack on journalists, that is no solution. We must also put pressure on the Sri Lankan Government to sign up to the Ottawa Convention and to remove land mines.

In speaking of the tragedy of poor people, we forget that people are also the cause of the tragedy – not poor people, but people who come from the same environment. To gain power, they use religious, tribal and ethnic differences, historical misunderstandings and other available means to sow discord between sections of society in the country concerned. This leads to the destruction of usually very weakly rooted elements of democracy and to civil war with all its cruelties, to a disregard for human rights and for information, and to the total destruction of the opponent.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the resolution as an expression of disapproval towards those who resurrect civil wars and towards those who give them material and political support. One kind of warning to the creators of such inhumane scenarios could be the awareness that they will be captured, for example, by international special forces, and sentenced to life imprisonment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are deeply concerned by the current situation and the tragic humanitarian consequences of the conflict as expressed in the statement issued locally by the Co-Chairs on 3 February 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">We look with concern at the difficult situation of thousands of internally displaced persons trapped by fighting in northern Sri Lanka. Both Commissioners Ferrero-Waldner and Michel have already communicated publicly their preoccupation about the consequences of the hostilities on the civilian population and have called on both parties, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan authorities, to protect the civil population, as required under international humanitarian law, and to allow the safe and voluntary movement of people away from the combat zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is concerned about the information it has received concerning the conditions in which internally displaced people are living in the so-called ‘welfare centres’ once they have escaped from the territory controlled by the Tamil Tigers into Government-controlled areas. It is also important that international standards be respected in these temporary camps. UN agencies, the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations should have full access to these centres in line with international humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to be alarmed about the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, against a background of reports of extrajudicial killings, abductions and serious intimidation of the media. It is very important that the Government follows up on the most prominent high-profile cases. In her recent meeting with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to take decisive action to tackle human rights abuses, including action against the perpetrators, and to guarantee press freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to be convinced that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict. An inclusive dialogue is required to agree on a political settlement so that lasting peace and reconciliation can be achieved by addressing the concerns which led to the insurgency in the first place, and to provide adequate space for all communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Oppression and poverty have caused many people to flee the country, or to try to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The country’s ethnic diversity both justifies and reinforces this dictatorship. In large areas, minority peoples are in the majority. They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship. The military leaders consider their dictatorship necessary to be able to keep the country together permanently and to subjugate the rebellious people. They are more interested in the territory than in the people who live in it. By issuing major exploitation concessions to foreign businesses, vital sources of income are taken from the indigenous people, with nature and the environment being seriously damaged in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to flee the country is further reinforced by the fact that no consideration is given to the regional majority peoples. The regime is keen to eliminate troublesome groups, either by killing them or by chasing them out of the country. Many flee into the sea in makeshift dinghies, running the considerable risk of drowning. Burma’s neighbour, Thailand, has seen many refugees cross the border: according to some estimates, as many as two million people have fled over the past 25 years, and tens of thousands who have been refused entry remain homeless in the no man’s land along the border.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, feelings of sympathy or solidarity with refugees are even less well developed in South East Asia than they are in Europe. Very often, refugees are sent home, even if this means certain death. Public opinion shows little interest, even if it involves people who share their religion, such as the Muslim boat refugees who ended up in Indonesia from Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments also give priority to good relations with their colleagues in dictatorial states, instead of bringing pressure to bear in order to improve the situation there. Some in Europe even tend towards adopting a similar attitude, and we can see the disastrous impact this has in Asia. This is another reason why we should urge the Asian countries to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Rohingya people have suffered double discrimination for years. As Muslims, they are being denied the right to practise their faith freely, a right that we in the EU recognise as fundamental, and their mosques have been damaged and desecrated. As an ethnic minority, the Rohingya people are systematically denied civil rights that most of the rest of the world take for granted: the right to marry, the right to move freely, the right to citizenship of the country they live in, and the right to a proper education.</p>
<p class="contents">In praising our own progressive achievements in the field of human rights, we in the EU can tend to lose sight of the fact that many people in the world lack even these basic entitlements. We in this House are well aware of the plight of the people of Burma generally, but since the riots by Buddhist monks of 2007, that country has rather faded somewhat from the public consciousness.</p>
<p class="contents">The appalling fate of the little-known-about Rohingya people, especially those fleeing by boat as refugees that are the subject of this resolution, has renewed our attention on the despotic regime in Burma, a country so rich in human potential otherwise. The brutality of the military junta stands in stark contrast to the action of Thailand, which has only partially, in my view, discharged its responsibility for the Rohingya refugees as it unfortunately alleges that most of them are purely economic refugees which I believe to be highly unlikely, and tried sending them back. Thailand must take more seriously its growing role as a force for stability and humanity in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, we can expect very little from the brutal Burmese military leaders, impervious as they have been to our many pleas for years. I hope that the junta generals’ contempt for civilised opinion one day comes back to haunt them, possibly in an international criminal tribunal, when Burma is finally freed of tyranny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Amongst these destitute people are the indigenous Rohingya community of Western Burma who, in recent years, have been the victims of ethnic cleansing carried out by the Burmese Government. Unfortunately, the Thai authorities have not provided those refugees with the humanitarian assistance they so clearly deserve. Instead, it is reported that these people have been fiercely persecuted. We call on the Thai Government to respect the human rights of Burmese refugees and to treat them with respect, compassion, dignity and humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution also gives me the opportunity to deal with the issue of the 41-year-old Australian writer of Cypriot origin, Harry Nicolaides, who was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in Thailand for allegedly insulting the country’s Royal Family in a novel he wrote in 2005. Mr Nicolaides was teaching English at a Thai university at the time, and in his novel he only makes an anonymous reference to a member of the Thai Royal Family, and the incriminated work is clearly fictitious.</p>
<p class="contents">During his trial, Mr Nicolaides was paraded in front of the international media in chains and told reporters that he had endured unspeakable suffering. Mr Nicolaides has apologised to the Thai Royal Family and has made an appeal for royal grace.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Mr Nicolaides has been subjected to enough punishment and ill-treatment by the Thai authorities, who have handled this case most insensitively and inappropriately, and we call on them, as well as the Royal Family, to effect Mr Nicolaides’ immediate release and return to his home in Australia. To not do so would be most unwise, pitiful and damaging to Thailand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Muslim minority in Buddhist Burma, they are not recognised as one of Burma’s ethnic minorities. They have few legal rights and, as Amendment 3 tabled by Glenys Kinnock highlights, they face deliberate impoverishment, denial of citizenship, denial of freedom of movement, arbitrary taxation, land confiscation and the denial of permission to marry.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no wonder that many attempt to leave Burma as they have no other option. The shocking reports that a thousand Rohingya boat people over a 12-day period, who, instead of being brought to safety by the Thai authorities who discovered them, were instead towed into international waters without navigational equipment, food and water and left to fend for themselves, sickens anyone with an iota of human decency.</p>
<p class="contents">Only yesterday, an article in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> highlighted other incidents. The latest case involved 220 men, who were discovered in an open craft by fishermen. These refugees claimed they were detained by Thai authorities on a remote island for two months, and that they were beaten before being forced onto boats and left to their fate.</p>
<p class="contents">The abuse and lack of international coordinated action to help the Rohingya must be addressed. Thailand must also take responsibility. The Thai Prime Minister must act. The problems of abuse at the hands of Thai officials must be seriously addressed. The Thai Government must sign the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 Protocol. As Joel Chamy, Vice-President of Washington-based Refugees International, said, the Rohingya need protection and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">Thailand has said it is unwilling to grant that, but that is a problem that will not go away. There are ongoing reports of the treatment of Burmese refugees who enter Malaysia. Many of these people are sold as slaves, the women and children are forced into sexual slavery and the men are sold as forced labour onto fishing vessels. Some of this fish may even enter the EU market. I hope that today, we can highlight the plight of Burmese refugees and particularly the plight of the Rohingya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There I saw with my own eyes the injustice with which we treat some parts of the world in political and media terms.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, we are only moved by headline news. What we have seen in Burma, which is now no longer on the front pages, is a drama that is not so different from what has mobilised us in many other cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We have very clear examples of persecution, torture, illegal detention, rape and other atrocities committed by the Burmese military junta. One of the most shameful recent actions has been the adoption of a so-called constitution that violates the most basic democratic principles and guarantees almost complete impunity for all the acts I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite understandable that people flee from this situation, as the Karen population has been doing for several years and, as we are today reporting in the resolution, the Rohingya people has also done, being intercepted in Thailand.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I noted during my visit that both Thailand and the international community have assumed a disturbing attitude of submission to the junta. For example, many lawyers associations, opposition parties, refugees and political prisoners have alerted us to the terrible consequences that would befall the Burmese people if the international community and, in particular, the European Union were to support and endorse the sham elections that have been called by the SPDC for 2010. They warn us that this would give carte blanche to the junta to continue committing a wide range of crimes with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The political and ethnic groups that oppose the junta are very well organised and have drawn up an alternative constitution that is much more in line with the principles that we say we defend in the European Union. Therefore, for us to abandon them to their fate would be a mistake and would make us accomplices, whether active or passive, to the Burmese dictatorship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Burma, a country known for its wonderful Buddhist temples which abound in gold, is also a prison for thousands of Burmese. They live in one of the biggest political regimes in the world, from which they try to escape – to the USA, Australia, Canada and to European countries and their neighbours. After adopting resolutions calling for the release of thousands of political prisoners, including many opposition leaders and with a Nobel Prize laureate foremost among them, and after protests from international organisations against the conscription of children in Burma, who are then forced to work and are denied proper care, today we are discussing the problem of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">During their flight from this Burmese hell, thousands of people – members of the Muslim minority – have been captured in their boats in Thai territorial waters, towed into international waters and left without navigational equipment or food supplies, and some have been imprisoned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Muslim ethnic minority is also being persecuted by the ruling military regime in Burma. This includes incidents of denial of citizens’ rights, imprisonment, limited access to education, barriers to marriage, restrictions on free movement, and the destruction of mosques, churches and other places of worship. Although we should appreciate the permission granted by the Thai authorities for the temporary stay of refugees there, and also the declaration of the Prime Minister of Thailand in which he has announced an investigation, recent events are nevertheless an obvious example of the violation of human rights by the Thais.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we endorse the resolution which, however, does not alter the human tragedies in the region, where the background to the conflicts is not only the inhumane military regime and religious conflicts, but also the interests of various forces. It is therefore necessary to oppose more effectively both the military junta and the separatist tendencies of groups which persecute people who profess a different faith. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is regrettable that the Thai authorities have resorted to indefensible measures, all the more so because Thailand is known as a state which respects human rights and which takes in many refugees. The Prime Minister has stated that these events will be investigated and that those who behaved improperly towards the Burmese boat refugees will be punished. Let us hope that these pledges will be fulfilled. On the other hand, it is not the first time we have discussed the brazen and inadmissible conduct of the Burmese regime. I think that the European Union should take stricter measures and, certainly, we expect not just words but actions on the part of the larger states.

<p class="contents">Thailand hosts approximately 140 000 refugees in nine camps along the border. More than one million Myanmar citizens constitute an important part of the workforce in Thailand in the agricultural sector, in textiles and in the tourism sector. The Rohingya boat people trapped in Thailand are part of the multi-faceted, forced or voluntary emigration from Myanmar. Moreover, Thailand has other refugee issues to settle as well, such as the Hmong people from Laos.</p>
<p class="contents">The complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive political, humanitarian, economic and social solution. The Commission is conducting an intensive debate with the international community and the Thai Government, in a search for possible solutions. </p>
<p class="contents">Recent political uncertainties in Thailand interrupted the dialogue with the Government on this issue, but that is temporary. Thus, the Commission expects that the EU’s initiative vis-à-vis the Government will result in a constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 January 2009, the EU Troika, at ambassador level in Bangkok, expressed its concerns to the Thai authorities. It welcomed the Thai Government’s intention to investigate the incidents fully, and to share its findings, and urged the Thai Government to treat boat people arriving in Thai waters according to international humanitarian and human rights standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the Government’s intention to allow the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees access to the boat people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission encourages the Thai Government to seek regional cooperation, involving also the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as the Rohingya issue and the other displacement issues mentioned earlier need a comprehensive response.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a sustainable solution cannot be the result of short-term security considerations, but must take into account long-term humanitarian, political and socio-economic concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that Thailand is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the Royal Thai Government has, in the past, displayed a measure of humanitarian concern. The Commission will continue to remind the Thai authorities to strictly adhere to international human rights standards as a prerequisite for any solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And the name of one of the murderers is Cesare Battisti.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to echo the regret expressed by President Napolitano of Italy at the decision made by Mr Lula, the Brazilian president, to grant political refugee status to the Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti, who was sentenced by the courts to life imprisonment for committing those four murders, during the ‘Years of Lead’.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that Battisti was found guilty not only by the Italian judiciary, but also by the French judiciary and by the European Court of Human Rights. This is an inexplicable and extremely serious act, which cannot and must not go unnoticed by the European institutions. We have a duty to the relatives of Battisti’s victims, but most importantly, we are also bound because the European Union has, for many years, determined an anti-terrorism strategy to guarantee citizens’ safety and to safeguard democratic institutions. To stand by and watch would thus be to thwart the efforts made over the years to fight side by side against an ever-present threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also hopes that Brazil will reconsider and think hard about what is a very delicate, but utterly rightful and legitimate request. Brazil is a great democratic country and has always enjoyed an excellent relationship with Europe and with Italy, which is precisely why we have been taken by surprise by this door slammed in our face. Indeed, for the sake of the friendship and respect that joins our countries, for the sake of the friendship and cooperation and partnership agreements linking Brazil and the European Union, whether politically or economically, the response of all parties must be decisive and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must unite behind the action of the Italian Government, which is using every legitimate form of political and diplomatic pressure and legal recourse so that justice may be done. The decision taken by Brazil conflicts appallingly with the image of the European Union, since it appears to presume that political persecution and torture is practised within one of its Member States. In short, we are dealing with an unacceptable situation which, above all, has no grounding in reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This man is a murderer: he has killed four people. He has also been found guilty by the Italian courts of other acts such as belonging to an armed group, possession of firearms – a serious crime in most European countries – and acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">This man has been found guilty by an Italian court. Yet we find that on 17 December, the Brazilian Government, a democratic government, has granted him political refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Mauro said, the European Union must express its solidarity with the Italian government and show Brazil, a friendly, democratic country, that a mistake has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brazilian authorities inform us that the matter is still awaiting an appeal before the federal supreme court, but it is lamentable that the case has proceeded in this manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be remembered that the European Court of Human Rights rejected Mr Battisti’s request for protection and that the European Union now bases its action on the respect of fundamental human rights, which is an essential component of the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, taking into consideration the bonds of friendship between the European Union and Brazil, the Brazilian authorities should be reminded that the EU is a good ally and friend and that we hope, in return, that they will not act in this manner, as has been the case in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now discussing an individual legal case that is currently being tried in court, in connection with which we have the gall to say that we will stand up for the principle of the rule of law. Where I come from, one of the most fundamental principles of the rule of law is that a parliament does not interfere in individual court cases.</p>
<p class="contents">My group and I think that it is quite wrong to discuss an ongoing individual court case in a parliament. Unfortunately, this is not even the first or the last time, because we will soon be voting on the Medina report, which does the exact same thing. In an ongoing copyright case against Pirate Bay in a Swedish court, Parliament commented on the question of guilt while the case was still in progress. I really hope that this does not become a habit because, if it does, it would be us here in Europe who would be opposing and resisting our own principles of the rule of law and that would be extremely unfortunate. Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">Sorry, I forgot to mention something important.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are not happy with how Brazil and Europe are handling extraditions and if we are not happy with how our laws are interpreted in national courts, we should change the laws so that they are the same for everyone. We should not barge in and try to influence an individual case. That is the job of the judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers, not of Parliament.

<p class="contents">In this way, Europe is undermining its anti-terrorism directives and losing all authority in the global strategy for combating terrorism. I wonder whether the same thing would have happened if it had been perhaps a German terrorist from the Red Army Faction? Europe is, however, saying to Brazil that to fail to extradite a common criminal and communist like Battisti, who today even in prison dares to mock his victims, would be to downgrade itself to a country of refuge for the worst criminals and terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">Such behaviour would call into question all partnership agreements and, I believe, participation in the G8. We must emphasise quite clearly: it is not acceptable to make agreements with terrorists. Terrorists, sentenced under lawful proceedings – because our country has a great legal system, where no one is tortured and proceedings are legitimate – must then serve their sentence to the very last day.

I apologise for the confusion, but in fact we are now amending paragraph 2. That may explain why there was some confusion. Could we switch the voting list around? I do apologise, but I have things down in the wrong order on my list. I was actually reading out the change I wanted to make to recital K, rather than to paragraph 2, so that is the one we will be voting on next. I do apologise for the confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment to paragraph 2, which should have been the one we took last time, is: ‘Believes that a military victory over the LTTE, as envisaged by the Government of Sri Lanka, will not obviate the need to find a political solution in order to ensure a lasting peace’. That is as it is on the voting list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to inform the Honourable Member that the Commission Communication on food prices in Europe was presented to the Council at its session on 19 January 2009. This Communication follows up on a request by the June 2008 European Council to investigate the causes of the sharp increase in food prices following the even stronger rise in commodity prices.</p>
<p>The Communication reviews recent developments in agricultural commodities and food prices. It proposes, in particular, ways of improving the functioning of the food chain in Europe, setting out a work programme to improve its functioning. In addition, a need to balance the global supply and demand for food and to remove barriers in international trade is also, inter alia, noticed.</p>
<p>The Presidency considers that the Council's discussions were useful in giving Members of the Council the opportunity to exchange views on this important issue. During the course of the discussions, a number of views were expressed. Several delegations, for instance, raised the weak position of producers in the face of big retail chains and the need to reflect price decreases throughout the whole food supply chain.</p>
<p>Most delegations agreed on the need to monitor closely the market, and the Commission undertook to report back on this issue by the end of 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1048"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the continuation of the humanitarian crisis in the North-East of the Central African Republic (CAR). The Council is also aware of the need to create conditions in this area (CAR) which are favourable to the voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons, and to the reconstruction and the economic and social development of the region.</p>
<p>For this reason, the EU provides many different types of support to the Central African Republic, just as it does to Chad. The ESDP operation EUFOR Chad/RCA is one part of this multidimensional response. Action by the Commission in support of development cooperation, as well as the provision of humanitarian aid, offer additional support.</p>
<p>The EU operation EUFOR Chad/RCA had already made a considerable contribution to the stabilisation of the region, together with the UN mission MINURCAT as well as UNAMID in Darfur. EUFOR Chad/RCA in particular provided protection for refugees, displaced persons and humanitarian staff.</p>
<p>EUFOR Chad/RCA is a military bridging operation for twelve months and will end on 15 March 2009. The Council has underlined the importance of full deployment of the United Nations Mission in Chad and CAR (MINURCAT), approved by Resolution 1861 (2009) of the UN Security Council when the EUFOR mandate expires. Full deployment of MINURCAT is key to providing an effective response to the non military threats of banditry and crime.</p>
<p>Against this background, and having consulted the Central African authorities, the Council has insisted that all steps be taken to ensure that arrangements on the follow-up to the EU's operation be put in place, including through a United Nations operation, in accordance with Article 10 of Resolution 1778.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1051"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The fight against child labour is a core element of the European Union's human rights agenda and needs to be tackled at all levels and in different areas of action. The EU is pursuing a comprehensive approach to the elimination of all forms of child labour, covering the political, trade and development governance dimensions and actions with regard to the alleviation of poverty, the labour market, the social dialogue and social protection, with an emphasis on free and universal primary education.</p>
<p>The Czech Presidency intends to initiate discussions on a number of issues related to child protection. The Presidency will focus in particular on active police cooperation in searches for missing children, improved use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) for these purposes and joint action to combat illegal content on the Internet. Furthermore, the Czech Presidency will follow up on the activities of the French Presidency as well as on the conclusions of the Council concerning the Child Alert project. Child protection was the topic of an informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs ministers in Prague on 15/16 January and will also be discussed at the ministerial conferences "Safer Internet for Children" and "Children Friendly Europe", both taking place in April.</p>
<p>As regards child labour, based on the conclusions of the GAERC from May 2008, the European Commission is working on a report aimed at outlining the existing measures available for combating child labour; CZ PRES is awaiting its results.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission plans to submit a revision of the Council framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography to the Council in March 2009. The Czech Presidency is prepared to launch actively the negotiations of the respective initiative, which aims to create a more effective instrument for fighting against the sexual criminality concerning children. Furthermore, under the Czech Presidency a criminal law conference on “Protection of vulnerable victims and their standing in criminal proceedings” will be held in March 2009 in Prague.</p>
<p>In the Human Rights context, the aim of the Czech Presidency will be to improve the cooperation and partnership of EU institutions with non-governmental organisations and to contribute to the increased effectiveness of the relevant financial tools of the EU. The evaluation of the renewed European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is expected to take place in 2009. EIDHR includes actions aimed at preventing the recruitment of children for armed conflicts and at encouraging their release and reintegration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1053"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council Presidency is engaged in regular ministerial meetings and summits at Head of State level, with a range of third countries, including the US, China and India. At these meetings topics of mutual interest, including financial services are discussed and a common understanding is sought, where possible. Nevertheless, in the absence of a proposal from the Commission the Council is not in a position to adopt any legislative act. The current financial crisis makes the meetings with partners on the global level utmost important.</p>
<p>As regards the relation to the US the importance of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) should be stressed. It was established in 2007 to oversee the EU-US framework on transatlantic economic integration, this covers i.a. integration of the financial markets.</p>
<p>In addition, for several years the European Commission has been developing regular dialogues in the area of financial services regulation and, in some cases, macroeconomic dialogues with key economic partners. These started with the EU-US regulatory dialogue in 2002 and the EU-China dialogue followed in 2005 and the EU-India dialogue in 2006.</p>
<p>The Council does not participate in these dialogues, but monitors progress through the Financial Services Committee and the Economic and Financial Committee. Where appropriate the Council is briefed by the Commission on progress and has an informal exchange of views.</p>
<p>Finally, I recall that the G 20, including the US, China and India, held an initial meeting in Washington on November 15, 2008 to meet the serious challenges to the world economy and financial markets posed by the current crisis. The Council was represented in this meeting by the Presidency. The G 20 Heads of State agreed an ambitious action plan for measures to be taken both in the short and medium term to improve international financial regulation. This process will continue - the next meeting is already planned for April 2 this year - and this work will probably set the basis for the most important international platform for better regulation and supervision of the global financial services market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1055"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The recent Russia-Ukraine gas dispute has underlined the importance of strengthening the Union's energy policy. The CZ PRES has placed energy on the top of its three main political priorities long before the vulnerability of EU in terms of energy dependency was once again highlighted by the disruption of supplies. As Prime Minister Topolánek said clearly two weeks ago in Budapest at the Nabucco summit, the common energy policy for Europe is an ultimate need. It is now the task of the CZ PRES to use the momentum and political will generated by the crisis to bring the most pressing short-, medium- and long-term measures into being to prevent major supply disruptions in the future, and improve our ability to cope with the consequences should the need arise. An Extraordinary meeting of the Energy Council took place on 12 January and identified a set of measures that need to be taken in this respect.</p>
<p>As for long-term strategic measures – diversification of supply routes, suppliers and sources is an answer. Be it Nordstream, Nabucco, Southstream or LNG terminals, diversification is beneficial in terms in lowering our energy dependency and thus strengthening the bargaining position of EU vis-à-vis its partners.</p>
<p>As for medium-term measures, missing energy infrastructure and interconnections should be identified and work on them should be accelerated. European internal energy market will never work unless crossborder transfers are easily possible. The same goes for European solidarity. Problems of energy islands need to be tackled. The precondition for that is to mobilise necessary financial resources, i.e. via EIB or EBRD. The Presidency will strive that priority is given to energy infrastructure projects within the frame of the European economic recovery plan.</p>
<p>Last but not least, short-terms emergency measures should enable us to assist Member States in need. The examples of Slovakia and Bulgaria pointed sharp to the necessity to enhance bilateral and regional solidarity arrangements.</p>
<p>Several other useful measures have been identified, such as improved transparency as regards gas flows, demand and storage volumes both in member states and supply /transit countries followed by the installation of the reliable metering system. The Early Warning Mechanism should be assessed and extended to the transit countries.</p>
<p>The revision of the Directive on the Safeguard of Security of natural gas supply can play important role too. All these measures will strengthen EU and thus enable us to talk with one voice to our energy suppliers.</p>
<p>The Union's energy policy is based on the Action Plan adopted by the European Council in March 2007. Work on implementing this Action Plan is underway. It will be further enhanced in the light of the Commission's Second Strategic Energy Review which was submitted to the Council in November 2008, and which focuses in particular on energy security and the need for solidarity.</p>
<p>The Council will review the situation on 19 February and decide on further concrete measures set out in the Second Strategic Energy Review, as well as follow up on the measures agreed on 12 January. This work will provide the basis for the European Council in March to agree on the responses which are necessary if the Union will pursue the aim of developing a common energy policy and in particular if it is to enhance its energy security.</p>
<p>Another important element of the common energy policy is energy efficiency. In this area, the Council will address the various legislative proposals which the Commission has recently submitted, together with the Second Strategic Energy Review, namely the recast proposal on the energy performance of buildings, the recast proposal on energy efficiency labelling of energy related products, and the proposal on the fuel efficiency labelling of tyres.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1057"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is committed to respect fully the principle of subsidiarity. It will continue to ensure, in conformity with Article 5 of the TEC, that any Community action will only be taken if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States.</p>
<p>In considering any proposal for action at the Community level, the Council examines not just the content of the proposal, but also assesses whether the proposal respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Council will not agree to any proposal where it considers that this is not the case.</p>
<p>This is no different in the areas of education and social affairs and private law highlighted by the Honourable Member. This is moreover the case as, in both these areas, the treaties provide that action by the Community is aimed at supporting and complementing the activities of the Member States. In particular, the Council is vigilant to ensure that Community action in the area of education respects the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of the educational systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1059"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council attaches importance to territorial cohesion as one of key aspects of Cohesion policy aiming at addressing territorial imbalances in economic, social and environmental development within the European Union. It recognises the importance of Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013 in enabling Member States to take into account the territorial dimension. The Commission’s Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion of 6 October 2008 is currently under the public discussion, so the Council has not yet reached a final position on its content. Preliminary outputs of this public debate will be presented during the informal meeting of Ministers in charge of regional development taking place in Mariánské Lázně (the Czech Republic) in April 2009.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an interim report was drawn up by the French Presidency and is publicly available<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The main findings of this interim report were to confirm broad support for the following broad objectives of:</p>
<p>- a reduction in disparities between regions in terms of development;</p>
<p>- sustainable and balanced development of the whole of EU territory, taking into account the specific characteristics of individual regions so as to ensure fair living conditions throughout the Union;</p>
<p>- promotion of the principle that each territory should have a minimum level of access to major transport infrastructure, new information and communication technologies, and the main services of general interest such as health and education;</p>
<p>- support for the need for both Community and national sectoral policies to take greater account of their varying impact on territories, and for better links with other European policies with a territorial impact.</p>
<p>However, according to the report, some delegations expressed their concerns about particular aspects of the Green Paper.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to follow the issue closely, and in particular as a follow-up of the public debate on the Commission's Green paper. It will be able to adopt a formal position once the Commission comes forward with any proposals in the light of this debate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of labelling of origin is currently under discussion in both the Council and European Parliament on the basis of the European Commission's Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with current Community legislation, origin labelling is required</p>
<p>-	in cases where consumers might be misled on the true origin or provenance of the foodstuffs, and</p>
<p>-	in application of specific rules such as those for fruit and vegetables, beef, wine, honey, fish, and imported poultry.</p>
<p>With respect to the labelling of the country of origin or place of provenance of a food, the basic requirement in the proposed new legislation remains the same. Labelling would therefore remain voluntary, unless failure to provide such information might mislead the consumer. In this case labelling becomes mandatory. The Commission proposal also aims to clarify the conditions under which Member States may adopt national rules on origin labelling.</p>
<p>This approach is based on the view that food labelling, including indications on origin, is primarily an instrument of consumer information. Origin labelling cannot by itself be regarded as a tool for contributing to food safety, as it does not address the causes of contaminations such as that referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>All food and feed legally placed on the market in the European Union must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from. In order to safeguard consumer confidence, this basic principle must continue to be the cornerstone of EU food safety policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU has demonstrated its commitment to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) through the "EU Agenda for Action on MDGs", endorsed by the European Council in June 2008. This Agenda for Action sets a number of milestones which will contribute to this objective, and provides examples of EU action in support of the commitments already made by the EU.</p>
<p>The EU Agenda identifies priority actions in key areas such as education, environment, health, water and sanitation, agriculture, pro-poor growth, infrastructure and gender equality. Action is also needed to enhance the integration of cross-cutting issues in all sectors. The EU has proposed to its partners in development to share this Agenda for Action, which should also be taken into account in the context of the joint Africa-EU Strategy and its different partnerships adopted at the Lisbon Summit. Ownership of the agenda by partner countries will represent a key factor in ensuring its success.</p>
<p>In light of progress made in some countries and areas, the EU is convinced that all the MDGs can still be attained in all regions of the world, provided that concerted and sustained action be taken between now and 2015. However, the EU is seriously concerned about the effects of the trend in many countries and regions, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, in terms of achievement of the MDGs.</p>
<p>New challenges have emerged that may undermine the achievement of the MDGs: global financial crisis, high and volatile food and commodity prices. The emergence of new actors has made the aid architecture more complex. The priority given to combating climate change and to strengthening developing countries’ capacity to adapt has been continuously growing, leading to the new increased collective effort by way of additional aid. A renewed commitment from the international community in support of the Monterrey Consensus and the readiness to take further action are required if these new challenges are to be tackled.</p>
<p>In its Guidelines for the participation in the Doha Conference on Financing for Development, the EU stated that the poorest countries and countries in situation of fragility should not be the victims of the current crisis, which must not undermine the implementation of commitments in support of the Monterrey consensus and the achievement of the MDGs.</p>
<p>Against this background, the EU will maintain its leading role in providing financial support towards achievement of the MDGs including to maintain its ODA commitments and will make every effort to ensure an ambitious action oriented response by the wider international community. The Council will discuss these issues in detail during the GAERC meeting in May 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1068"></a>

<p>The respect and promotion of human rights and of the freedom of opinion and expression is a core element of the EU's external relations policy.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 23 June 2008, the Council called upon the Cuban Government to improve the human rights situation by, inter alia, releasing unconditionally all political prisoners, including those who were detained and sentenced in 2003. It also called on the Cuban Government to facilitate access of international humanitarian organizations to Cuban prisons. The Council has also "reaffirmed its determination to pursue a dialogue with the Cuban authorities as well as with representatives of civil society and democratic opposition, in accordance with EU policies, in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards a pluralist democracy. The EU will continue to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, and will press the Cuban Government to grant freedom of information and expression including access to the Internet.</p>
<p>The dialogue with the Cuban authorities was re-opened at the ministerial meeting of 16 October 2008. It provided an opportunity for the EU to outline to the Cuban Government its views on democracy, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. At the same time the EU maintains its contacts with the democratic opposition.</p>
<p>The evolution of human rights and of the freedom of opinion in Cuba will be an important element in the evaluation of the EU's relations with Cuba including the effectiveness of the political dialogue process.</p>
<p>As concerns individual cases, the Council follows them closely and raises them with the Cuban authorities at every available opportunity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1070"></a>

<p>The issue of electoral participation is a matter for each individual Member State and information campaigns concerning elections to the European Parliament are organised in each Member State in accordance with national legislation. It would not therefore be appropriate for the Council to take a position on this issue nor to undertake any particular initiatives.</p>
<p>However the European Parliament, Council and Commission in their political declaration of 22 October 2008, entitled "Communicating Europe in Partnership" underlined the utmost importance of improving communication generally on EU issues in order to enable European citizens to exercise their right to participate in the democratic life of the Union.</p>
<p>The Council, for its part, in its conclusions on “Communicating Europe in Partnership", has pointed out that “occasions such as direct elections to the European Parliament provide good opportunities to enhance communication with citizens on EU issues and to inform and encourage their participation in the political debate”.</p>
<p>In accordance with that declaration, the Council recognises the importance of addressing the communication challenge on EU issues in partnership between Member States and the other institutions to ensure effective communication with, and objective information to, the widest possible audience at the appropriate level.</p>
<p>Under the declaration the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission highlighted the “European Parliament elections” as one of the inter-institutional communication priorities for 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0002"></a>

<p>In December 2008 the EU reaffirmed its policy of stepping up its bilateral relations with Israel, in the context of the adoption of a new instrument, planned to replace the present Action Plan from April 2009. The guidelines for reinforcing the political dialogue with Israel include: more bilateral summits at all levels; more frequent Israeli access to the Union's Political and Security Committee; facilitation of the hearing of Israeli experts by the Council's groups and committees; systematisation and enlargement of the informal strategic consultations; encouragement of Israeli alignment with the CFSP; enabling of cooperation at ground level in the area of the Union's European Security and Defence Policy; and encouragement of Israel's participation and involvement in multilateral bodies such as the UN.

<p>On 12 January, the Central Elections Committee of Israel decided to ban the two Arab political parties which sit in the Israeli Parliament (Knesset), the United Arab List-Ta'al and Balad, from taking part in the forthcoming elections in February. This decision, which excludes Israeli citizens of Arab origin from political life, deprives the Arab community in Israel of their democratic civil rights and is a flagrant violation of civil liberties and the right to freedom of expression. This ban on Arab parties is part and parcel of the Israeli Government's criminal war against the Palestinian people and the brutal slaughter of thousands of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, including hundreds of children.</p>

<p>The Council fully shares the preoccupations of the Honourable Member on the dire situation of civilians in the Gaza strip.</p>
<p>The European Union deeply deplores the loss of life during this conflict, particularly the civilian casualties. The Council has reminded all parties to the conflict, most recently in the conclusions of its meeting on 26 January, to fully respect human rights and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Council continues to raise its serious human rights concerns with Israel in the framework of all high level meetings, most recently during the EU Foreign Ministers' dinner with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on 21 January 2009.</p>
<p>The issues of the EU-Israel Association agreement and of the upgrading of the relations with Israel, raised by the Honourable Members, were not addressed in the conclusions of the Council meeting of 26 January. In general, the Council considers it vital to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open and that positive persuasion and dialogue is the most effective approach for conveying messages from the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the specific issue of the ban on two Arab parties taking part in elections in Israel, the Council has taken note of a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Israel which on 21 January 2009 overturned a decision by the Central Elections Committee banning the "National Democratic Assembly - Balad" and the "United Arab List and Arab Movement for Change" political party lists from standing in the upcoming elections to the Israeli parliament (Knesset) scheduled to take place on 10 February 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council fully shares the concerns of the Honourable Member about the low number of teachers – and other key professionals such as doctors or nurses – in many developing countries.</p>
<p>To achieve universal primary education by 2015 is the second of the Millennium Development Goals. In line with this objective, the Union has identified education as one of the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty eradication in the European Consensus on Development. Where circumstances permit, the EU also encourages the use of general or sectoral budget support for education budgets.</p>
<p>The issue of lack of teachers and their low wages is a particular problem for developing countries, where the empowerment of teachers is critical to the provision of education in general. In accordance with the principle of ownership, it is for the partner countries to establish their own development priorities and to allocate the share of the budget to be dedicated to education accordingly. At the same time, teachers' wages should be set at a reasonable level in comparison with the average national wages within the public sector.</p>
<p>As far as the IMF is concerned, the Member States of the Union are just some of the 185 countries which are members. Most of these are developing countries, which of course also have a say on how the IMF operates. In the event that member countries experience difficulties in financing their balance of payments, the IMF is a fund that can be tapped to facilitate recovery. A policy program supported by financing is designed by the national authorities in close cooperation with the IMF, and continued financial support is conditional on the effective implementation of this program.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council, together as co-legislator with the European Parliament, adopted on 18 December 2007 Directive 2007/65/EC (the "Audiovisual Media Services Directive") which updated the legal framework for television broadcasting and audiovisual media services in the EU<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Article 3b of this Directive prohibits broadcasts inciting hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>The scope of this Directive, and its predecessor the "Television without Frontiers Directive" can include programmes broadcast by organisations established outside the EU, such as Al Manar and Al Aqsa, but it is necessary that they use satellite facilities "appertaining to a Member State". It is on this basis, the Council understands, that the regulatory authority of France issued an order in January 2009 against the broadcasting of Al Aqsa on Eutelsat. However, the situation of Nilesat and Arabsat, on which Al Manar is still available, different due to the non-usage of EU satellite facilities. An appropriate EU response is therefore more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Council is aware that the Commission is exploring ways to highlight this issue in its political dialogue with both Egypt and the Lebanon. The Council will similarly seek to ensure that this question is addressed in its dealings with these countries.</p>
<p>Radicalisation and recruitment has been one of the highly important EU security issues for several years. Specific EU documents have been prepared and approved to deal with this phenomenon, including strategic documents like the European Union Counter Terrorism Strategy and its Action Plan, the EU Strategy to counter radicalisation and recruitment and its Action Plan.</p>
<p>The EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator has been encouraging the development of measures to counter radicalisation in Europe and elsewhere, which is one of the main threats facing Europe as recognised in the Report on the Implementation of the European Security Strategy delivered to the last European Summit. A revised strategy and action plan to counter radicalisation was adopted by the JHA Council on 27/28 November 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 1997, the European Union recommended that Russia sign a border agreement with Estonia without delay. On 18 May 2005, the States signed a border agreement from which Russia withdrew its signature because the Russian authorities did not agree with the unilateral declaration added by the Estonian Parliament referring to the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 and the occupation after the Second World War. At the end of August 2006, Russia proposed to Estonia that negotiations begin on new border agreements in which it would be stated that there were no territorial claims between the parties and that all previous agreements dealing with border matters ceased to apply. In an interview given to the news agency Interfax on 25 December 2007, Estonia's Foreign Minister, Urmas Paet, called on the Russian authorities to ratify the border agreement; at the same time, Estonia welcomed the entry into force of the border agreements between Russia and Latvia on 18 December 2007. Any progress towards placing relations between the EU and Russia on a firm footing in the form of treaties is in the interest of the whole EU and of Estonia too. The entry into force of the border agreement between Latvia and Russia could encourage Russia also to proceed with the border agreement between Estonia and Russia.</p>

<p>The Council has for many years, and in particular since Estonia joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, insisted with Russia on the importance of the signature and ratification of the border agreement with Estonia for EU-Russia relations.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the signature of the border agreement in May 2005 and the ratification by the Estonian parliament in June 2005, and was looking forward to the ratification of the agreement also by Russia and its early entry into force.

<p>As the matter remains unresolved, the Council will continue to insist with Russia on the importance of the signature and ratification of the border agreement for EU-Russia relations, and regrets that aspects of history have led to difficulties.</p>
<p>Although border issues essentially fall within the competence of Member States, the Council more generally underlines the importance it attaches to the legal certainty of the external borders of the Member states of the EU and neighbour countries, as well as to stable relations between EU Member States and Russia. In this regard, the demarcation of all EU-Russia borders should be completed according to international standards as set out in the Road Map on Freedom, Security and Justice, adopted at the EU-Russia Moscow Summit in May 2005 as an instrument for the implementation of the Common Spaces created in May 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0022"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU's approach towards Cuba was set out in the Council conclusions adopted on 23 June 2008. Discussions in the Council on how to pursue the implementation of these conclusions continue. At a ministerial meeting on 16 October in Paris, the EU and Cuba agreed on the resumption of a comprehensive political dialogue, including political, economic, scientific, cultural and especially human rights issues, on a reciprocal, non-discriminatory and result-orientated basis. The Council will continue to pursue the objectives set out in the 1996 Common Position and its two-pronged approach: dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sectors of Cuban society in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards pluralist democracy. The Common Position remains at the core of the EU policy towards Cuba and in particular insistence on a real and measurable improvement of the human rights situation from the Cubans and is the unconditional release of all political prisoners.</p>
<p>The Council continues to monitor closely the situation in Venezuela, and pursues its policy of contacts at all levels with the authorities and the institutions as well as with the opposition in order to contribute to a national dialogue and to prevent moves by any side which might endanger the stability of the country or erode democracy and the state of law. This strategy seems to be fruitful. Both sides in Venezuela acknowledged the value of our contributions.</p>
<p>With regard to Colombia, the Council welcomes and supports continued clear improvements in the security and respect of human rights in the country, including through the recent adoption of legislation. At the same time, the Council remains concerned at the situation in Colombia, and in particular at crimes, such as the recent murder of the husband of Mrs. Quilcué, defender of the rights of the indigenous population. The Colombian authorities have regularly been urged to provide the appropriate means for a successful implementation of the justice and peace law. The Council also reiterates its call to the illegally armed groups to release all their prisoners, to end violence and to respect human rights. The EU will continue its very regular discussions with the Colombian authorities, and will maintain its support for the disarmament, justice and peace process.</p>
<p>It is premature to speculate on the approach of the new US administration towards Latin America. However, the early announcements on the lifting of restrictions on family and other visits as well as on the transfer of money in relation to Cuba are encouraging. These changes respond clearly to requests by Cubans both on the island as well as in the US. These measures are in line with the EU's approach, as set out in the Common Position of 1996. The Council intends to maintain a regular dialogue with the US on Latin America.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0033"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that currently the situation in Gaza has to be improved by the full implementation of UN SCR. 1860 by both parties, which implies foremost the free and unhindered passage of humanitarian aid to and within Gaza. A durable ceasefire is needed which has to be based on a mechanism taking into account Israel’s security needs by preventing arms smuggling on the one hand, and enabling reconstruction and economic development in Gaza by opening border crossings on the other hand.</p>
<p>The Council believes, however, that the Gaza crisis has to be seen in its broader context. On the basis of existing policy lines, as elaborated in successive Council conclusions, the Council pursues an active policy in support of both addressing the urgent challenges in the aftermath of the Gaza war as well as the medium-term actions required to renew the prospects for peace in the region. In this regard the Council believes inner-Palestinian dialogue and the resumption of the peace process to be crucial elements.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority has proved to be a reliable and efficient partner, preventing further escalation of the situation in the West Bank. The Council strongly encourages inter-Palestinian reconciliation behind President Mahmoud Abbas which is key for peace, stability and development and supports the mediation efforts of Egypt and the Arab League in this respect.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that peace in the region can only be achieved by the conclusion of the peace process leading to an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, living side by side with Israel in peace and security. In order to maintain this perspective the Council reiterates its call on both parties to comply with their obligations under the Roadmap. Considering the Arab Peace Initiative to be a solid and appropriate basis for a comprehensive resolution of the Israeli-Arab conflict, the EU is committed to work with the Quartet, the new US-administration and Arab partners to this end. The Council welcomes the immediate nomination and engagement of the new US-special envoy for the Middle East, Mitchell, in the region and is ready to closely cooperate with him.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0037"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has warmly congratulated President Obama on his inauguration. The Commission welcomes his initial moves to close the detention camp at Guantanamo, reinforce US engagement in the Middle East peace process, and reach out to the Islamic world.</p>
<p>The recovery of the global economy will be the top priority in the months to come. The Commission must make sure that EU and US policies are mutually reinforcing, and boost the transatlantic economy by perpetuating and improving the Transatlantic Economic Council. The Commission should co-operate to counter the resurgence of protectionist voices. The Commission wants to work closely with the US on climate change, above all to engage the emerging economies and achieve real progress in the multilateral negotiations before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The Commissioner for External Relations and Neighbourhood Policy has written to Secretary of State Clinton setting out the Commission's views on the immediate external relations priorities: a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, the need to address state-building in Afghanistan in its regional context, and how to promote stability in the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood. The Commission must also promote, together, an equitable architecture of international co-operation that embraces the newly emerging powers.</p>
<p>Efforts to set the EU-US relationship on a new footing will build up towards the next EU-US Summit in mid-2009. Once the Commission has established a good dialogue with the new US counterparts on the priority issues, the Commission will also be taking a look at whether the institutional framework of EU-US relations – the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 – needs to be updated so as better to serve our mutual objectives.</p>
<p>The EU will have to live up to US expectations by demonstrating that the EU can be an effective partner. The EU must speak with one voice. In that respect, a rapid entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty would deliver a major boost to transatlantic relations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1060"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission and the EU Foreign Ministers have been approached by their Irish counterpart in December with a request to enhance the Commission's relations with the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p>1.	Economic and Financial Matters, Trade, Customs Issues</p>
<p>2.	Social Affairs</p>
<p>3.	Energy, Environment, Transport, Science and Technology</p>
<p>4.	Human rights, good governance and rule of law.</p>
<p>The Commission organised the first sub-committee (on Human rights, good governance and rule of law) with the Palestinian Authority already in December 2008.</p>
<p>In addition, last December for the first time the Council organised the first political dialogue at the level of senior officials, in addition to the existing political dialogue at ministerial level.</p>
<p>These are important first steps towards deeper bilateral relations. They demonstrate the commitment of both parties to exploring various avenues towards achieving deeper and broader bilateral relations in the light of the joint efforts aiming to create a Palestinian State.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomed the opening for signature of the international Convention on Cluster Munitions by Member States of the United Nations (UN) in Oslo on 3 December 2008. In particular, the Commission applauded the immediate adherence to the Convention by 95 of the 193 UN Member States and the swift ratification by four States. This is indeed promising and the Commission hopes that all countries, both those affected by cluster munitions and users and producers of these weapons, will sign and ratify the Convention as soon as possible, so that it can enter into force without delay.</p>
<p>The Convention banning cluster munitions is a milestone towards enhancing the security of victims of conflicts in many regions across the world. The Commission sees the Convention on Cluster Munitions primarily as a humanitarian instrument. At the same time, the Commission realises that such a Convention also has disarmament and defence implications for States, areas on which the European Community and thus the Commission have no specific competence. The question of signing and ratifying this Convention is up to the Member States.</p>
<p>In the context of its development co-operation and assistance the Commission does have an important role to play in supporting effective implementation of the Convention.

<p>(EN) The Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid travelled to the region last week and on Monday 26 January, announced €32 million emergency assistance to the population in Gaza, to be used for food, shelters, health, and psychological support.</p>
<p>Already earlier this month, the Commission has provided more than €10 million, in response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. This comes on top of more than €73 million of such aid during 2008. It is focused on food, emergency shelter repairs and further medical support. These are all areas identified as priorities in the United Nations Relief and Work Agency's (UNRWA) Flash Appeal launched on 30 December 2008.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you probably know, the Commission provides all the fuel to the Gaza power plant. For the sake of better coordination, the Commission has placed a full time official in the Joint Liaison Centre set up by the Israeli government, to help with the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue to be a predictable donor to UNRWA. This year, the Commission will again provide an early contribution of €66 million to the Agency’s General Fund, and will top up the above amounts with humanitarian and food assistance, as appropriate.</p>
<p>During the coming weeks, the Commission will be called upon to contribute to the emergency relief effort, and later on also to reconstruction work in Gaza. In this respect, the Commission expects that an international donors’ conference, tentatively planned in Egypt on 28 February, will focus on the most urgent needs of the population. The Commission intends to play a major role throughout all this process.</p>
<p>As to your second question on a possible suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel, the Commission recognises the frustration of those who feel that things have gone from bad to worse in particular over the last year. On balance, however, it is the Commission’s judgement (which reflects the views of the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in the External Relations Council) that measures such as suspension of our Association Agreement would make the Israeli authorities less rather than more responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting settlement.</p>
<p>With regard to the upgrading process, the Commission always stated that this is being influenced by developments on the ground. For the moment, the Commission is entirely dedicated to pursue another priority, i.e. the situation in Gaza, especially after the temporary ceasefire of 18 January. The population in Gaza has immediate basic needs the Commission will have to cater for.</p>
<p>The Commission considers therefore that the time is not right to deal with this question and will come back to it when circumstances allow us to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0009"></a>

<p>(EN) Respect for human rights is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and an essential element of the EU’s foreign policy. Consequently, the Commission attaches great importance to the protection of human rights in its relations with Israel.</p>
<p>In its meetings with Israeli authorities, the Commission expresses its concerns with regard to the human rights situation of the Palestinians, and in particular in Gaza, and continues to remind Israel of its obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>On balance, however, it is the Commission’s judgement (which reflects the views of the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in the External Relations Council) that measures such as suspension of our Association Agreement would make the Israeli authorities less rather than more responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting settlement.</p>
<p>This being said, the Commission is following closely the investigations into the conduct of both parties during the most recent conflict which are currently being carried out.</p>
<p>In response to the outbreak of the Gaza crisis, EU Foreign Ministers held an emergency meeting in Paris on 30 December to develop proposals - the Paris Declaration - to bring the conflict to an end. Shortly after the Council meeting, the EU Troika to the region with the objective of achieving an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the crisis, and under the instructions of the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, the Commission has concentrated all its contacts and discussions with Israel on the best way to deal with the crisis. Meetings on other topics have actually been put on hold due to the priority given to the Gaza issue. This has been explained to the Israeli authorities who have understood that Gaza takes precedent to any other matter for discussion at the moment.</p>
<p>Following the establishment of a temporary ceasefire, the Commission is now working to make this ceasefire sustainable. At the same time, the Commission is contributing to improving the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian population, and is enabling the Gaza power plant to operate, however insufficiently.</p>
<p>Last week’s General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to develop an EU work plan. This will focus first and foremost on immediate humanitarian relief for the population of Gaza, and will include support to the prevention of illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition, the sustained re-opening of crossing points, rehabilitation and reconstruction and the resumption of the peace process.</p>
<p>The Commission's priority in its relations with Israel at the moment remains to be Gaza and in particular questions of access and provision of humanitarian aid. For all this matters, dialogue with Israel is essential.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0019"></a>

<p>(EN) 1.	The Strategic Partnership between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean - which will be celebrating this year its 10<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary - is articulated on the following objectives: intense political dialogue, the strengthening of democratic governance and the respect of human rights, support to integration processes including the establishment of a network of association agreements, and extensive cooperation to reduce poverty, social inequalities and improve educational levels.</p>
<p>These objectives are constantly adapted to new developments and global challenges, such as the impact of the current financial and economic crisis, the urgent need to tackle climate change and to address energy security.</p>
<p>The Commission will make use of forthcoming meetings, such as the Ministerial Meeting between the European Union and the Rio Group in Prague in May 2009, and preparations for the next Latin American, Caribbean and EU Summit (in 2010 in Spain) to address these issues.</p>
<p>Regarding Venezuela, our objective is to strengthen relations and to establish more regular, open, constructive and structured dialogue on areas of common interest through the development of the economic dialogue and the bilateral cooperation (40 million Euros earmarked for 2007-20013 for two priorities: modernization of the Venezuelan state and diversification of its economy).</p>
<p>Regarding Cuba, following the Council Conclusions in 2008, development cooperation has been resumed between the EC and Cuba. The EC cooperation will, in the short term, be done on an ad hoc basis and channelled through the UN agencies and European and local NGOs. One of the main objectives of this cooperation will be to support the efforts of reconstruction and rehabilitation after the passage of the hurricanes in 2008.</p>
<p>Cuba is the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean with whom the EU does not have a contractual framework. The Commission hopes that in the medium term it will be possible to normalise the relations with Cuba.</p>
<p>2.	The Commission is offering the Colombian Governement every possible assistance and solidarity in its efforts to secure the release of the hostages held by the FARC. However, in view of past experience, the Colombian Government has decided on this occasion to limit the involvement of other countries or Vatican institutions, and the Commission must respect this decision.</p>
<p>As regards the peace-building process, the Commission is dedicating 70% of our aid (more than EUR 160 million) specifically to peace-building, alternative and sustainable development and the fight against drugs. Furthermore, 20% of this assistance will be focused on enforcing the rule of law in Colombia, through judicial institutions and by promoting human rights, among other things. Without question, building peace and stability remains our primary objective in Colombia.</p>
<p>3.	The Commission maintains good and fluent contacts with the US Administration on Latin American issues. We have a regular political dialogue (twice a year) at the High Official EU troika level with the US, dealing specifically with Latin America and the Caribbean. We are convinced that we will continue this constructive dialogue and cooperation with the new Obama Administration.</p>
<p>President Obama has not yet made substantive statements on the future relationship with Latin America. But the first indications are positive, as demonstrated by the meeting he had a few weeks ago in his capacity as President elect, with President Calderon from Mexico. We have to wait to know more about President Obama’s strategy and engagement towards the region. Possible fields in which we could work for an enhanced cooperation between the US, the EU and Latin America could be the fight against drugs and organised crime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1047"></a>

<p>(FR) Social progress and the protection of workers’ rights are objectives that have always been central to the development of the European Union. That is why the policies contained in the existing Treaties on social affairs and the protection of workers’ rights have been strengthened in the Treaty of Lisbon and the decisive role of the social partners is very clearly recognised in the text.</p>
<p>Obviously, the context in which we are evolving determines the measures required in order to secure these objectives. Hence, the fundamental developments in our society, such as globalisation, development of new technologies, demographic changes and climate change have transformed the nature of social issues. These changes have prompted the European Union to establish the Lisbon Strategy, to adapt legislation, the European Social Fund (ESF) or the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), to develop the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) in order to continue to ensure that the European Union’s social values are appropriately maintained, while at the same time adjusting our instruments in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in July 2008, the Commission presented its renewed social agenda in order to adapt and strengthen our European social model in the face of all these changes. We have to give everyone the same chances to succeed in life through access to education, to health or social services, take action to support those people who are most disadvantaged, on the basis of solidarity, encourage social dialogue through the revised directive on European works councils and improve protection of the rights of temporary workers.</p>
<p>Today the whole of Europe is affected by an economic crisis which has led the Union to take exceptional measures with an economic recovery plan that clearly demonstrates the importance it attaches to protecting the most basic of workers’ rights, which is that of access to employment. Furthermore, the Commission has proposed extending the scope and increasing the flexibility of the eligibility criteria of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to enable it to give more effective help to workers affected by the crisis. At this stage and beyond these financial measures, it has clearly become urgent to carry through the reforms in progress in relation to flexicurity, active inclusion and pension schemes.</p>
<p>This context of crisis, therefore, only strengthens the Commission in its pursuit of social progress as well as the protection of workers’ rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1058"></a>

<p>(EN) The report to which the Honourable Member refers was drafted by the Danish Centre for Human Rights at the Commission's request.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that multiple discrimination is a social reality which should be addressed in an appropriate manner. However, the body of the proposal for a Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted by the Commission on 2 July 2008 contains no explicit provision prohibiting multiple discrimination.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this. First, the proposal concerns discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. Introducing a clause on multiple discrimination on other grounds too(such as gender or racial or ethnic origin) could be seen as going beyond the remit of the Directive. Alternatively, if multiple discrimination concerned only the four grounds of discrimination covered by the draft Directive, then such major forms of multiple discrimination as those involving gender, or racial or ethnic origin would not be tackled. Secondly, when it was preparing the abovementioned proposal, the Commission considered that this issue deserved further reflection.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposed that the non-discrimination governmental expert group set up recently should work on the issue of multiple discrimination. The tasks of the group, which was established by the Commission decision of 2 July 2008<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, are:</p>
<p>- to establish cooperation between the relevant Member State authorities and the Commission on issues relating to the promotion of equality and the fight against discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation;</p>
<p>to monitor the development of EU and national policies in this field; and</p>
<p>to foster the exchange of experience and good practice on issues of common interest relating to non-discrimination and the promotion of equality.</p>
<p>At the group's first meeting in November 2008, the Commission agreed with the group that it would address the issue of multiple discrimination. The Commission has also asked the European Network of Legal Experts in the field of Gender Equality to draft a report on the legal aspects of multiple discrimination with a specific focus on the gender dimension. That report is expected to be completed by June 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) It must be stated straightaway that the Commission does not have the information to which the honourable Member refers and according to which businesses, during this period of economic crisis, are apparently in the process of reducing costs, on a large scale, in the area of health and safety at work.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s concerns about the fact that cost cutting could lead to lower standards, it must be emphasised that at European Union level, the provisions relating to health and safety at work – that is those in the framework Directive 89/391/EEC and its specific directives – are legally binding. These directives must be transposed and implemented by Member States in their own national legal systems.</p>
<p>Consequently, any potential reduction in the standard of health and safety for workers in workplaces could not under any circumstances bring these standards below the minimum level required by the Community directives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission and the Bilbao Agency for Safety and Health at Work are constantly striving, even during this period of economic crisis, to make employers aware of the fact that, in economic terms, businesses that invest in health and safety for their workers achieve measurable results: a reduction in the cost of absenteeism, increased workers’ motivation and improved productivity and business competitiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0005"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the Community provisions on the coordination of social security schemes as contained in Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 and 574/72. In accordance with those provisions, a person who is solely employed in Denmark but resides in Sweden would normally be entitled to social security benefits in Denmark on equal terms with persons employed and residing in that country. A frontier worker would be entitled to receive sickness benefits in kind either in Denmark or in Sweden, as he or she chooses. However, the obligation to pay sickness cash benefits, which also covers sick pay from the employer (for example in the event of an accident that occurs while the worker is commuting), would fall on the Danish social security system. It would consequently be the employer's obligation to pay sick pay to the employee, even where he or she resides in Sweden.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's information, the way Denmark applies the coordinating regulations does not appear to be in compliance with Community law. This matter has been brought to the attention of the Swedish authorities who have written to their Danish colleagues with a view to resolving the matter.</p>
<p>In view of this development, the Commission feels confident that the matter will be resolved in a manner which is consistent with Community law.</p>

<p>(EN) Enhancing the energy performance of buildings is an important avenue towards reducing climate change and enhancing energy security and the competitiveness of the EU economy. The Commission has taken a wide range of measures to increase the energy efficiency in the building sector, such as legal measures, financial instruments and actions in order to disseminate information. One of the most important legal instruments in this field is Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings, of which the Commission is monitoring the implementation. In order to extend its scope and strengthen some of its provisions, the Commission recently presented a Proposal for recast.</p>
<p>As regards the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, it should be recalled that in all Member States the current legislation allows a broad range of energy efficiency and renewable energy interventions in buildings other than those serving housing purposes. For the latter, the current legislation foresees limited eligibility of expenditure on housing in the EU-12 depending on conditions relating to the financial allocation, the context of intervention, the type of housing, the zone and type of intervention.</p>
<p>In line with its Communication on the European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on 3 December 2008, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing. The modification would make all Member States eligible for an amount of up to 4% of the total ERDF allocation as regards expenditure on energy efficiency improvements and on the use of renewable energy in existing housing. The categories of eligible housing will be defined at national level, with the aim to support social cohesion.</p>
<p>Should the modification be adopted , then it is for Member States to decide whether they wish to re-programme their Structural Funds Operational Programmes in order to devote a greater share to energy efficiency investments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Measures need to be put in place within the EU to address the needs of women and girls who are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM).

<p>Can the Commission recommend to non-participating Member States that they consider such action plans and legislation outlawing this harmful practice? Such a law would send a clear signal to potential practitioners of this tradition that FGM is wholly unacceptable within the EU.

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that female genital mutilations (FGM) constitute a serious violation of women's and girls' fundamental rights and that all European countries should take strong measures to prevent such practices from happening both within and outside the EU.</p>
<p>All forms of female genital mutilation are associated with an increased risk of pyschological and physical damage including haemorrhage, infection, infertility, incontinence and mental health problems. Female genital mutilation is also a cause of obstetric complications to the mother and infant including stillbirths, infant death and long term disability. These practices are a serious violation of their fundamental right to physical and mental integrity, which is recognised in all Member States of the EU. Although the Commission does not have competence to propose legislation in this area, it is consistently making Community funding available under the Daphne III Programme to assist European non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and local or regional public authorities and institutions to combat FGM.</p>
<p>The Daphne Programme has in particular contributed to creating and supporting the European Network of NGOs fighting FGM (Euronet-FGM), which is the coordinator of the Daphne-funded project that the Honourable Member is referring to. This project is developing national plans of action (PoA) for the elimination of FGM in 15 EU and EEA Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece , Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) and is also exploring the situation of FGM in 10 new Member States. The project ends in June 2009 and a final conference will be organised near the end of the project in order to present, discuss and disseminate the national PoA, to sensitise the international community for the problem of FGM in Europe and for violence against migrant women and girls in general. The Commission will be present at this event and will urge Member States which have not yet developed action plans to learn from the project results and take necessary measure as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In its external assistance to third countries, the Commission has three polices in use against FGM. Firstly, The Commission brings women's empowerment, human rights and women's health issues in political and policy dialogue with partner governments. Secondly, the Commission supports advocacy and lobbying initiatives for the improvement of national legislation and the development of adequate national policies for the promotion and protection of women’s rights and the prohibition of harmful practices. Thirdly, the Commission supports capacity-building initiatives for government officials as well as advocacy and awareness-raising in all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently financing the following projects:</p>
<p>Under the "Investing in People" programme a project aiming at contributing to the abandonment in selected countries of social norms harmful to girls and women is financed in co-operation with the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).</p>
<p>In Burkina Faso, the Commission supports a Centre for women's well-being and prevention of FMG. The Centre focuses on prevention and on treatment of FGM consequences, as well as on awareness raising on women's rights.</p>
<p>The Commission will provide support to the justice sector in Nigeria, to a wider variety of non-State actors, to parliamentarians and to mass media. The action will contribute to increase public awareness, to sustain the domestic debate and to promote policy advocacy on key issues concerning good governance and human rights including FGM.</p>
<p>In Senegal, we support a project by the Senegalese association AFELP "Association Femmes Enfant Lutte Contre la Pauvreté" in partnership with the "Secours Populaire Français". The project helps women to fight for themselves against all forms of violence of which they are victims, as well as to help them combat damaging cultural practices and promote the principles of democracy.</p>
<p>Under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights the Commission is funding a project in Somalia, "Somali women's FGM Eradication Plan". The beneficiary organisation is the international civil society organisation Co-operation for the Development of Emerging Countries (COSPE). The Commission also recently finalised a project in Nigeria, carried out by a local organisations addressing violence against women, also including FGM. The aim of the project is to increase the report rate of gender based violence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1042"></a>

<p>(FR) Combating counterfeiting and piracy is a priority for the Commission. Every year it publishes a statistical report on the goods confiscated by the customs authorities of Member States. This report is drawn up from information submitted by Member States and according to the provisions of the legislation in force<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The reports are available on the Europa website at the following address:</p>
<p>http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/counterfeit_piracy/statistics/index_fr.htm" </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The results of joint operations carried out by the customs authorities of Member States are integrated with the results they have supplied to the Commission. At present the basis for collection of statistics does not make it possible for the Commission to provide more details, particularly in relation to the operations carried out. Nonetheless some operations carried out by the Commission services have given rise to specific reports. This type of operation always focuses on certain products, certain means of transport or specific countries of origin. Consequently the results are closely linked to the criteria applied.</p>
<p>Operation ‘FAKE’</p>
<p>In May 2005, the joint customs operation ‘FAKE’, organised by the Commission with the customs authorities of the European Union Member States, led to the seizure of 60 containers sent by sea and 140 consignments sent by air. This represents a total of more than 2 000 000 counterfeit products (including 1 258 110 packets of cigarettes) coming from China. The counterfeit goods seized were mainly textiles, shoes, bags, electronic goods, medicines, cigarettes, and other products (spectacles, belts, ink cartridges, watches, toys, razors, honey, toothbrushes).</p>
<p>Operation ‘DAN’</p>
<p>In 2006, operation ‘DAN’, initiated by 13 Community ports and coordinated by the European Commission, focused on goods coming by sea from China. This operation led to the seizure of 92 containers with a wide range of products. Among the counterfeit products seized were, for example, tens of thousands of toys, hundreds of boxes of sunglasses, millions of pairs of shoes and numerous fake spare parts for cars, DVDs, knives, clothes and millions of lighters and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Operation ‘DIABOLO’</p>
<p>In 2007, the joint customs operation ‘DIABOLO’, organised by the Commission with 27 European Union Member States and 13 Asian countries (</p>
<p><a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), as well as Interpol, Europol and the World Customs Organization, led to the seizure of approximately 135 million cigarettes with counterfeit trademarks and 1 089 585 other counterfeit products, namely textile products, shoes, toys, furniture, suitcases and watches. Furthermore, eight people have been questioned following this operation.</p>
<p>The report is available on the Europa website: http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/diabolo/i_en.html" </p>
<p>Operation ‘INFRASTRUCTURE’</p>
<p>At the end of 2007, the joint operation ‘INFRASTRUCTURE’, undertaken by the Commission with the support of the customs authorities of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium and the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to enforce intellectual property rights, led to the seizure of more than 360 000 counterfeit integrated circuits with more than 40 different trademarks and some fruitful exchanges of information. This was the first joint activity targeting intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Operation ‘MUDAN’</p>
<p>In 2008, the joint customs operation ‘MUDAN’, organised in April 2008 by the Commission with the support of the customs authorities of the European Union Member States, focused on postal packets from China and led to the seizure of 1 300 000 cigarettes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to coordinate and support joint customs operations of all kinds, including counterfeiting, a Permanent Operational Coordination Unit has been made available to Member States within the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in Brussels. This infrastructure, which has been used in particular for the operations ‘FAKE’ and ‘DIABOLO’, makes it possible to ensure real-time coordination of the flow of operational information during large-scale Community or international activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Defence-related products cover a broad spectrum of military goods and services, ranging from low sensitivity components and light arms to complex weapon systems, such as combat aircraft or war vessels, as well as highly sensitive material, such as nuclear, biological and chemical gear.</p>
<p>Member States can currently invoke restrictions to the circulation of defence-related products within the Internal Market on the basis of Article 30 of the EC Treaty. This Article permits certain prohibitions or restrictions on the free movement of goods between Member States on grounds of, inter alia, public policy or public security and the protection of health and life of humans, provided that such prohibitions or restrictions meet the proportionality test. This Article is not amended by the Lisbon Treaty. Two reasons play a particularly important role in this contrext:</p>
<p>1.	Member States wish to ensure that such material does not eventually end up in hostile hands or failed states. Reducing the threat of terrorism and the risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a key concern of all Member States.</p>
<p>2.	Member States also wish to ensure that defence equipment is not used by criminals within the EU. The prevention of violent crime and of terrorism within the EU requires a strict control of the circulation of many types of defence-related products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 296 of the EC Treaty may also allow Member States, under certain conditions, to take such measures as they consider necessary for the protection of the essential interests of their security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material. This Article is also not amended by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>As such, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty does not effect the possibility for Member States to introduce restrictions motivated by public security concerns.The proposal for a directive on simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community which the Parliament voted on 16 December 2008 nevertheless constitutes a major step towards a better integrated internal market for defence-related products without jepodizing national security concerns.</p>
<p>While the Commission did not foresee the possibility for the EU itself to issue licences for the transfer of defence-related products, the Directive adopted, has three important provisons which should gradually eliminate or substantially alleviate licensing requirements:</p>
<p>–	The Directive allows Member States to exempt transfers of defence-related products from the obligation of prior authorisation in several cases, for example when the supplier or the recipient is a governmental body or a part of armed forces;</p>
<p>–	The Directive contains an evolution clause whereby other transfers of defence-related products can be exempted from the obligation of prior authorisation, for example where the transfer takes place under such conditions as not to affect public policy or public security;</p>
<p>–	The system of general transfer licences put in place by the Directive is not an individual licence but a general authorisation to suppliers who fulfil the terms and conditions attached to the licence, to perform transfers of defence-related products to be specified in the licence to a category or categories of recipients located in another Member State.</p>
<p>This Directive will abolish many superfluous administrative formalities while allowing Member States to perform the necessary controls in order to prevent the wide dissemination of defence equipment and the risk of diversion.</p>
<p>The Commission will review the functioning of the Directive and submit a report to the Parliament and the Council in which it will evaluate whether, and to what extent, the objectives of the Directive have been achieved, with regard to the functioning of the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1063"></a>

<p>(EN) The fundamental principle of European Union (EU) food law is that all food and feed legally placed on the market in the EU must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from. A wide range of measures to ensure food safety and to assist in the removal of unsafe food/feed from the market have been introduced under Community legislation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the General Food Law Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, traceability on EU territory is compulsory for food business operators at all stages of the food chain, from the importer up to the retail level. That means that food operators must have in place systems and procedures to identify food business operators from whom they have received and to whom they have delivered products.</p>
<p>In particular for products of animal origin, including products from outside the Community, the food hygiene legislation enhances further the traceability rules of products of animal origin covered by Regulation 853/2004<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by requiring the application of a health mark or identification mark on such products.</p>
<p>The Commission does not agree that the system is inadequate. The recent contamination incident of Irish pork and beef with dioxins has demonstrated that the traceability of food of animal origin has significantly improved compared to similar contamination incidents in the past. Once the contamination was known, possibly contaminated Irish pork and beef was withdrawn from the market in 25 Member States and 12 third countries in a very short period of time thanks to the traceability systems in place. The rapid removal of possible contaminated meat from the market is the key to protect public health and to maintain consumer confidence.</p>
<p>As to the mandatory indication of labelling of origin for all foods in general, it must be underlined that origin labelling is not a tool for contributing to food safety. The Commission views origin labelling as primarily an instrument of consumer information, particularly about the characteristics and, as the case may be, about the quality of the food.</p>
<p>Origin labelling is required in cases where consumers might be misled on the true origin or provenance of the foodstuffs, and in application of specific rules such as those for fruit and vegetables, beef, wine, honey and fish. In addition, an indication of origin must be shown for imported poultry meat and, with effect from 1 July 2010, the origin of pre-packaged foodstuffs labelled as organically produced must be shown on an EU product (and on imported products if the Community logo is used).</p>
<p>The recent Commission proposal for a Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> does not extend the items to which compulsory origin labelling applies, but provides for rules in order to ensure that voluntary origin indications are based on the same criteria.</p>
<p>In particular, as regards meat different from beef and veal, the draft Regulation foresees that voluntary origin indications should provide information on the different locations of birth, rearing and slaughter of the animal in so far as that animal has not been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.</p>
<p>The Commission is certainly aware that the issue has given rise to further debate. In its Green Paper on agricultural product quality<a href="#defann_49_4" name="refann_49_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission specifically asked whether an obligatory indication of place of production of primary products, such as 'EU' or 'non-EU', could be useful to ensure a better connection is made between the farming input and the final product. The Green Paper was open for responses from stakeholders and the public. The consultation ended on 31.12.2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The judicial inquiry into the Siemens company has resulted in admissions of the existence of slush funds which were used to bribe political parties and persons in positions of responsibility.

<p>(EN) The Commission is glad to have supported the production of this report, which complements the data on infant (including perinatal, late foetal and neonatal) mortality annually collected by Eurostat. It provides a reference point which can guide action by Member States. And as the question identifies, the report shows significant variations across the European Union.</p>
<p>Regarding action to be taken, according to Article 152 of the Treaty, in the health domain the primary responsibility lies with the Member States. It is therefore primarily up to individual Member States to consider what issues this report identifies for them, and to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, addressing inequalities in health is one of the objectives of the EU Health Strategy. The Commission plans to publish a Communication on tackling health inequalities later in 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission has already taken action in this area. For example, the Commission has supported Member States in their actions aimed at reducing risk behaviours relating to perinatal and infant mortality in their populations. This includes informing women of risks associated with smoking and drinking during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports improvements in healthcare systems, such as through investment under the Structural Funds, and through research into better health technology and techniques under the Research framework programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue to produce this kind of comparable information on health and health-related behaviour of the population, on diseases, and on health care systems. As this PERISTAT report shows, such information enables benchmarking across Europe and helps to promote concrete action within Member States to help spread best practice throughout the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0006"></a>

<p>(EN) 1.	There is no legal obligation for the Commission or the Member States to keep statistics or to report on the application of Regulation 261/2004. Therefore, the Commission has no information on the number of complaints received by National Enforcement Bodies for the period mentioned by the Honourable Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>However, in its role of monitoring the correct implementation of the Community legislation, the Commission made reference to the number of complaints received in 2005-2006 in its Communication of 4 April 2007<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, (page 5 of SEC(2007)0426). Moreover, the European Consumer Centres (ECC) which are co-financed by the Member States and the Commission also issued two reports based on the complaints received by them in 2005 and 2006. These complaints concerned only cross-border cases (no national flights therefore) and also problems with luggage which are not covered by the Air Passenger Rights Regulation. These reports can be found in the Commission web page as well as in any of the ECC web pages.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has sent a questionnaire to all competent national authorities in November 2008 with deadline 15th of January asking for relevant information, including information on complaint handling on the operation of Regulation 261/2004 in 2007-2008. The answers to the questionnaires are currently under translation and analysis by the Commission services. The Commission intend to send soon a similar letter to the airline associations. The Commission services will compile and analyse all the available data and inform the Parliament about the outcome of this exercise in the second semester of 2009, as it was the case in 2007. The ECC has planned to issue their third report in 2009 on the complaints they have received in 2007-2008.</p>
<p>2.	Under article 16 of the Regulation, Member States are in charge of the enforcement and, therefore, it is for the Member States to proceed against the airlines that do not fully apply the Regulation. The Commission only can open infringement procedures against the Member States that do not respect their obligations on enforcement.</p>
<p>The Commission considered in its Communication of 2007 that a period of stability was required to allow NEB, airlines, Member States and the Commission itself to develop a practical, consistent and harmonised application of the Regulation. Further to the Communication, the Commission brought together In 2007, all the stakeholders (notaby airline associations and NEBs) to set up a set of documents that would improve the application of, and adherence to, the regulation. All these documents are available on the Commission's website<a href="#defann_52_3" name="refann_52_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. 2008 has provided us with the necessary period of stability that allowed all stakeholders to put into practice all the procedures and mechanisms that were agreed in 2007.</p>
<p>Since all the NEB were fully committed to this voluntary approach and started improving their enforcement, no infrigment procedures were opened in 2007-2008, during the stability period.</p>
<p>The meeting held in Brussels last 2 December, which gathered together again all the stakeholders, closed the period of stability and initiated the new evaluation phase, in which the Commission will analyse whether and why regulation 261/2004 may still be not adequately respected, and will take the necessary solutions.</p>
<p>In January 2009 the Commission is about to initiate contacts on three files with two Member States in the 'EU Pilot' system for problem-solving, two regarding lack of action of the Italian NEB and one regarding lack of action of the Spanish NEB. Subject to the answer of the competent national authorities in these cases, the Commission may open infringment procedures against them. Secondly, the Commission services will send a letter to several Member States in the coming weeks asking for further information regarding the way they enforce the Regulation vis-à-vis non-national air carriers. If the information to be provided by these Member States is not satisfactory, the Commission will open infringment procedures against them in 2009.</p>
<p>3.	Since only a reduced number of passengers which are dissatisfied with the airline or the NEB answers write to the Commission, the Commission considers that these complaints may not be representative of the overall situation in Europe. However, these complaints are very useful for the Commission to monitor how the Regulation is actually applied by member states and the air carriers, and to act accordingly whenever it seems necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission sends to the competent national enforcement authority all the letters of passengers providing information suggesting that the airline does not respect their obligations under the Regulation. The Commission follows up with the National enforcement bodies their work on these cases and keeps informed the passengers that request so.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages NEB to collaborate and to exchange information among themselves to ensure a more homogeneous implementation of the Regulation. To do so the Commission organises regularly meetings with the NEB. The last one took place on 2 December 2009, the next one is likely to take place in May through a joint meeting of the NEB-ECC-CPC networks. Points raised in passenger complaints are systematically discussed during these meetings.</p>
<p>4.	The number of complaints received by the Commission has fallen since 2005 and it has stabilised around 2200 letters and mails per year since 2007. The two kind of incidents mentioned by passengers more often are problems related to their luggage (regulation 889/2002 implementing the Montreal Convention), and long delay or cancellation of a flight (Regulation 261/2004). Further to the adoption of Regulation 261/2004, the number of overbooking and downgrading cases has clearly diminished.</p>
<p>5.	The Commission intends to provide another report to the Council and Parliament on the operation and the results of Regulation 261/2004 in Autumn 2009. The Communication to be adopted by the Commission on the second semester this year will analyse the 4 years of operation of the regulation in order to assess its success in reducing the number of incidents and improving the protection of air passenger rights. It will also announce the Commission's intentions regarding future legislative measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the ban order, issued on 11 November by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, the 'purpose and activity of al-Manar TV is to support, advocate and call for the use of violence as a means to achieving political and religious aims.'

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that some of the material broadcast by al-Manar TV amounts to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the EU-Egypt Association Committee on 16 December 2008 took stock of progress made on the implementation of the Association Agreement and the joint Action Plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy. Among other items on the agenda, the Association Committee discussed the conclusions of the different sub-committee meetings which were held during 2008; but no specific topic was raised in detail, as this is done in the relevant sub-committee.</p>
<p>The sub-committee on political matters with Egypt is the appropriate mechanism for raising issues related to the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance. This includes the undertaking in the joint EU-Egypt Action Plan to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the sub-committee on political matters with Egypt on 2-3 June 2008 did not raise the issue of incitement to hatred via the media. In light of the many other pressing developments that had to be addressed, as well as the EU’s priorities for this dialogue, it had been decided with the Member States that this issue would not be discussed in this first sub-committee meeting (see reply of the Commission to oral questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0480_EN.html">H-0480/08</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0491_EN.html">H-0491/08</a>).</p>
<p>The Commission has raised the issue of al-Manar's broadcasts on several other occasions: For instance, following an intervention of the Commission at the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> EU-Lebanese sub-committee meeting on Human Rights, Governance and Democracy on 17 November 2008 the Lebanese Government made a statement that they had never received an official complaint on al-Manar TV. In addition, the issue was discussed at the meeting of the Working Group of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulatory Authorities<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 4 July 2008. At the meeting of the Contact Committee<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 16 December 2008, the Commission asked the Member States whether recent evidence exists that al-Manar TV still incites to hatred and, if this was the case, whether they would consider to launch a diplomatic complaint with the Lebanese Government (and inform the Commission thereof).</p>
<p>The Commission continues to follow this issue closely and may raise it on another occasion under the EU’s regular political dialogues with Egypt and Lebanon or at any other forum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the problem of clear and complete pricing in the airline sector and has taken action in order to ensure that airlines improve their practices. In September 2007, the Commission coordinated with national authorities an EU sweep targeting websites selling air tickets, including airlines websites.</p>
<p>More than 400 websites were checked and the results showed that about a third had irregularities with misleading price information being one of the most common irregularities. Often airfares, sometimes advertised as free, would not include taxes and charges and therefore the final price charged would be substantially higher than the price advertised. 60% of these irregularities were rectified<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>within the subsequent 13 months. The other 40% remain under investigation.</p>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> obliges traders to provide consumers with the information they need, in a timely and clear manner, in order to make an informed choice. Traders must also provide clear, complete and final prices, inclusive taxes and other charges, where prices are advertised.</p>
<p>The Directive also states that even where information provided is technically correct, it will be deemed misleading where it deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer. In addition to this, the Directive's blacklist prohibits misleadingly describing a product as free where it is not.</p>
<p>More specifically however, the Regulation on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community<a href="#defann_54_4" name="refann_54_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which came into force on 1 November 2008, obliges airlines to display complete airfares. These should include taxes and airport charges and all other foreseeable fees.</p>
<p>In November, the Commissioner for Transport and I met with the representatives of the aviation industry to raise the level of compliance of their website with the EU consumer rights legislation. A checklist of compliance for their websites has been provided to the industry and the Commission has informed them that an independent study shall examine this spring which websites are in compliance with the checklist.<a href="#defann_54_5" name="refann_54_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) After a sharp and rapid increase at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008, the prices of many agricultural commodities fell drastically due mainly to the strong production development in 2008 at EU and world level. They are now back to levels similar at or even below those before the price spikes. Furthermore, the price decline has been exacerbated by the increased nervousness and uncertainty about the economic outlook and the general turbulence in the global financial system.</p>
<p>The price drop led to some income decline in 2008 in many EU Member States, although higher input prices (in particular energy and fertilisers) were in fact the main driving factor behind the fall in agricultural income. In Greece, the agricultural income per worker declined by 7% in real terms, despite a 3% rise in the value of agricultural products (resulting from a 4% increase in output volume and a slight fall of 1% in output prices).</p>
<p>In spite of these unfavourable price trends, the income of farmers in Greece in 2008 were substantially supported by the granting of the EU decoupled direct payments, which are paid regardless of the prevailing market price environment and which make up for around 40% in Greek agricultural factor income.

<p>European legislation already provides for possibilities and rules for using videoconferencing in cross-border cases:</p>
<p>Council act of 29 May 2000 establishing in accordance with Article 34 on European Union the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union</p>
<p>Council Regulation 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters</p>
<p>Council Directive 2004/80/EC of 29 April 2004 relating to compensation to crime victims</p>
<p>Regulation 861/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure</p>
<p>The 2001 Regulation enables a Court from one Member State to request a Court in another Member State to take evidence in another Member State. This Regulation provides for the use of the most advanced technological means and privileges videoconference. To support the implementation of this regulation, 50 000 copies of a practice guide on this Regulation were disseminated at the beginning of 2007 and served to raise awareness among the judiciary on these provisions.</p>
<p>In criminal matters, the 2000 Convention indicates that Member States shall agree to a request from another Member State about hearing a witness or an expert by videoconference, provided that it is not contrary to the fundamental principles of their national law and that they have the technical means to carry out the hearing.</p>
<p>The judicial authority of the requested Member State summons the person to appear in accordance with its national law. During the hearing, a member of the judiciary of the requested Member State has to be present. The person may claim the right not to testify in accordance with the law of the requested or requesting Member State.</p>
<p>These rules apply only to the hearing of witnesses and experts. However, Member States may also agree to apply the rules to the hearing of accused persons in accordance with national law and relevant international instruments.</p>
<p>The 2003 Agreement on mutual legal assistance between the European Union and the United States of America also includes provisions for the use of videoconference.</p>
<p>The Parliament's Resolution and the Council's Action Plan on e-Justice encourage consideration of all possible uses of videoconference tools in court cases.</p>
<p>2.	On 5<span class="sup">th</span> December 2007, the Commission adopted a report on the application of the Council Regulation 1206/2001<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. To prepare this report, a survey was carried out and published in March 2007<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It showed that, regarding the use of advanced communication technology in the taking of evidence,</p>
<p>62,2 % of the legal professionals indicated that it was rarely used,</p>
<p>17,7% had seen it being sometimes used and</p>
<p>4,2% often.</p>
<p>The use of advanced communication technologies was considered by 24,3% of these professionals as of interest to improve the efficiency of evidence-taking, to cut costs and to significantly reduce timescales.</p>
<p>Current discussions in the e-Justice Working Party of the Council have shown that, while videoconference is not yet widely used, recent efforts in all Member States have resulted in a much more widespread equipment of courts and increased interest in the use of videoconferencing facilities for cross-border cases.</p>
<p>A survey organised by the Council has shown that the equipment installed in different Member States respects the same international technical standards. However, organisational (such as contact points, testing phases, etc) and legal questions (sufficient understanding of another legal system and structure) may constitute stumbling blocks or hurdles to more widespread use of videoconference in cross-border cases.</p>
<p>3.	The Atlas of the European Judicial Network (EJN) in civil and commercial matters<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> includes a directory of Courts of all Members States. If the national Contact Point of the EJN has provided the information, it is possible to identify which courts are equipped with videoconferencing tools and to get in contact with them.</p>
<p>The future European e-Justice portal which is expected to be presented at the end of December 2009, will include more detailed information about the use of videoconference and location of videoconferencing equipment in Courts.</p>
<p>4.	European e-Justice is a priority for the Commission. In discussions regarding the use of IT tools to improve efficiency in cross-border cases the protection of the rights of victims and defendants is a key element. The organisation and legal background of the use of videoconference in national cases is the responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p>However, the Commission welcomes all comments and proposals aimed at improving the integrity of justice systems and protecting the rights of citizens. The Commission has direct contacts with European as well as national organisations of legal practitioners. In 2009, the use of videoconference in cross-border cases will be discussed at one of the meetings of the Justice Forum<a href="#defann_57_4" name="refann_57_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The purpose is to stimulate exchanges of experiences and discussions on the best use of this tool.</p>
<p>5.	It is necessary to assess properly the benefits and potential negative consequences of the use of videoconference in cross-border cases. It is essential to ensure full respect of citizens' rights and to ensure that the quality of legal professionals' work is not negatively affected, and to take due account of the needs of citizens and legal professionals when adapting to a tools.</p>
<p>For example, in cross-border cases, the procedure may take place in a multilingual context. Quality of interpretation is thus a crucial issue, which has to be considered in detail, both for on-site interpretation and remote interpretation.</p>
<p>The Commission supports research on the specific needs of interpreting in the framework of videoconference exchanges.</p>
<p>To achieve the full potential offered by videoconferencing and to ensure best use it is necessary to assess and promote best practice, to understand the difficulties and to provide practical answers. Additional legislation might be needed at a later stage, but it does not constitute the main barrier at the moment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In his question <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2008-6678_EN.html">P-6678/08</a>, José Javier Pomés Ruiz, MEP, incorrectly disputed the correctness of the term 'Euskal Herria'. Article 1 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country (Organic Law 3/1979) states: 'The Basque people, or Euskal Herria, as an expression of its nationality and in order to attain self-government, constitutes itself as an autonomous community within the Spanish state under the name of Euskadi or the Basque Country, in accordance with the Constitution and with the present Statute, which is its fundamental law'. In addition, Article 2 of the same Statute states that '[the provinces of] Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya, as well as Navarre, have the right to be part of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country'.</p>
<p>It should therefore be clear that the term 'Euskal Herria' is recognised by the Organic Law, in other words by a higher legal authority, and that the term also includes Navarre.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, can the Commission make it clear that there is no question of any 'technical error' having been perpetrated, despite the statement made in Commissioner Wallström's answer to the question?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Combating corruption is one of the key issues closely monitored and promoted by the Commission with regard to candidate countries and potential candidates in the Western Balkans. This is done in close cooperation with other major stakeholders, such as the Council of Europe, International Financial Institutions as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In our annual Progress Reports we refer in detail to the developments in this area. Fight against corruption is also a key benchmark for the visa liberalisation dialogue.</p>
<p>Overall, despite considerable efforts made in some countries, corruption remains a serious problem in most of the Western Balkans. In particular, conviction rates for corruption cases are usually low, leading to allegations of corruption within the judicial system. Financing of political parties, privatisation and public procurement are areas most vulnerable to corruption, but also other sectors such as education and health care are affected.</p>
<p>With regard to the candidate countries, there is some further progress:</p>
<p>In Croatia, the legal framework to combat corruption is now largely in place and the Office for the Fight against Corruption and Organised Crime (USKOK) continues to become more active. However, corruption remains widespread. Further efforts are required in tackling and prosecuting high level corruption as well as in the field of public procurement. A culture of political accountability is lacking.</p>
<p>The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made some progress in implementing anti-corruption policy and improved some of its anti-corruption laws. However, the fragmented legal system that has resulted from the large number of legislative acts continues to make implementation and monitoring difficult. Overall, corruption remains a particularly serious problem. Further steps are necessary, in implementing provisions on financing of political parties and election campaigns.</p>
<p>With regard to the potential candidates, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In Albania, progress in the fight against corruption remains slow. A new anti-corruption strategy for 2007-2013 with an action plan was adopted in October 2008. Implementation needs to start and monitoring mechanisms remain to be assessed. Corruption in Albania remains a particularly serious problem.</p>
<p>As regards Bosnia and Herzegovina, progress also remains slow. The Commission highlighted in meetings with BiH political leaders the need to demonstrate political will and take determined action to fight corruption. The country needs to improve its anti-corruption legislation and more vigorous investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>In Montenegro, efforts have been stepped up in monitoring, awareness raising and the adoption of the necessary legal framework for fighting corruption. However, corruption continues to remain a serious and widespread problem, with limited results in securing adequate prosecution and convictions.</p>
<p>Serbia has made some progress in fighting corruption and developing a comprehensive anti-corruption policy. The legislative framework improved, and specialised departments within the courts and prosecution offices were set up. However, practical results in fighting corruption so far have been limited and corruption continues to be widespread and to pose a serious problem in Serbia.</p>
<p>In the case of Kosovo, under United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1244/99, corruption is still widespread and a major problem. This is due to insufficient legislation and implementing measures as well as a lack of clear political determination and the weakness of the judicial system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
