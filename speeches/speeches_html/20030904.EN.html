This historic step demands of us, above all else, understanding, an understanding that must be profound rather than merely superficial, a real comprehension rather than just a random encounter. We need languages as a vector if this understanding is to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this place, we will soon be representing twenty-five states and over three thousand years of cultural history. Many cultures and many languages are far younger and hence less deep-rooted, so there is, in all of them, concern about their own identity. I believe that these concerns do not need to persist, and would like to give you the example of the South Tyrol, from which I come. We have benefited from the European Union. The Austrian minority in South Tyrol – speaking German and Ladin – has been greatly strengthened by the EU, by a policy of openness on the part of Italy and by developments in the European Union. It is my belief that this minority has become a bridge between Italy and Austria, between the German-speakers and Italian-speakers. That is why I would like to dispel the misgivings of the minorities, the small linguistic communities within the EU and of those who will be joining it.</p>
<p class="contents">This report seeks to value and maintain languages and cultures and to strengthen all of them – not just the official languages, but also the regional and less-used ones. Europe is a mosaic, and a very beautiful one, and we want this mosaic to be conserved rather than becoming a cocktail. In the Europe of Fifteen, there are at present over sixty minorities. Another sixty will be added from the ten candidate countries. This wealth of languages makes for diversity and enriches us, and it will be possible for many of these minorities to function as bridges between States. The Commission, with its action plan and its inclusive approach, has recognised that at the right time. I would like not only to single out Commissioner Reding for specific mention, but also to express due gratitude to her for this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plan on Linguistic Diversity is the right way forward. I am grateful to the Members of this House and to those who, in past parliamentary terms, have made substantial contributions towards this end, above all those in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport who have helped to improve this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament played a leading role in this. From 1981 to 2001, it has taken the initiative with the Arfé Report, the Kuijpers Report, the Reding Report, the Killilea Report, and, most recently, the Morgan resolution; now, with this resolution from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it wants to go one step further. This is a decisive moment before enlargement, when we are able not only to express our positions on the work that the Convention has completed, but also to offer proposals. The Year of Languages 2001 was important, but it was not enough. The learning of languages must not be limited to one year, but must become and remain a continuous process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seeks to create a multilingual and multicultural Europe where we advocate diversity, because as far as we are concerned that is Europe’s real wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ebner, both you and the Commissioner want the same thing. We now have to decide how to achieve it. I would like to go on to look at the two legislative proposals contained in the report. The first concerns an Agency on Linguistic Diversity. Although I do feel that such an agency would be useful, we must stop and think before launching such an undertaking. A feasibility study would be a vital stage in the considerations; it would provide us with a detailed assessment of the existing instruments, including those relating to regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">My services have carried out an evaluation of all of the activities relating to regional and minority languages, and a report should be published at the beginning of next year, which will serve as a first step on this path. I am sure you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that a feasibility study on the creation of a Cultural Cooperation Observatory – the Ruffolo report – is already under way. I feel that it would be useful to learn the lessons of that experience before embarking upon a new exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the importance we place on the Council of Europe’s activities in the field of languages. I agree with you: we must coordinate the efforts of the Commission and the Council of Europe. Before going any further in terms of creating an agency, there should be an exchange of ideas regarding the methods for greater coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to the adoption of a multi-annual programme. I must admit, Mr President, that this poses a problem, as the Commission cannot accept this recommendation. It is not a question of substance, as you know very well that we are of the same opinion in that respect. I have already had several opportunities to talk to you about this issue. I have supported the idea that in the current circumstances the best way of promoting regional and minority languages is through an integrated approach. I am totally convinced of this, as a separate programme would, in my view, mean further isolation of regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for just the opposite, that is, giving them greater recognition. We must ensure support for these languages by making use of the possibilities provided by the existing programmes. Moreover, the European Year – you will no doubt agree – was an experience that integrated regional and minority languages. The implementation report demonstrates that regional and minority languages now occupy a prime position.</p>
<p class="contents">After careful consideration, the Commission decided to present an action plan, which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which I have brought with me today. You should have received a copy. If not, I have some copies here that you can have. Would the President like one? President Roca, your copy awaits!</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan is based on the conclusions of the Helsinki Conference on regional and minority languages, organised under the aegis of President Ahtisaari in October 2002. Mr Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, if you like, I will outline this action plan, adopted on 24 July, in greater detail and talk to you about its implementation. The plan envisages the integrated approach I spoke about, as we must focus on the opportunities for financing within the framework of existing programmes and ensure that there is more awareness of these opportunities and that they are better utilised. As a result, thanks to the budget passed by Parliament, on 31 July the Commission published a call for proposals and the projects should be submitted by the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to say that we should take advantage of the discussions on the new generations of programme because if we truly want to implement a concerted action for languages, the new programmes should incorporate a significant multilingual element.</p>
<p class="contents">Before ending, I would very briefly like to mention some of the points in the report. As far as the definition is concerned, I believe we are in agreement: we should use that of the Council of Europe, as set out in the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages and the Mercator network, I know that many of you here are very interested in these instruments and hope that they can continue to operate. I can tell you that the proposal for a decision establishing an action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture is currently being negotiated. A total of EUR 5.4 million is being set aside to fund the Bureau and the Mercator network for the 2004-2008 period. You can therefore forget any concerns regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the annex to the motion for a resolution sets out 20 different requests. I must stress that most of these requests go far beyond what could be implemented within the framework of the two legislative initiatives proposed by Parliament itself. I do not want to go into detail, but would remind you that many concrete initiatives to promote regional and minority languages are contained in this action plan and that substantial funding is already available.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan aims to bring everything together and to present to the citizens in all their diversity the possibilities the European Union can offer them, the opportunities recommended in the action plan for languages, in other words the opportunities, Mr Ebner, that have exactly the same aim as your report: to turn this grand European linguistic mosaic into a great table for Europe’s cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, moreover, I must say that we feel very proud of this.

This is something which is also included in the draft Constitutional Treaty and we are particularly satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining linguistic diversity, as expressed through support for lesser-used languages, contributes, apart from anything else, to social cohesion, to preventing conflicts and, of course, should not in my opinion operate along lines of quantitative parameters, along lines of majorities and minorities. I take the same view of minority languages. They have an intrinsic value and should be dealt with as such.</p>
<p class="contents">There are in fact millions of Europeans who, alongside the official language of their country, speak a minority language, mainly within their communities, and this is a tradition from generation to generation which we all respect. That is why it is important for cultural ties to be used creatively for the purpose of communication and exchanges and not, of course, to isolate a community; this would be particularly negative and we have seen it happen in the past. It is therefore important for our strategies as regards minority languages to be characterised by an open spirit of cooperation, by scientific research and association with the wealth of cultural elements which surround them. Promoting cultural cooperation and exchanges is the best way of offering the public the area of European culture we all want to create.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present era of globalisation, concentration of resources and the prevalence of monolingual situations, maintaining minority languages must be addressed as a source of primary elements which have the freshness and verve to claim their expression over time, despite their limited extent. However, it should be stressed that it is only by opening these cultural communities up to dialogue that we shall find a fruitful solution. That is why I think that the Commission study is important and we await its results with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe there is a group of languages which forms a significant part of its heritage. We see this in this Chamber: 11 working languages and nine new languages which will be incorporated on the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe there are unitary states, nation states and also multinational states – states made up of several nations with their own languages. In my case, in the Spanish state, there are several nations. I belong to the Catalan nation, the language spoken by more than 7 million people – in other words, more speakers than two of the current official languages of the European Union, and more speakers than six of the languages of the 10 candidate states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner herself, Mrs Reding, was rapporteur for a report on the linguistic diversity in Europe in 1990. At that time the European Commission was asked to take account of the particular circumstances of the Catalan language within the European Union. In this regard, we can say that the steps recommended by Parliament – by means of the Reding report – at that time have not been taken: that official texts in Catalan should have validity and that the Commission should also regulate a form of incorporation of Catalan into the linguistic system of the European Union, since it is a language spoken more widely than many of the languages which are working languages and official languages here. We are not asking, under any circumstances, that Catalan should be a working language – the European Union's linguistic system is quite complex enough – we are simply asking for recognition of its validity as an official language and that it may participate in the wealth of this cultural mosaic. In this way we will be able to satisfy that plurality which Robert Schuman – as the President mentioned at the beginning of the sitting – spoke of during his lifetime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, through Mr Ebner's report we are at last putting that into practice and supporting language learning and multilingualism, including minority languages, like the language I am speaking now, Welsh, my mother tongue.']</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank the interpreters for translating the first part of my address – which was in Welsh – to be understood by the rest of the Members here.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to begin by congratulating and thanking Mr Ebner for adventuring in the task of writing a report on European minority languages and presenting so many constructive ideas to further respect for multilingualism in Europe. We all know how sensitive this issue of minority languages is in some countries which consider them a threat not only to the integrity of their state culture but also to their territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of minority languages is a matter very close to my heart, because I am, myself – as are many others in this Chamber – a speaker of a minority language. Minority-language speakers are no different to speakers of other languages. We only want to live a full life through the medium of our language, whilst not giving up, of course, the pleasure of learning and mastering many languages which open doors to cultures and windows to a better understanding of others.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that minority languages are back on the European agenda. For many years we have been in a stalemate over the legal funding for minority languages in Europe. The Commission and the Council have dragged their feet on this issue for far too long. Therefore, today's debate in Parliament is a major step forward which should ultimately lead to new legislation. Minority languages must be sustained and promoted if we are to live up to the claim of a Europe of diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">At this important juncture in Europe's future, with new members joining the Union, the European Parliament is again leading the cause for greater respect for minority-language speakers. I wish Mr Ebner well with his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The variety of regional and lesser-used languages across the continent of Europe is an integral part of our unique cultural heritage. We are culturally richer due to the fact that so many of these languages have survived in this multimedia globalised age and are still used on a daily basis. Credit is certainly due to the Commission, which has consistently supported the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the rapporteur's idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy. We recognise that the area of culture and language policy is primarily a national preserve. Nevertheless, I am convinced that by pooling a certain amount of our resources and experience, we can bring about improvements which would have Europe-wide benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Ireland, and in the neighbouring United Kingdom, the predominant language is an ever more global English. If against this backdrop lesser-used national languages such as Gaeilge, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh, which we heard so eloquently spoken here this morning by Mr Wyn, can thrive, there is no reason why any of our minority languages have to die out. We often talk about Europe's cultural heritage. The preservation of language diversity far outweighs preservation of architectural or artistic heritage, important as they may be, because language is a living thing. It is part of our very identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is vital to safeguard and promote these languages. A heritage of our past, they cement peoples and territories and add the specific characteristics and cachet to numerous regions throughout Europe, like here, Alsace or Catalonia – Northern Catalonia – from which I come. Mr Vallvé, we are the symbol of geographical diversity for the same so-called minority language.</p>
<p class="contents">I do wonder, however, about the means of fulfilling this objective and, in particular, the need for a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning. How, exactly, is it going to operate on the ground to promote this learning? Would it not be better to apply the subsidiarity principle and work at national level, much closer to local level? That would make it possible to respect cultural traditions and the administrative and constitutional organisation of each state by encouraging them to promote, first and foremost, the learning of regional and minority languages from nursery school and, then, the organisation of cultural events such as twinning and school exchanges that would encompass the identity and history of the people. We must not rob the Member States of their power of action in the field of training and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Amendment No 5 as a step in the right direction, as it encourages ongoing support for minority and regional languages in a context of political neutrality and independently of any mercenary, financial considerations. We must also provide a legal basis for these actions so that we can get out of the mess caused by the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and allow European funds to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, as a member of the Disability Intergroup, to say how pleased I am to see the reference to sign language, which, according to the Council of Europe, is used by more than 3 million of our fellow citizens. There could perhaps have been greater emphasis on these languages as their users face the same problems on a daily basis as the people using the languages covered by this report. It is essential that all the members of the Union ratify the Council of Europe’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. After 2001, the European Year of Languages, I hope that the excellent links we have with the Council of Europe can continue to grow, especially with the secretariat of the Charter. That would seem to me to be a pragmatic and effective way of encouraging and developing the use of our regional languages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret, however, that the report did not seek to define its subject and has left this to the Commission, which is invited, in paragraph 2, to lay down criteria on the basis of scientific elements. As legislators, it is precisely our role to determine these criteria. Thus we would undoubtedly have had to distinguish between regional languages and minority languages. Minority languages may be national or official languages in a Member State, one example being the German-speaking population in the Alto Adige region or South Tyrol, as mentioned by the rapporteur. Although these people speak German, it is more questionable whether German can be considered a regional language in Alsace as the Alsatian dialect, which is undoubtedly Germanic, is substantially different.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as regional languages are concerned, what exactly are they? Are they, for example, the langue d’oc in the south of France, or its distinct components, Provençal or Gascon? Above all, we must not forget that many of our national languages are themselves threatened. Indeed, the Parliament itself provides its own delegations travelling abroad only with interpreting services into English, as was recently the case with the delegation to Japan, and that leads me to believe that we are going down a dangerous path. My own language, French, is unfortunately losing ground every day as a language of international communication, but the very existence of others is threatened. I am thinking of Gaelic in Ireland and the languages of the Baltic states, which have only just escaped Russification.</p>
<p class="contents">We must certainly develop regional languages, and that is my conclusion, Mr President, but we must ensure that we do not undermine or weaken our national languages. We must ensure that there is no artificial reconstruction of abstract languages that are removed from the regional realities. We must ensure that we do not establish a restrictive and authoritarian system. The regional languages will contribute to our cultural wealth only if they meet these three conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the enlargement in 2004, some 6 million people will be added to this. In the Netherlands too, we have the phenomenon of a minority language, Friesian, which enjoys official recognition as such. As has been said before, linguistic diversity is a heritage of which we Europeans are proud, and so we should be. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union rightly recognises the cultural and linguistic diversity. In future, this will also form an inherent part of the European Constitution. The European Parliament has always made a case for protecting linguistic diversity and regional and minority languages. Various resolutions have been adopted in this respect. A budget line was created for this purpose as early as 1980. In 2001, the European year of languages was particularly intended to draw attention to the importance of languages, to language diversity, and to stimulating language teaching. This involved not only the major languages, but also lesser-used regional and minority languages. It was a sound initiative. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal left to be done in this area. I am therefore pleased that a plan of action is now being drafted in order to hammer this point home once more. I myself have spoken in favour of greater attention being given to sign language. We know that about 1 in 1 000 people – some 15 000 people in the Netherlands alone – are born deaf or become deaf before they reach the age of three. To them, sign language is an essential means of communication, so I am pleased that this component has been included in the present report. It would be good if sign language could be considered a minority language. Deaf people are often excluded from many areas of society on account of their disability. Their language deserves as much attention and support as do spoken minority languages. I sincerely hope that the Commission will manage to present a legislative proposal on language diversity by the end of this year. Peace in Europe is not only about effective economic cooperation. It is, above all, about demonstrating an interest in, respect for, and understanding of, people from a different culture. Language is an important key in this.</p>

It is not, however, meant only to be used, but should also emphasise and reinforce European consciousness. As we have already heard said many times today, one essential part of this richness is linguistic diversity, which we have taken on as our cultural heritage and must pass on as a matter of cultural responsibility. Put into practical terms, this means that we need institutions to take on this work, financial resources to make it possible, and voluntary organisations to give support in the performance of these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Being myself from Austria, a country in which six recognised ethnic groups and their minority languages are represented – three of them, including Roma, in my very small federal state of Burgenland alone – I know how difficult it is to meet all the demands involved in using languages properly and in maintaining them. Whilst it is the individual states that have responsibility for minority languages and for their support, the European Union cannot evade the obligation to take action to back them up in this; we are talking here about 40 million EU citizens and 60 regional and minority languages. The European Year of Languages was, as we have heard, a great success; it also sent the right signals and pointed us in the right direction. Now is the time for what we have learned to be put into practice, and I would agree with Mrs Martens that sign language must absolutely be included, as the deaf must be able to participate in social and political life.</p>

Today is therefore a particularly well chosen time to present the report on regional languages and cultural diversity. I want to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Ebner for all the hard work he has done. As many in this House have pointed out, we now need practical efforts in order to make further progress with this work. I believe that, as Mr Ebner said, developments will increase the need for measures on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to share our various experiences of linguistic diversity and language learning. I therefore believe it important for a relevant institute to be set up. I nonetheless believe that there is no great difference between how matters look at present and what is discussed in the report, where there is explicit talk about what are called language baths. This is an extremely good method, which has been used to good effect in South Tyrol, Catalonia and Finland. I see no mention of it in the Commission’s action plan, but I am glad the plan states that the universities must review their language policies so that English is not so dominant.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to emphasise that we must investigate, and go more deeply into, the issue of an institute for linguistic diversity and language learning. I am convinced that such an institute is needed. I also wish to thank the Commissioner for mentioning the conference in Finland. We learned a lot at this conference, lessons I hope may also be taken on board by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the European Year of Languages, the Council even went so far as to state that all languages are equal in dignity. That is all very well, but as the joke goes, some are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">Those that are more equal than others are the official languages of the Union. The others, although equal in dignity, are not equal in law. My national language, Catalan, is spoken by more than 10 million citizens of the European Union. These 10 million people cannot use their own language in their relations with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore discriminated against in relation to our fellow European citizens. Why? It is because we Catalans have not had our own State since Barcelona was taken by the Franco-Spanish armies on 11 September 1714. We therefore know what has to be done. The democratic exercise of the right to self-determination will one day soon resolve our European linguistic problem. I give you my word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Linguistic diversity is being destroyed in Europe. In short, I believe that the solution to this problem does not simply lie in supporting languages or minority languages, because this is not enough, it will not suffice; I believe that the solution lies in a difficult and uncomfortable word: Esperanto. Let us try it at least! According to studies, this language, as a technical and neutral language, could be learnt and, therefore, chosen as a political language in place of other languages. To use other languages, which represent and bring with them a culture, as sole languages or as bridge languages, would be to encourage the predominance of one culture over another, which is what is already happening now. With Esperanto this issue, this shortcoming, does not arise. If it is true, and I believe it to be so, that this language is as easy to learn as is claimed by many international studies, then I believe that the European Union should at least try exploring this avenue. Funding and support are not enough when facing the destruction of linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Knowing our neighbours’ language and culture better means understanding them better and respecting them, and so I see language as performing an essential task in the sense that knowledge of other people’s languages promotes peace. If we look more closely into the trouble spots in and around Europe, we discover that a lack of respect for those who are different – which involves languages – has very often brought about the trouble in the first place and led to the situation in these places worsening. I therefore see language as being about more than knowing and respecting others. I see language as the best peacekeeping force that we in Europe can deploy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes clear, though, that, in an ever-expanding Europe, there is increasing awareness of regional cultures and also of regional languages. Belonging as I do to the German-speaking community in Belgium, I can see that respecting this is not a luxury for those regions that enjoy autonomy, but something I regard as a European fundamental right. It is for that reason that governments have – as we have just heard said – the primary task of guaranteeing the cultures of smaller regions and their right to have their voices heard. We should then, at the European level, give consideration to what additional instruments we employ. We appreciate Mr Ebner’s work in representing us in this House.

That is why it is a very positive move that in the new draft Constitution the Union’s linguistic diversity is being recognised. Under Article 3 the Union will respect the wealth and diversity of its cultures and languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I do hope that at last we are moving on from speech to action in the area of language policy also. Throughout the current parliamentary term we have encountered almost insurmountable problems whenever we have tried to steer funds from the Union’s budget in the direction of minority languages. The reason has been the absence of any legal basis. Fortunately, we have been able to avail ourselves of multiannual programmes such as Socrates and Culture 2000, not forgetting the European Year of Languages 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Ebner, has done an excellent job. I agree with him that the EU should have an Agency on Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning. There should also be sufficient resources allocated to it for it to function effectively in an enlarged Union. With enlargement the number of regional or minority language communities is estimated to double from the present number of approximately 60. We must also give our support to the proposal for a multiannual programme on linguistic diversity and language learning.</p>
<p class="contents">No agency or action programme, however, will solve the problems that EU citizens who speak regional or minority languages encounter in many Member States. The right to an education in one’s own native language in particular should be guaranteed in all Member States. For this there has to be investment in the training of teachers of regional and minority languages.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be limited scope in future budget headings in respect of internal policies for financing activities to encourage the use of regional and minority languages. I hope that more resources under the Structural Funds can be directed towards such activities. We should also inform speakers of regional or minority languages of such possible resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we often forget human biodiversity, one of the main manifestations of which are the different languages and cultures which are sometimes not respected or protected, but rather there is simply an attempt to eliminate them, for the sake of the commercial convenience of uniformity and globalising tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I believe that the individual, the person, is above commercial and economic interests, I would advocate constant support for national, regional and minority languages, independently of changes in political power, as well as decisive support for multilingualism so that we can build our Union without it becoming a confused tower of Babel.</p>

I would say, and this is, indeed, most significant, that the rights of freedom of the rapporteur have, in a sense, been violated in this House: when Mr Ebner mentioned his region, he called it – as is his right – <span class="italic">Südtirol</span>, and in the Italian translation it was adapted to the bureaucratic name fixed by the Italian centralist State and translated incorrectly, as ‘Alto Adige’.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as he rightly said, quoting the great Europeanist, Dr Silvius Magnago, is a wonderful mosaic of nations and should, therefore, see its unique ethno-linguistic character as a precious gift to be defended and valued.</p>

Both Piedmontese and the other two minority languages have suffered and continue to suffer now, in 2003, from serious oppression by the centralist Italian state, and this is certainly one of the reasons for fighting to obtain federalism in Italy without delay, and demand full freedom and independence for our lovely region of Piedmont and for a free Padania.] </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In contrast to Welsh and Basque, you would probably not have had to submit your speech beforehand. We would have had it translated for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend warm thanks to Mr Ebner for his initiative in producing this report. Along with Mr Grosch, who has also already spoken, he represents linguistic minorities in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I think the South Tyrol and Eastern Belgium are, along with other places, successful examples of how minorities make for enrichment rather than for instability and also build bridges. In Eastern Belgium and the South Tyrol, multilingualism can be heard, and, above all, seen. This visible multilingualism is something we have not yet achieved in this Parliament building, where what we can read is all in one single language.</p>
<p class="contents">We find nonetheless, in our fifteen Member States and ten candidate countries, which are stable democracies, a repressive reflex towards minorities and their languages, mainly for reasons of history. I want to make it perfectly plain that there are no separatist or extremist languages, but, if anything, only separatist or extremist people, with whom we have to deal by means of policy or the criminal law. That is why linguistic minorities as such cannot be generally suspected of imperilling the unity of the nation by using their language. For this reason, I find it quite incomprehensible that not all Member States have ratified the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Council of Europe’s framework convention on the subject. I would call on those states that have not yet done this to do so. It will not endanger their national unity or territorial integrity. Those who have problems with this leave themselves open to the suspicion that they are very insecure and believe it self-evident that their own language and culture can only be safeguarded by restricting others rather than through their own attractiveness. I would urge a bit more boldness on those who still hesitate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This inevitably leads to the conclusion, therefore, that in the debate on this report and on future Commission policies in the area of linguistic diversity, we are dealing with an issue which is not just highly topical, but which is at the very heart of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">So congratulations on this good report. Allow me to comment, however, on a single area of concern: as a Catalan speaker, I am aware of the existence in Europe of languages spoken by millions of people which are not thought of as being minority languages or regional languages and which – despite having official status within their autonomous region – are not state languages and are therefore not languages with official status in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To deal with the problem of the institutionalisation, the status and the function of these European languages is perhaps the fundamental key to deciding whether the policy of a future European agency for linguistic diversity or the policy on the European institutions is really going to be faithful to the slogan of the future constitutional Union: united in diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we have heard many minorities speaking up for themselves. It is unfortunate that we do not have today interpretation into sign language, as we did with the Lynn Report. I am grateful to the rapporteur and also to the Committee for finding room for sign language in this report and in this programme, which opens the door to its being recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have expressed the view in this debate that sign language should be promoted as a health resource. I think this would profoundly violate the rights of the deaf minority. Sign language is not a crutch or a wheelchair. Not only is it a language used by 15 000 people, but we should also bear in mind that it is the only language in which these 15 000 people can carry on a conversation. For recognising them as a linguistic minority and acknowledging that their language also contributes to the diversity and richness of European languages, I am grateful to all who have had a hand in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry, Roy (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I will start by saying that the Television without Frontiers Directive is one of the successes of the European Union and has undoubtedly helped European television. However, we also have to recognise that the television industry in Europe at the present time is not without difficulties. I am thinking of issues like restricted advertising revenues, and a significant number of companies are currently facing financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry today is greatly different from 1997, when the Directive was last revised, and barely recognisable from the TV industry of 1989, when the Directive was adopted. In 1989 there were just 47 television channels in the whole of Europe. Today that figure is 2000. TV is an important industry, with turnover estimated at EUR 62 billion per annum. The role of the EU must be to help encourage the industry and in no sense to restrict it.</p>
<p class="contents">TV is now facing important technological changes: there is more satellite TV, digital TV, convergence with the Internet and new advertising techniques, such as split-screen advertising. The directive, however, is beginning to creak, and revision cannot be put off indefinitely. Indeed, a thorough review is becoming urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the Commission's careful approach and congratulate the Commissioner on her careful and extensive consultation. However, we need to take care: too long a delay in revising the directive will impede progress in the industry. We should not move away from the fundamental principles of the present directive which relies largely on self-regulation and is not too prescriptive. We should no more seek to control what people watch than we would seek to control what books they might wish to buy in a bookshop. Therefore, I am clear that overzealous use of quotas and too detailed definitions would be wrong. Above all, we should only seek to regulate and influence at a European level that which is of transeuropean concern.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are European issues we need to address. For instance, events of major importance need to remain free to air, and there is a case for a short European list of such events. There was a real risk that last year's World Cup would not be freely available in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am as keen as any colleague to encourage European content in television, although primarily that could be helped by the 'MEDIA Plus' Programme. I also urge the Commission to look at ways to ensure that channels like Euronews and Arte flourish and develop. They help create a European television identity and help our citizens to appreciate and understand the European dimension in their lives. Euronews in particular is a very effective means of allowing European and world citizens to get a European perspective on current affairs, rather than an exclusively national or American view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge the Commission to find means to protect the diversity of ownership of television and to guard against undue concentration of ownership. Plurality of media ownership is important for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report I touch on two particular issues which may be seen as minor but are important. First, the needs of viewers with sensory impairments: these fellow citizens wish, and have the right, to enjoy television. I hope the Commission will conduct the study called for as soon as possible to enable us to get best practice for subtitling, sign language and audio description in television broadcasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to raise the issue of those European citizens – often retirees but not only – who move to a place in the sun. Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy and France are indeed wonderful and hospitable countries, but for those people from the north of Europe it is nice to watch television programmes from their own country and even to watch their own country play in a football match. Many people do this by skirting around the law by watching via satellite broadcasters from their own country. They often ignore the terms of their contracts or even use pirate technology. Perhaps that is not a big problem, but, as sensible legislators, we ought to be able to frame sensible laws that allow citizens to lead their lives within the law and not in a grey market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I thank the Commissioner for her commitment to Europe's television. I urge her to heed this report and to come forward as soon as possible with practical proposals to revise the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Commission congratulates Mr Perry on his work, evident not only in this report but also in the efforts made over the past months to contribute to a reform of the directive that is in the interests of our citizens. On 6 January, the Commission adopted the fourth report on the application of the Directive and a work programme for its revision incorporating a public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we note in this report on the application of the Directive? Firstly, we noted that the Directive is operating relatively well. Nevertheless, recent technological developments call for more detailed reflection. The aim of the public consultation was to enable the Commission to assess the need to update or adjust the Directive and the report and today’s debate will help us in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of its work programme, the Commission organised two series of public hearings, in April and June, and interested parties were invited to participate in public debates by responding to specific questions and forwarding their responses to us. We received 160 written contributions, which are all available on the Commission’s website with the exception of a few whose authors asked for them to be kept confidential. Based on the analysis of the results of this consultation, the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2003 or beginning of 2004 a communication on the future of audiovisual policy, which will be accompanied by proposals if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the challenges of the revision is to take account of technological innovations. I am thinking in this respect of the Council’s 1998 Recommendation on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and Audiovisual and Information Services, which is the first legal instrument to cover the content of audiovisual services on the Internet. After the break, the Commission intends to publish a second report on the implementation of the Recommendation based on a questionnaire that was sent to the Member States. The aim of this report is to ascertain the progress made, to make it possible to make a direct comparison and to include the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry raises several questions in his report, to which I would like to respond, without prejudice, of course, to the consultations under way. The first relates to the scope of the Directive, referred to in paragraphs 7 to 12. Mr Perry calls for the definition of audiovisual content to be extended to take account of media convergence. However, as long as television broadcasting services continue to enjoy unequal importance and impact in our societies, it would be difficult to reach consensus on the concept of content without frontiers. This was also borne out by the consultation. In addition, while information society services are at an early stage in their development I feel that it would be inappropriate at the current stage of negotiations to subject them to the more detailed approach of the Directive. The very first thing that must be done therefore is to ascertain whether the Directive provides the appropriate regulatory framework for the coming years or whether it needs to be adjusted, and this will be verified in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the working group of national regulators, mentioned in paragraph 19, the Commission held a meeting with the regulators in March and the next meeting is due to be held on 14 October. Some Member States do not, however, see the need for an additional committee and have already expressed concern that this committee may duplicate work already being done. I am not in favour of the systematic participation of public and private broadcasters; I prefer a system of ad hoc invitations like the one we are using at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to self-regulation and co-regulation – paragraph 20 of the report – I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on co-regulation. As a result, in the working documents we have specifically raised this question and I think that we will be able to make some progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to paragraph 28 concerning channels that have a pan-European dimension. I do not think that it is up to the Commission to take the initiative in this field. Indeed, given the disappointing results of a study on the possibilities of using digital platforms for thematic channels, it would be difficult for the Commission to finance any new studies on this subject. Having said that, we are going to contribute indirectly to the creation of pan-European channels by establishing a favourable regulatory framework and by supporting the creation and broadcast of European audiovisual works.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the question of television for disabled people – paragraph 34 – we must not forget that the Directive deals essentially with the aspects linked to content and the issue of disabled persons is therefore not formally covered in the report on the application of the Directive as it does not fall within its scope. It is up to the Member States to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area. Nevertheless, access to television services for disabled people is very important. My services have received many contributions regarding these pertinent issues and all of these can be found on the Commission’s website. The website also contains the contributions from associations representing disabled people. In order to make some progress in this area, we plan to organise a round table on 21 October in association with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the United Kingdom and to invite the Member States to attend and to report on the situation at national level. We are therefore going to continue in this way, and I must also point out that the Information Society DG has set up a working group that has been christened ‘Inclusive Communications’. This aspect is thus being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards media concentration, discussed in paragraphs 36 to 42, I support the idea in the Perry report that pluralism is an important element in safeguarding democracy. This idea is fully reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I would also like to stress that one of the topics covered by the May 2003 Green Paper on Services of General Interest relates precisely to the protection of pluralism. All interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 15 September. The Commission will determine its future policy on the basis of the conclusions of this consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will not be able to comment on all of the changes to the Directive today because we have not yet received all of the written contributions. We receive new contributions every day and I would like to allow my colleagues to complete their analysis before informing you of them by way of the communication on audiovisual policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cooperated with the rapporteur, Mr Perry, and I am in the happy position of saying that we have taken a common approach. The Commission needs to pay particular attention to Mr Perry’s individual proposals if we are to take another step forward on the interconnected problems linked to the whole of the audiovisual sector. This year’s report has a factor of additional interest compared with previous reports, because it proposes in its annex a programme of work which makes provision for dialogue to develop with the individual national agencies, such as radio and television organisations, independent regulatory authorities etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to reform the directive so that it can monitor rapid technological progress, but it also has other individual objectives. All these objectives mean that a difficult job awaits the Commission and it must convince us of how it is going to work in order for all the necessary adjustments to come about.</p>
<p class="contents">Another conclusion on which we more or less agree is the dual role of the audiovisual media. They are an economic commodity, which is why they are linked to the issue of competition, to the knowledge society being promoted by the Lisbon policy. Full coordination is therefore needed here. At the same time, they are a cultural commodity and their promotion needs to take account, on the one hand, of the public interest, such as protecting minors and safeguarding cultural diversity; on the other hand, however, they must take horizontal account of the European interest, which is to safeguard the European identity against non-European standards, especially American standards. We need to realise here that the danger from the commercial deficit on the audiovisual media market in comparison with the corresponding American products is directly linked to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue has started. It may be public. I would say, however, that it needs greater publicity and greater visibility. In view of all this, the reform of the Television without Frontiers directive must be one of the most serious concerns of all three institutions of the European Union because, over and above clarifying disputed concepts, such as independent producers etc., we need to guarantee the availability of digital options to a wide public and promote the cohesion of the policy of the audiovisual industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that he usually deals with difficult issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries. That is why we support the Commission, which had the quite right and sensible idea of seeking the opinion of each Member State before taking any decisions on the revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific improvements to the Directive are no doubt necessary to take account of technological developments, but we must ensure that these adjustments are not premature. In fact, if we look objectively at the situation of the audiovisual market, we can see that the national markets are adapting bit by bit to the new technologies. Thus, the recent technological developments have not really disrupted the audiovisual landscape, which continues to be dominated to a large extent by traditional television. Future changes to the Directive must under no circumstances disrupt its content. A revision calling into question the cultural objectives on which the Member States had reached agreement, under the pretext of extending the scope of the Directive to include all broadcasting formats, would in reality change completely the initial aims of the Directive, that is, the defence and promotion of cultural diversity. The main provisions of this Directive must not be called into question. The key principles must continue to form the foundation of the Community’s audiovisual policy: the promotion, movement and broadcast of European works within Europe; the production and broadcast of works by independent producers; the existence of broadcast quotas for television services; the guarantee of protection of minors; and measures to combat excessive advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">The Television without Frontiers Directive has proved its worth as a legal instrument and is now being applied satisfactorily. Its revision can only be justified if it makes genuine improvements to certain elements such as the worrying issue of media concentration, which obviously undermines pluralism. The Directive must continue to be a useful tool in promoting cultural diversity and must not become a legal instrument providing solely for the promotion of commercial channels where we would see, for example, continuous advertising with disregard for the works broadcast. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly vital, is the simple question of our cultures, our identities and the values in which we believe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the directive will have to be revised if its objectives for the future are to be achieved. My Group takes the view that the Commission is too hesitant in this respect. What is in fact at stake is the safeguarding of cultural diversity, a wide range of opinions and pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst democratic opinion today is, in essence, shaped by television, this is no longer only the traditional television with analogue transmission. More and more, we have digitalisation to cope with. I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin, where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing, and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be clear, however, that we need to establish a system of graduated regulation, and this is where there will be new demands placed on future legislation. Not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms, so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not. If I might put it rather loosely, it is on that basis that legislation can be drafted with varying degrees of rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will also be demanded of the rules that will have to be laid down, not only, to be sure, under the television directive, but also in parallel with it, in order to counteract the accumulation of economic power, which becomes media power and, eventually, also political power. We are dealing here with a development that makes it plain that bounds must be set at European level to contain media concentration, which does indeed endanger pluralism. As we can see from the example of Italy, national legal resources are not, in any case, sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important directive, and thanks to the Commission's regular reports, we are gaining a clear insight into its functioning, which enables us to prepare well-considered proposals for a possible revision in future. I do have some remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, given the current increase in media convergence, both in the present Member States and in the acceding countries, we must continue to hammer away at pluriformity, both in the public broadcasting corporations and in the private stations. This is crucial to my group, and I assume my fellow Liberal will also stress this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, sound criteria are needed to protect minors from aggressive TV commercials. In fact, with regard to television programmes too, it is important for children to be able to make informed choices and for their parents to be able to help them in this. My group is a great believer in self-regulation, which gives me an opportunity to stand up for the Dutch system, ‘<span class="italic">Kijkwijze</span>’, which enables parents and children to make informed choices by means of pictograms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say how pleased I am by the wide support given to my proposal for a pan-European children's network. It is a good way of distributing European productions for children on a larger scale, since it combines broadcasting licence-holders from the Member States and candidate countries. Excellent children's films have been made in Europe. If we now see that in my country, the national production of quality films has enjoyed an enormous boost, which is what I read the morning of the day we returned from the film festival in Venice, that the proportion of Dutch films among those seen by cinema audiences has increased by some 6%, and especially audiences composed of young people, due to an innovative approach whose key aim is to show producers that they are making films for a certain audience – an audience-specific approach, in other words – then I can only be optimistic about the preservation of our cultural diversity in the media, and there is certainly a place for television without frontiers, and, needless to say, for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue is a difficult one and is undergoing constant change. I must thank Mr Perry for his work, and yet I am unsure whether or not this Directive needs to be revised. This has been stated clearly both by those working in the industry and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This current issue comes up against the problem of definition and apprehension raised by the transfer of images, the development and acceleration of which we have not yet managed to control.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me is the absence of a definition of a ‘work’. The Television without Frontiers Directive provides a negative definition. We know what it is not. It is not information, it is not advertising, it is not this, it is not that. It is produced by X or made by Y. I, myself, would prefer – and I believe that some of those working in the industry would also prefer – to know what it is. That would perhaps make it easier to settle the ongoing debate in France and other European countries on reality television. The problem is defining the scope of audiovisual works. Some works are very easy to define, such as documentaries and films, but not all are. I do not know how to define reality television and this is a serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point raised by this debate is the movement of works. The movement of works and artists is a recurring problem in the field of culture, as I highlighted in the report on the performing arts. In the context of Television without Frontiers, it is magnified as a result of concentration and the non-national nature of the sector. How can we promote non-national works in each of our countries? We will have to give our opinion on this fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry, you paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of media concentration, which can prevent the movement of non-national works. I am very pleased that you stress this point as, in my view, it is vitally important and something we must look at very seriously indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we talk about European works, for example, we include completely ridiculous talk shows, under the pretext that they are European productions. Until we have the courage to define what a work is – and that is where Mrs Fraisse is right – in other words, what it is that we want to protect, our television services will be unable to protect European production and European works in Europe for want of the appropriate instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards concentration, the problem is very simple. If we do not define what we cannot democratically accept in Europe, there will be more and more concentration and non-European forces will dominate the market. For both these reasons, I believe that the European Union must have the courage to define what a work is and to define what should be the limit, democratically, between political power and the power of the media. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I and Mr Volcic have tabled some amendments to the excellent, and I repeat, excellent, report by Mr Perry, regarding an issue which you have all touched upon, media concentration and, therefore, pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Reding had to say in defence of pluralism as an essential value. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact that, throughout the western world today, market forces, if left to themselves, almost always lead to serious, dangerous phenomena of concentration and that only a political measure can lay down the rules for a liberal society, the essential basis of which is pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, facing a major political battle on this issue, taking place in the US, where there is a deadlock between Congress and the authority, and in Europe with the grave problems in England that have thrust themselves upon our attention and the problems in Italy that many of you are aware of. I do not want you to think, however, that the amendments tabled by Mr Volcic, and myself urging Parliament and the Commission to adopt a measure, a directive, in line with what was, moreover, approved by Parliament in November, were dictated solely by Italian issues. There is truly a much greater, much wider issue here that affects the whole of Europe: it is an issue of civilisation. If we want to be a Community based on liberal principals, then this is one of the first issues we need to regulate, in a spirit of freedom and respect for all opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that content is no longer dependent only on the medium of television, but, in the same way, on many other technological media, and if we want to maintain diversity, we have to find ways whereby we can achieve common rules in this area, which do justice to the various demands, albeit in a slightly different procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues I would like to address, and the first is media pluralism. This Parliament has very emphatically spoken out, most recently on 10 November 2002, in favour of greater support for, and underpinning of, media diversity in Europe and against unhindered media concentration. I would press upon the Commission the urgent need to do what this vote by Parliament demands of it and put before us the pieces of work that we have asked for. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot, however, endorse Amendment No 10, which was tabled today, as it refers exclusively to one instrument, the directive, and because we will achieve a result in this area only if we balance, in an appropriate and proper way, the competences of the Member States and those of the European Union. Considerations of media pluralism therefore demand the solution that we called for in our resolution in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to address is the protection of young people. New technologies require that children and young people be protected in the same way as is provided for in the television directive. Let us therefore work together towards a new system and new ways of self-regulation with minimum standards accepted by all. I wish the Commission much success as it travels down this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression, diversity of opinion and pluralism, creativity and the right to free access to information. Public broadcasters must perform their educational function, by which I mean that the quota for the transmission of European programmes and works by independent producers could be increased. This is an aspiration with which I wish to associate myself. There must, however, be clear, workable and manageable definitions of what is meant by European works and independent producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the requirement that levels of media concentration be monitored as being the most important. We have examples of media power and political power being concentrated in one pair of hands. I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy, and so this is a vitally important area of concern. We will no doubt have to work towards a directive founded on our demands in the 20 November resolution, and, if all these things come together, I hope that we will be able to do all that media diversity in the European Union requires of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive confirms once and for all that European democracy and transparency is closely connected to the freedom and pluralism of the media. Therefore, media concentration jeopardises freedom of conscience and is a grave injury to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Green Paper of 21 May 2003, the Commission calls for specific measures to be looked at once again to actively protect pluralism; in its Recommendation of 28 January 2003, the Council expressed the same concern; in its Resolution of 20 November and the two reports by Mr Sylla and Mr Perry, Parliament said likewise. We must, therefore, give a specific response through a Commission initiative to this effect.</p>

Above all, moreover, it wishes to promote the development of the European audiovisual industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European audiovisual industry must above all be an industry of quality. As a mother of two small children, I naturally look for children's programmes and cartoons – with a view to finding programmes which do not injure their sensibilities and which are not prejudicial to minors – and I often find that these programmes or cartoons intended for small children are much more violent than anything even I would like to see. I often remember how, as a child, I heard adults talking about how they believed that cartoons such as Bambi or Pinocchio were not suitable for us, but now that kind of thing is by far the most ethical programme we can find.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want a society free of violence, which is what we all aspire to, we must invest in it. Investing in it means investing in children and young people, who are the future of the European Union. I believe that showing them violence on a daily basis is not the best way to do so. I would therefore insist that the European audiovisual industry must be of high quality, strictly controlled and, above all, must be suited to its intended audience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zorba (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty reformulates in one of its articles the cultural dimension of Europe and this constitutional foundation expresses a clear political position. Namely that European culture is a fundamental component of the European economic and social model which is needed if the political venture of the European Union is to be completed. It is the duty of us, as Members of the European Parliament, to convert this constitutional formulation to an active, effective policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that, with the report on cultural industries, we are making such a step. We have expanded our policy horizontally with certain important admissions which have to do with the conditions of production and consumption of cultural products and services by European citizens. We demonstrated during the preparation of this report and in the dialogue held in the Committee on Culture with all the honourable Members, and I must thank them for that, the central importance of creation and of creators as a basic source of the added value of cultural products. We took account of the important economic dimension of culture nowadays, its role in the economic development of regions and towns and its contribution to GDP and to the employment sector. We noted the revolutionary changes brought about by new technologies in many of the sectors of the cultural industries, such as in music, in publications and in the audiovisual sector. We discussed in detail the importance of the competitiveness of European products, compared with those from other countries of the world, the inequalities of the international trade and the close link between cultural heritage and tourism. European citizens consume millions of copies of disks and books and buy millions of tickets to the cinema and concerts every year. All this constitutes their cultural diet, thereby shaping their profile and their cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens also watch television programmes. They receive information and influence on the Internet from a massive quantity of material which we refer to as content. In these ways they select, cultivate and promote one form or another of art and culture, different aesthetics and quality, in close dependency on education and their personal development. It is a complex cultural process which characterises the daily life of citizens and we should not ignore the broad political importance and weight which it has.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, enlargement gives Europe an even greater cultural dimension, together with diversity. The internal market is growing. Creators’ works must overcome a number of obstacles, such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy, in order to find a way of reaching the European public. What we are looking for is European added value and that also applies to the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises working in the various sectors. In order to address all this, we have made a series of proposals to the Commission. They are numerous, but I shall comment on just three.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the need for a definition of cultural industries and the sectors they include. We need here to analyse the cultural, commercial and economic dimension in order to include the sectors in the definition of cultural or creative industries, as they are called in certain countries. I think this will give us a better statistical picture, which we do not have at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second call on the Commission is to map the cultural industries at European level. We are calling for it to concentrate on cultural, economic, legal, technological and educational aspects, to include employment, intellectual property, the competitiveness network, new products and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we consider that it is very important to have a Green Paper in order to promote the coordination of the Member States and the regions in the sector of the cultural industries, so that obstacles can be analysed, solutions suggested and a way found for the public and private sectors to cooperate, to promote competitiveness and to improve European citizens’ access to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to believe that this report is just the beginning and that the Commission will respond not only to this specific report but also to the signs of the times, by taking the necessary initiatives with which, it should be added, the Council has also been preoccupied recently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come at just the right time to highlight the importance of the phenomenon of European cultural industries not only from an economic point of view – to which reference has been made – but also in terms of the potential they offer for cultural diversity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate, but we are not always aware of the economic significance of European cultural industries. I am referring to audiovisual, music and publishing services. A study carried out in 2001 on the employment potential of this sector estimated that 4.8 million people were employed by creative industries in the broadest sense, which accounts for 3.1% of employees in the European Union. The European audiovisual sector alone directly employs more than 1 million people. Therefore, in addition to their contribution to diversity, cultural industries contribute significantly to the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">They of course differ from other industries in that they have an obvious social and cultural role. They have to do with creation. They involve producing and selling not products, like other industries, but cultural goods. These goods are the expression of an identity; they are reference points. Therefore, as far as cultural industries are concerned, normal industrial policy cannot play the same role, not being adapted to these industries. We need to look beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity presupposes a solid and varied industrial fabric that guarantees pluralism in the cultural supply within a global market. This phenomenon alone shows the importance that needs to be attached to this sector of activities that relates to our identities. I would like to mention some key actions to demonstrate to you that Europe is paying attention to this sector, not only within the framework of cultural programmes, but far beyond them.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all aware of the MEDIA programme and the work we do for film, but did you know, for example, that in the Culture 2000 programme, the support provided for publishing houses to encourage literary translations has benefited 1 300 translations in the past years? Did you know that a large proportion of the Structural Funds is used to develop the cultural industry? For example, in the Swedish town of Hultsfred, the ERDF cofinanced projects aimed at developing the music industry. Since then, the town has become the rock capital of Sweden! As you can see, European aid can result in genuine, concerted and concentrated development of cultural industries. Indeed, in your report, you call for a communication on the Structural Funds and culture, a communication that will highlight these types of actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that since 2002 we have also been developing experimental measures designed to support the music and book industries. For instance, we have the project to increase exports of European music outside our continent. You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen, that these cultural industries are being supported only by EU programmes and actions. I must add that we will soon have a unique opportunity to strengthen this action when we discuss the extension of the MEDIA and CULTURE programmes and the new generation of programmes. To this end, with Parliament’s help, we will have to envisage very systematic action so that the creativity of this sector can encourage economic and cultural diversity and, thus, our European roots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the final report, as adopted in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, incorporated the more important elements of my Committee's contribution. I refer in particular to the emphasis on the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a long involvement with cultural industries in Ireland, in particular local industries which promote the Irish language, traditional music and culture of my own region in the West of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs in the field of culture are clearly more vulnerable compared with similar sized companies in other spheres. These SMEs frequently produce, what are in effect, public goods. In other words, their products offer benefits to society as a whole above and beyond any commercial value. Such SMEs frequently face difficulties in assessing finance, particularly in the start-up phase.</p>
<p class="contents">If you combine the uniqueness of the cultural sector with the fact that such industries are often located in peripheral and rural regions, it is clear that the question of providing adequate finance must be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like Member States to look at what policy instruments could be used to promote cultural industries. Parliament has previously stressed the need to reduce the legislative and administrative burden on SMEs, simplifying the collection of data for tax collection and reducing unnecessary red tape, especially for the self-employed and small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">One point of Mrs Zorba's report that I particularly welcome is the call for a revision of the 'De Minimis' rules on State Aid. Such a review would take into account the unique situation pertaining to SMEs in the cultural sector, particularly those in peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to make one particular plea in relation to the policy on the information society. Priority must be given to the development of broadband Internet access to rural and peripheral regions. This, would help create a more level playing field for the many cultural related SMEs based in these regions</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, today we are seeing the emergence of cultural industries with an ever-increasing economic dimension, which also play a vital role in Europe’s cultural diversity and identity.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems raised by this report is the total absence of a precise definition of cultural industries and of any European industrial strategy in this area. The Commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us, perhaps by way of the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, we will have to increase aid for cultural industries in projects for the economic development of regions and towns, through the Structural Funds, and also by encouraging private and public partnerships. Similarly, the European Union will have to establish support measures for SMEs and independent enterprises, which play an important role in the area of artistic creation and production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise here the importance of the printed word, and in particular of the regional daily press. That is what best guarantees linguistic and cultural diversity and is the most overlooked of the Union’s cultural policies. It is vital that when the Commission is drawing up its Green Paper it should at long last put forward proposals to actively support this sector, which is also essential for pluralism. In the same vein, the Commission will have to propose specific measures to combat media concentration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I feel that it is now time to mobilise our efforts to ensure that the proposed UNESCO convention on cultural diversity can soon see the light of day. More than ever, we must promote a European cultural spirit in order to encourage creation and bolster cultural diversity, without which Europe would not exist nor have any influence abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This deficiency is due, in my opinion, to fundamental causes.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council’s fear of denationalising these policies, which some consider as signs of national identity. The other reason is the governments’, and also the Commission’s, fear of using Community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works.</p>
<p class="contents">People avoid talking about culture or art in economic terms when, on the contrary, it should be argued that the cultural industries create employment and generate wealth for Europe. If we include the audiovisual field and cultural tourism in the culture sector, it is by far the most important sector for the European economy. I address this, without much hope that they read the Minutes, it is true, to the Finance Ministers and also our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">As requested by Mrs Zorba, the Commission must quantify these aspects and consider them when drawing up its policies, not only the directly cultural ones but also the economic, social and territorial ones. Furthermore, Commissioner, you should demand that your colleagues take this approach to territorial policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is also becoming necessary to restrict the commercialisation of culture. You will perhaps remember that a few years ago one of the best museums in the world, the property of one of our Member States, was renting out its rooms when the museum was closed – rooms exhibiting humanity’s greatest works – for weddings and other social events. This was a depressing and alarming example. Within the European Union, the economic exploitation of cultural resources must be compatible with their historical and artistic dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these aspects and many others are dealt with in this report, and I warmly congratulate its author on its timeliness and quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We worked well together and managed, via a poll, to gain more insight into the finer points of the cultural industries. It is clear that there is much room for improvement, certainly at European level. The cultural industries are, after all, of great economic significance, and offer much scope for employment. On this basis, I should like to call for culture to figure more prominently in the Structural Funds; SMEs in particular might benefit from this. Culture is also, however, an expression of our national identity. In a united and, soon, enlarged Europe, it is important for us to be aware of this cultural diversity. Museums in all manner of areas are trying to accommodate this, but unfortunately, they are hindered in most European countries by the sometimes exorbitant premiums they have to pay for the exhibits on display. This gives museums in countries where this is not the case a major advantage in the organisation of outstanding exhibitions. This is, in my view, a clear form of distortion of competition, and it must be stopped; it prompts me to urge the Commission to map out the differences in indemnity regulations in the present and future Member States, and subsequently to table a proposal for more streamlined regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for a united Europe to have an elitist group of citizens who are well-informed on what Europe has to offer in terms of culture, while others have to remain deprived of all the fine things that the cultural industries in other European countries have produced and are producing. Thank you. I should therefore like attention to be given to these indemnity regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a society in which everything can be bought and sold, culture is in immediate danger of commercialisation, which changes its nature. Cultural creation is no longer the art created either collectively by society or by gifted people. It is becoming a product which is produced and sold, so that it can be converted to business profit, as well as a means of ideological guidance of the peoples, by promoting a specific way of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, approaching culture in terms of the industry, the market and added value, as if we were talking about cars or oranges, is very dangerous. Of course, the report expresses a number of concerns about cultural diversity. However, it is not these that determine its content, it is concerns that the European art markets have lost an important share of the global market, that the European Union has not yet developed its potential as regards the trade in cultural commodities. Company mergers are considered dangerous not because they result in monopoly control, but because they jeopardise market transparency. Even piracy is condemned not as theft of intellectual work, but because it deprives these industries of vast revenues, impacting on future investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals are in keeping with the concerns expressed. The report calls for the intervention of the Commission and the Member States not in order to strengthen artistic creation and protect it from commercialisation, but in order to strengthen companies and promote the competitiveness of the European industries. This sort of intervention will further institutionalise culture and put it under even greater control by the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments proposed by our political group, in a bid to mitigate somewhat the consequences of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I appreciated the principles, the values that are the basis for the report itself, in other words the need to recognise culture as having a principal role in the European Constitution. Indeed, the motto ‘united in diversity’ only makes sense when interpreted in light of the wealth and diversity of identities and of cultural and historical roots which are the heart of our European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, however, European cultural heritage is neither appreciated nor exploited sufficiently, even though there is no doubt that it represents an area of great potential, not least from an economic point of view. I fully agree that it is necessary to begin by detailing a comprehensive study seeking to fix a European plan of industries and of cultural productions and activities and subsequently to implement a genuine inventory of European artistic and cultural heritage. It would be a step on from the past, even the recent past, when the Commission declared that it had neither instruments nor competence, thus relegating culture to an exclusively national responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by drawing attention to some important points in the report: firstly the reduction of VAT on music goods to boost sales and, in the meantime, to reduce trading of pirate products; secondly, greater focus on young artists, in terms of both training and promotion; thirdly and finally, greater investment at European level and more regulations, not least to facilitate European cultural enterprise financially, for example through the option of deducting the reinvested profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their contribution to the Lisbon objectives is undisputed. Apart from creating wealth and jobs, the cultural industries, by their very nature, promote initiative and innovation, which are valuable factors for the competitiveness of the European economy. Their development can also help in particular in reversing isolation, by developing local societies, because it makes use of their comparative advantages and can easily be linked to tourist development and promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the cultural industries have sectors which can create employment opportunities, especially for people affected by unemployment, such as young creators or women and the disabled. That is why I agree with the rapporteur that use should be made of the cultural contribution of the Structural Funds, especially now with the mid-term evaluation of the 2000-2006 programming period, so that we can take additional or corrective measures, such as promoting vocational training and, of course, promoting education at higher learning level, because in many countries, such as my own, Greece, it is inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until 11 this morning, there were no reports at all, something that seems to have something to do with the reorganisation of the press service.

The diversity and quality of culture and the capacity to participate in cultural creation are elements of a democratic society that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, public intervention is crucial. Financial support must be provided for cultural creation and production in order to ensure diversity and vitality and to avoid concentration in the hands of a few, often American, multinationals. Today, though, systems of public aid are threatened by the thinking that makes the market pre-eminent over everything else.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, these systems may be considered to be ‘State aid’ prohibited as being contrary to European competition law, which is sacrosanct. We must regret, in this respect, the result of the Convention, which leaves the existing texts as they are instead of promoting aid for culture to the ranks of aid that is automatically authorised. A formidable sword of Damocles thus hangs above our cultural policies.</p>

As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, however, I can only underline the fact that questions of gender, development and combating poverty are interrelated. The Commission should, therefore, incorporate into its development policy specific goals relating to education, health, gender equality and combating poverty. The financing of female participation in business should be promoted. Moreover, the reduction of child mortality and maternal mortality, as well as measures to fight violence against women, genital mutilation, rape of girls and trafficking in human beings, should always be included in development policy. The Commission should ensure a gender-balanced participation in projects, with a special regard for areas where discrimination against women is most severe.</p>

Under these conditions, the very title of the report, which refers to development policy, is an insult to these hundreds of thousands of human beings whose situation, rather than improving, is only getting worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the report dares to welcome the Commission’s emphasis on poverty reduction is a further insult. The amount of aid provided is pitiful; it comes nowhere near the amounts the pillage of these countries yields to oil, building and maritime traffic trusts and the countless European enterprises that are growing rich on the meagre wages paid in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for specific measures to protect indigenous populations. Quite apart from the language, which is redolent of colonial times, what the poor countries, and particularly Africa, must be protected from above all, is these predators, the large cartels…</p>

<p class="contents">It is a great tragedy that the languages of Duncan Ban MacIntyre and Robert Burns have become more or less foreign languages to the children of Argyllshire and Ayrshire respectively, and other parts of Scotland. These are examples from one country of a universal European problem. I am very glad that at the Convention I had the chance to help put respect for linguistic diversity into the objectives of the Union, if we adopt the draft Constitution. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is helpful too. But we need proactive help and that is what the Ebner report promises. I hope that the Commission will take that up. I am very pleased with the result of that vote and to have taken part in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Michl Ebner from the South Tyrol is successor to a long line of great reports adopted by this House on this subject since the 1980s, beginning with the Arfé Report, produced by a great Social Democrat from the Valle d’Aosta. I rejoice in it. It was the eastward enlargement that made it necessary to send out a clear signal concerning these matters, for a very large number of minorities and ethnic groups will be finding their way to us: Hungarians in Slovakia, Germans and Poles in the Czech Republic, Poles in Lithuania, Lithuanians in Poland, and so on. Taken together, members of the minorities will, numerically speaking, be the second largest Member State in the enlarged EU, after Germany but before France. That shows the immensity of this issue in quantitative terms, and even in qualitative terms it is of great significance, as these minorities can become either the mortar in the foundations of the EU or an explosive charge. We want them to be the mortar that holds us together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any erosion of this diversity would constitute an impoverishment of our cultural heritage.

<p class="contents">However, the draft resolution is explicitly based on the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The Flemish Government has always refused to sign this agreement – with good reason – since French-speaking Belgians who have moved to Flanders want to misuse it in order to have French recognised as an official language in Flanders. This is in conflict with language legislation that has been established with great difficulty and the principle of territoriality in Belgium. It mainly concerns people who refuse to fit in with the Dutch-speaking character of the region, and who, in fact, turn failure to teach another language – in this case Dutch – into a political point of debate.</p>

Moreover, those languages are the central nucleus of the linguistic and cultural rights recognised by that draft Constitution and also by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, I want to draw attention in particular to the need to add the official languages of the Member States to the list of official languages of the Union. An example from within the Spanish state is Catalan, a language spoken in an area containing ten million inhabitants, and recognised by Parliament, in the Reding report, as deserving special treatment given its importance and standing at the heart of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sad fact that successive Spanish Governments have failed to champion the official languages recognised by the relevant Statutes of Autonomy, earmarking for development the principles and rights of the Spanish Constitution itself. For that reason, it is very important that it should be the European Union that recognises and protects these languages, over and above the positions of governments.</p>

There are currently 40 million EU citizens who speak a language other than the official national language, and next year they will total 46 million. For the children and grandchildren of migrants, the language of the environment will become their first spoken language. This does not apply to stateless peoples or to people who live in pockets of society on the other side of the state border that separates them from those who speak the same language. Within Europe, there has been a long-term battle for education, administration and work in the citizens' own national language. People without this opportunity end up in the position of second-class citizens. The first-class citizens are those who speak the prevailing language at home or who have completely adapted to it. Within the EU, a stark contrast is starting to emerge between peoples who now have their own Member State and peoples who are treated as minorities within states that predominantly speak a different language. The language of this latter group is still not being recognised within the EU, unless it happens to be the same of that of the neighbouring country. For example, the ten million Catalan-speakers will continue to wonder why their language counts for less than the much smaller languages of the Danes, Finns, Baltic peoples and Slovenians. We will soon face major conflicts unless a solution is found in good time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that even the European Union is turning into a totalitarian regime that is selective in who it holds accountable and prosecutes.

<p class="contents">I feel that it is intellectually and politically unjustifiable to assess Cuba’s position without considering the unremitting aggression instigated by the United States and endured by the island for the last 40 years. That aggression has been made manifest in all kinds of acts, including terrorist acts, which have been condemned by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy of aggression has intensified recently, giving rise to justifiable concerns on the part of the Cuban authorities, especially now that pre-emptive war has risen to the status of a White House doctrine and the invasion of Iraq has taken place. The threat of virtual war, endured by Cuba for so many years, has thus grown into the threat of real war. We might criticise some of the reactions to this threat — we have done so — but that does not mean we should not try to understand them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cubans are convinced of two things, and I agree with them: the first is that the European Union treats Cuba differently from any other country in the same economic circumstances as Cuba, and even from any other country with a similar regime to Cuba. The Cubans are also convinced, as I am, that this discriminatory policy is not a matter of coincidence. Rather, it is encouraged by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is essential to rethink our policy towards Cuba, with the immediate aim of regaining credibility and trust among all the Cubans with whom we have dealings. That does not mean we should hide our worries, our criticisms and our hopes of seeing the Cuban people progress. It does, however, mean that we should express those thoughts with the same respect, independence and coherence we show other countries, from Israel to Morocco, Russia to Latvia, Argentina to Guatemala, and even from China to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if the European Union restores trust and credibility, shows understanding and solidarity, will it have the necessary influence to help things get better in and with Cuba. Resolutions like this one do nothing to help us in that task of restoring credibility and trust, either in Cuba itself or in the rest of the developing world, for which Cuba is still an important point of reference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It became clear that what the selectively over-sensitive Euro-unifying hypocrites cannot forgive socialist Cuba is not the so-called authoritarianism of the socialist regime or any weaknesses in it, but the fact that Cuba, despite the open war and the forty-year criminal embargo by the imperialists, is maintaining and continuing to improve the standard of living and education of its people, which is the highest in the whole of Latin America, that socialist Cuba and Fidel Castro are a beam of light, a source of fighting inspiration to the peoples in the area and mankind as a whole.</p>

This turned me into a supporter of Fidel Castro even before he took over state power at the end of 1958. I still think that the alternative society that has been created since then in Cuba, which has managed to assert itself surprisingly well in the face of American attempts to starve and destroy this alternative, is valuable. It is neither money nor economic power play the lead in that country, but solidarity and the equality of all people. This solidarity and equality cannot, however, justify the long-term prison sentences and death penalties that are meted out to silence those who, in the eyes of the regime’s supporters, do not display solidarity or who threaten equality. Even if the present Cuba were some kind of paradise, which it is not, paradise cannot be defended in that way. Such violations of human rights do not convince anyone, but only lead to bitterness among those who they wish to eliminate. They are the wrong answer to the undermining campaign organised from within the USA. Serious violations of human rights cannot be condoned, not even if they are perpetrated by people who originally had similar political objectives.

I did so because the Cuban people still lacks the most basic civil, political and human rights, just when we thought we had seen the last of the ramifications of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The European Parliament had to take a firm political stand against Fidel Castro’s regime. I wanted to contribute to that goal, because the Cuban people live under a dictatorship which has chosen to turn in on itself rather than open up, to imprison rather than set free. If there is one people still asking to be set free in 2003, then, it is the Cuban people. The dictator’s latest pronouncements, in which he displayed the irresponsible attitude we have come to expect from him by spurning all European Union assistance, are thus all the more deplorable.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, I would like to conclude by recalling that the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas in 2002. In doing so, it sent a political message to the Cuban regime: we in Europe were also watching to see how matters developed. In 2003, the regime responded to that message by taking more political prisoners, by continuing to violate human rights and trample the rule of law under foot. This resolution requests that Mr Payá Sardiñas come to Europe and explain in person what is happening in Cuba. The regime will not let him. It is our duty not to abandon him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found it particularly satisfying, moreover, to see what we are calling the ‘Sakharov Initiative’ finally ratified, and thus approved by an overwhelming majority in Parliament, in paragraph 2. Under this initiative, it is proposed that we once again invite Oswaldo Payá, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2002, to Europe, and welcome him at the highest level. This is a joint initiative by the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud to have been responsible, together with other honourable Members, for launching this initiative in May. Little by little, it attracted growing support in Parliament, with 205 individual signatures by July, until its eventual adoption and ratification in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council and the Commission will now follow it up properly. Along with many of my fellow Members, I really believe that the great symbolic significance of the support eventually mobilised by this ‘Sakharov Initiative’, combined with its ratification, may result in a marked, decisive improvement in the situation in Cuba. It may be just the catalyst for change that has been lacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to clarify that in the Gujarat massacre of March last year, many of the victims were also of Indian origin. Furthermore, it is wrong to refer to the threat of increasing Hindu fundamentalism. This gives a distorted view of the situation in India. After all, that country is the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model. A choice of this kind clearly demonstrates tolerance for the different population groups. There are exceptions in every society, but this is no reason to generalise and brand the Indian society as a whole as fundamentalist. India is an open, tolerant and pluralist society in which religious freedom forms part of the constitution.

Even though it is in fact the issue of human rights that leads me to sit in this House, I voted against both of them. The reason for this is the fact that the issue has, unfortunately, been misused for ideological reasons. My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bos report, we have taken an unambiguous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, whilst at the same time treating the statement by Cardinal Ratzinger and the Catholic Church on same-sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights. This just shows the ideological misuse of the issue of human rights. European society is founded not only upon the inviolable dignity of the person, but also upon the inviolable dignity of marriage and the family, the defence of which is one of our tasks as politicians. Future reports on human rights should protect marriage and the family, rather than calling them into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is getting under the EU Member States' feet with the suggestion that human rights policy should be dealt with at Community level. The report should have confined itself much more to enforcing human rights clauses in association and cooperation agreements, and to assessing their effectiveness. In this respect, the European institutions – the Council, the Commission and Parliament – should definitely search their own hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is right to denounce increasing extremism and fundamentalism, but fails to separate these expressions of perverted religion from religion itself. Anyone who does draw this distinction need not make a forced effort to keep religion out of political debate. Moreover, it then becomes immediately clear that the ideologies of socialism and liberalism are also subjective philosophies. Non-belief – not adhering to any faith – is also based on a choice of faith. Democratic politics is therefore never impartial.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to note that international human rights standards, however valuable they are, are not the ultimate standard against which human action will be judged. After all, the basis of this law lies in the human person, as if man were autonomous and made the law for himself. This subjectivity puts the universal claims of such law into perspective. According to my political belief, objective and universal law are only based on the Ten Commandments given to mankind by God, the Creator of all life. It is fortunate that a huge number of legal standards that apply in our European societies to this day are based on this. It would be sensible simply to recognise this. Only then can something positive be expected from an inter-religious or inter-cultural dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe should look at America to see how things are not done. For years, American human rights policy was geared to punishing countries that strayed off course and to rewarding governments in countries where America had military and economic interests. In the former case, minor human rights violations used to be put under the microscope while in the latter, major violations were hushed up, denied or glossed over as much as possible. In the developing world, human rights were therefore put on an equal footing with the ability to follow the 'American way of life', particularly the existence of free competition, to which the involvement of all in democratic government, equality and solidarity were made entirely subordinate. Oppressive dictatorships were backed for fear of mass rebellion. Although the European states have not gone to such extremes in most cases, its current relations with the dictatorships in China and Iran are very clearly based on its own self-interest. For the governments in Russia, Turkey and Israel, it will become easier to oppress Chechens, Kurds and Palestinians when the EU wants to be on good terms with them. This report is a valuable contribution to change, but will anything actually happen? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report is defective in this respect. In Sweden, an unaccompanied child sent back to his or her home country must always be accompanied by someone who will make sure that they are received by a relative or someone else responsible for their care. Before a child is sent back to his or her home country (or another country), a careful investigation is made into who is to assume responsibility for them and receive them upon arrival. Unaccompanied children must always be assigned reliable people. The problem is that, at present, it takes a long time to appoint such people, who are then assigned to too many children. Better account must be taken of the child in such investigations. Sometimes, not enough is found out about what happened to the child in his or her country of origin.</p>

Major differences of opinion, however, remain about the ambition to ban political groupings on account of 'extremism' or 'separatism'. In the future Member State of Latvia, people who had failed to resign their membership of the then governing Communist Party eight months prior to independence were denied any political rights. In the Basque country in Spain, a newspaper and a popular political party are banned, and the results of elections are heavily doctored because the excluded political grouping cannot in any way put forward candidates. In Turkey, a potential future Member State, it is a matter of course that organisations and publications are banned, opponents end up in prison and regions are destroyed in order to be able to control them more efficiently.

Indeed, apart from anything else, the ideological slant of the Sylla report makes it unbalanced and partial in terms of fundamental rights. Notwithstanding, there was one important argument which I could not put forward yesterday due to the scant speaking time available to me. It relates to the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the rapporteur claimed was the central principle of his report, is aimed at the institutions and agencies of the Union, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and also at the Member States. The charter only applies to the latter however, when they are implementing Union law, as Article 51 makes clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore have liked – though this was not the approach favoured by the rapporteur – to see this report aimed directly and primarily at the institutions and agencies of the Union. In other words, we wanted an appraisal of those actions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament itself which had an impact on fundamental rights in the EU, and which decided or implemented policies affecting those rights.</p>

It questions the responsibility of large international organisations that dismantled public services, leading to this situation. It has, however, found a majority in this House by getting rid of some of the content of the resolution through amendments that refuse to point the finger and, therefore, beyond good feeling, has used its influence to push for a real improvement in the standard of living of those affected. The adoption of Amendment No 15 which ‘stresses that the key issue is not whether water provision is organised by a public or private entity but rather the specific obligations provided by the policy framework; considers that it is up to the public authorities in developing countries to define the legal framework for regulating the work of private operators’, changes the essence of the report. It is the commercialisation of this common good that is at the root of these inequalities of access, of the shortage and excessive cost in developed countries as in developing countries.

The observation that the key to development lies in liberalising trade should, rather than earning enthusiastic applause or violent condemnation (both of which lead only to ideological squabbles with short-term effects), be nothing more than a point of departure and a frame of reference. Given this inescapable truth, therefore, the best approach is to link certain obligations into trading relationships maintained with developing countries. In other words, it is better to impose conditions on aid offered by the EU and/or its Member States to those economic agents who, by acquiring raw materials or by selling goods and services, establish trading relationships with developing countries. These conditions would involve providing instant attendant benefits, which might consist, in practical terms, of obligatory technology transfers, building local capacity, providing medicines, building basic infrastructure, providing services to help reduce the costs of managing debts, and the like.</p>

<p class="contents">Since Europe, as we are continually declaring, is based on the values of humanism and solidarity, we need to put these noble sentiments into practice. We need to help those who are suffering; we have the means to do so. Medicines to start with, to put an end to the deaths of over 28 000 children under five years old who die every day from illnesses that can be treated, many of them easily.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also help and support the sick who are victims of AIDS with treatments that we have for patients in Europe, but which are too expensive for developing countries. Is there any greater inequality than that in the face of an illness?</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the financial means. How can we remain impassive when, for example, the funds that we have earmarked for development are not used and these amounts could save human lives…</p>

<p class="contents">Interaction between the different actors – local, institutional and others, such as civil society – is indeed increasingly important, at national and international levels. It is one way of obtaining the answer which is still urgently needed if we are to help the world’s least-favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made this general observation, I must nevertheless point out, in relation to the rapporteur’s comments on the ever-greater cuts in Community assistance to various NGOs, that the participation of non-state actors is not in itself a guarantee that development policies will be effective. We must encourage greater participation and involvement on the part of actors who neither support ideological or programmatic campaigns nor promote their own agendas, but rather are truly generous, disinterested and altruistic in their aims, and whose actions consequently bear the most real and tangible fruit on the ground.</p>

Care must also be taken to consider the state of today’s technology, since it allows television content to be disseminated using different technological platforms, and therefore requires the relevant legislation to be adapted and updated.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to adopt a flexible approach to regulation and set minimum regulatory standards for the sector is equally pertinent and correct, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s concerns about the concentration of ownership and control of television broadcasting, since I see these developments as a challenge to pluralism and cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I take particular exception, however, to the establishment of a Pan-European Children’s Network. I feel that the task of ‘welcoming’ our youngest viewers into the audiovisual world should be left to national channels. I do not believe that a ‘European consciousness’ can be created by suppressing national languages and identities and indoctrinating babes-in-arms with artificial ‘European’ values. The European Union should resist the temptation to ‘mould’ the loyalties and characters of the citizens of the Member States.</p>

It aims to contribute to a resolution of the ongoing conflict, along with other international partners, and in close collaboration with the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the difficult circumstances in which the business communities are currently working in the Middle East region. At the same time, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and therefore the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm then that in applying the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the EU relies on international law for the territorial definition of the State of Israel, thus excluding the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Therefore, products originating in these areas are not entitled to benefit from preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Following confirmation from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal of the European Union in November 2001, in order to inform them of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the provisions of the bilateral agreement, it is the responsibility of the customs administrations of the EU Member States to check the origin of goods with the Israeli authorities through the post-verification procedure. It is also their responsibility to take the necessary precautions where a customs debt is due. It is in this context that the recovery of duties is now undertaken by the customs administrations of the Member States. These measures, initiated by the Commission, aim to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I can only reiterate that the Commission has always declared its willingness to cooperate and examine any technical proposal from the Israeli authorities to find a solution for this issue which would respect the terms of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, one can conclude that the Commission has taken the necessary measures to ensure correct application of Community law. As a result, Member States are imposing duties on products from the settlements. We keep this regularly under review with Member States' customs authorities and we are also continuing to talk to Israel about technical issues related to customs certificates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East. Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers, I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law, making the resolution of that problem even more intractable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process. Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that, unfortunately, such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States. The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake. No one summed up the implications better than Commissioner Patten himself in a debate in this House in May 2001. It is important to put it on record again, and I quote him: 'The European Union's position on settlements is clear: all settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace. The Commission communication (of 1998) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights 'contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law'.' That says it in a nutshell.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said. The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today. One does not get the impression that this issue has been pursued vigorously enough by the Commission as a whole nor, indeed, by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said with regard to Israel that at the moment at best it is not being as cooperative as it could be in providing full details on the origin of all products and their component parts to customs authorities. At worst, it could be said that Israel is defying its trade agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten, to some extent echoed today, we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action. Therefore, while I welcome what the Commissioner has said, I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the European Union is so weak in exerting its pressure on Israel to comply with international law is reflected in the fact that new agreements have been made with Israel in recent times. I would like to touch on those.</p>
<p class="contents">I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana, on behalf of the European Union, to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations, but the European Union is undermining his efforts, in my view, by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended. The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement. Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel's compliance with human rights provisions, nothing tangible has been done, to my knowledge. Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements, and these are for export to Community markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products. This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement, while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community's political will to maintain this position is not convincing to Israel and certainly not convincing to me and many others in this House, while it fails to ensure the correct implementation of the existing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government. In the economic sphere two things need to happen: steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports. Both these steps require the political will of a united Commission. I am not convinced that the Commission is united on this matter and the consent of the Member States is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that in making these comments I acknowledge that the responsibility to make peace is shared with the Palestinian leadership. It must ensure that all possible steps are taken to end the vicious suicide bombings that have caused so much Israeli anguish and hardship and have hardened attitudes behind an irresponsible Israeli Government. Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address two points made by the Commissioner. He said that Member States are applying duties on settlement goods. My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods, and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the post-delivery verification system, once Israel declares where the goods come from, there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No other explanation can justify the proofs of origin being issued to both manufactured and agricultural products – produced in settlements – which we consider illegal and therefore not covered by the agreement. These include chives, non-woven textiles, wine, snack foods and so on. Although they are given customs access by the EU, they are actually produced in West Bank settlements such as Barkan, the Golan Heights settlement of Katzrin and the Gaza Strip settlement of Gush Katif.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new issue. We know that the Member States are unable to reliably distinguish which consignments are eligible and which are not. We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and exporters, and is trying to expand the list. We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify, when shipments are presented for clearance, what products they contain.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation cannot continue for two reasons. Firstly, Liberals attach great importance to rules; here we are seeing a consistent, persistent breaking of the rules. We recognise there are difficulties. The Commission and the Member States bear separate and full responsibility for this, since they both have obligations to act to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that those in the Commission who want to discharge their guardianship responsibility have insufficient political support within the Commission. The Member States that want to help have insufficient support in the Council. That is why this Parliament and the Member State parliaments need to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it is the duty of the government of Israel not to play tricks with a signed agreement. Israel should understand that this is not the time to do that. Unless they respect the clauses of the Association Agreement, the Israelis will have difficulty in convincing the rest of the world that they are acting in good faith in issues such as the peace process as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, therefore, just like to ask myself – and you – some questions. I wonder, firstly, whether the European Union’s efforts to pursue political dialogue and the participation of the quartet will be strengthened or weakened by the genuine reluctance on the part of the Commission to ensure that the protocol on origin rules and the territorial clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are enforced correctly. I am raising this point as I believe that it is fundamental. We have been debating this issue for years and there is no doubt that progress has been made, yet we are, once again, facing a blatant violation of this agreement. There are enormous obstacles to the peace process which, in my opinion, are due, firstly, to the policy of the Israeli Government, which is continuing with its settlements, following a policy of annexation and erecting walls. These obstacles are also, however, the result of the increasing violations of fundamental principles and the rules of international humanitarian law in Israel and Palestine. I believe that we should not give aid that allows agreements concluded not to be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to consider the reasons why Israel is violating the agreement, Article 2 of which calls upon Israel, and us, to respect it. We are responsible for ensuring that, on the basis of the agreement, our relations are founded on the respect for human rights and not on the violation of international humanitarian law. I believe that a politically appropriate, measured response from the Union to Israel’s persistence in issuing certificates of origin for products from the settlements should ensure that no product can continue to be given preferential treatment as an import into the European Union. If we give due weight to the statements of the Commission regarding preferential treatment of products imported from the settlements, then we see that Israel’s practice of issuing certificates of origin for these products is considered by the Commission to be a violation of the agreement. Nevertheless, this practice still continues. The agreement – the Commission has said so too – is not being enforced resolutely. I would like this issue of relations and legality to be addressed, because we need to end the situation of ‘anything goes’ that exists in Palestine and Israel. Israel needs to learn to enforce the agreements that it signs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past, the Commission has communicated on a number of occasions that the European Union does not accept Israel's illegal occupation policy. The Commission has also taken every opportunity to denounce the illegal application of the Association Agreement. A number of weeks ago, we received a response from Commissioner Patten to the effect that 'the Member States have informed the Commission that in a number of cases, import duties have been levied on goods that originated from the settlements and were imported with Israeli proofs of origin.' This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place. This is unacceptable. The Association Agreement with Israel has been drafted and must be observed with due regard to international law and to fundamental values.

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly explain that I am one of the signatories of this question; I did so as a democratic service for Mrs Sandbaek who asked me to do so. I do not agree with the opinion of the majority of the speakers but this question has been around for a long time in this House and it was important to clear the air and see clearly in this history of enforcement. Indeed, it is the question of the application of the Agreement and not of challenging it that is in the question from Mrs Morgantini and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The response from the Commissioner was very precise, completed further by the important clarifications given by Mr Belder. The Commissioner indicated that the application came from the customs authorities of the Member States. Mr Belder gave a very precise example of a Member State, which considers that this Agreement is being applied. Furthermore, there are appeal proceedings, which is the association council. If you have accurate details, Mrs Morgantini, you can communicate them to the Commission, who will not fail, I am sure, to mention them for the next Association Agreement. The rest are words and threats, which are founded on nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am slightly worried, Mr de Rossa, that you are using this occasion to challenge the Association Agreement with Israel, because that is not the aim of this debate at all. I am also astonished that you want the US to put pressure on Israel to respect human rights more, whilst you do not mention the pressure that the European Union could and should exert on the Palestinian Authority to stop the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We all heard Mr Arafat lamenting the current situation and transferring all the blame onto Israel, forgetting once again the fatal attacks of recent weeks. Now we all know the role that Hamas plays.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, just like the European Parliament, could give its support to Mr Mazen through budgetary aids or parliamentary incentives. Mr Mazen seems to show a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement. We can back him instead of continuing to back those who, like Mr Arafat, think that the terrorist attacks are part of normal policy in Palestine on its romantic road to freedom. What freedom? That, I will leave you to imagine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the legal point of view, on the one hand, it is quite clear that <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span> – treaties under international law are to be adhered to. We know which territory is internationally recognised as being Israel’s, we know which areas are occupied; we also know that products from Israel can be imported and that produce from the areas occupied by it cannot be.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, gathering evidence is very difficult; so, in practice, is knowing where to draw the line. The Commission’s answer has this to say on the subject: ‘These principles do not apply to products which have been sufficiently processed within Israel's internationally recognized borders.’</p>
<p class="contents">Does that, then, mean in practice that oranges harvested on the West Bank are processed in Israel, the juice bottled and exported to the EU? Is that what is meant by ‘sufficiently processed’? Or is it ‘sufficiently processed’ only if the juice is blended with that of apples and bananas in a mixed fruit cordial with the orange juice making up less than 50%? I think this shows us how difficult it is in practice to draw a distinction, even where the proportions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in this context, we should ask ourselves the important question as to whom this is meant to benefit. Does it do the Palestinians any good when an Israeli orchard, or a factory on the West Bank, is closed down? The workers there are laid off, and then the same production operation restarts in the Israeli heartland with immigrants from Russia. This, of course, does the Palestinians no good at all, but at least the position is clear-cut in legal terms. We have then maintained the legal position, but we have not necessarily helped the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ensure that the actions of the Commission or of the European Union do not make overall relations between Israel and the Palestinians worse than they already are. I am therefore in favour of the Commission continuing to act in these matters with the same caution and conscientiousness that it has demonstrated so far, never losing sight of the overall framework within which relations between Israel and the Palestinians are developing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have said more or less the same thing to us today, Mr Nielson. Although I share the idea that knowledge and an exchange of knowledge help build a better world, in the same ways as economic cooperation, I am particularly stupefied by this answer. Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament’s Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate. We all know that in paragraph 8 of the Resolution, Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to urgently convene the association council to give its position to the Israeli Government, by asking the latter to respect the UN resolutions, and, in this context, called for the suspension of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we, a year and a half after this demand was worded? When the Agreement began in 1995, just after the process in Oslo, some regarded it as helping to build peace. The situation now, however, is radically different. What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about? Partnerships can only be devised on the basis of mutual trust, and of shared rights and obligations. Now, the criminal attitude of the Israeli Government shows every day that it not only flouts the concerns of the Union, but also that it outbids the other in this fatal situation. More than a year ago now, Israel erected a wall in the West Bank allegedly for reasons of safety. In actual fact, it is an iron curtain that massacres the Palestinian territories and drives tens of thousands of inhabitants in their homes. In this way, new territories are being annexed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to give Parliaments’ Resolution tangible form. There are precedents. In 1990 the Commission enforced Parliament’s recommendation that scientific cooperation be partially frozen until the Palestinian schools and universities that had been closed unilaterally by the Israeli authorities were completely reopened and remained so. It was at least a few months before it was possible for them to reopen. Today, given that the clause on the respect of fundamental rights has been brutally violated, and in the sight of the whole world, in what way is this demand for suspension excessive?</p>
<p class="contents">In what way is it excessive to ask that this law is applied and respected?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I conclude Mr President, I am aware that the responsibility of the Council, shamefully absent today, is enormous. As, in theory, a member of the quartet, the Union has the means to carry weight. What it lacks is the political will to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commissioner also knows that once Israel has said that a product hails from Israel, there is very little customs offices can do about this, even when we know that we are being led up the garden path. Member States are not individually capable of enforcing what, in my view, is to be done, namely for Israel to stop labelling products which we know originate from settlements, but which are still given the label 'from Israel'. How difficult this is was once again demonstrated in this very Parliament when the Israeli Ambassador stated quite clearly that he challenges the EU's right to draw a distinction between products from Israel and those from the settlements. As long as this situation persists, I do not think it is up to the Member States, but up to the Commission, to do battle with the Israeli Government in order to force the latter into action, which Member States are not capable of doing. It is also up to the Commission to draw the necessary conclusions if Israel does not appear prepared to do what it is required according to EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The legal settlements are the main obstacle to peace.

However, now it is being used as a political instrument to bash Israel and the settlements. The author of the oral question has gone as far as calling for the suspension of the more recent 1995 agreement, even though the Commission has controversially agreed with her and imposed tariffs on goods allegedly exported by the settlements in the Occupied Territories. This is a technical dispute on trade and, although I am a friend of Israel, I support an eventual two-state solution and a dismantling of most of the settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Palestine is not yet a state competent to have its own trade agreements, which, controversially, the EU ratified in 1994. The Commission did this in spite of the fact that Israel had the signed agreement of the Palestinian Authority that Israel was responsible for customs matters for goods exported from the settlements. Nevertheless, there is also an EU-Palestine Free Trade Agreement. Therefore, whichever way you look at it, these goods should have EU tariff-free access as they come from territories covered by one or other free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">All trade agreements refer to the territory where the goods are produced, not the nationality or the religion of the producers. This whole dispute is now subject to a technical resolution under Article 79 of the Association Agreement, which is where it rightfully belongs. It should not be the subject of political manipulation within this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is engendering further hostility to trade with Israel and undermines Israel's faith in the impartiality of the EU as a vital component of the quartet in the quest for the Roadmap for Peace and the end of terrorism. I am sure that all sides of the House desire that outcome strongly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, eighteen months later, this Resolution is still being ignored. Could we see this as unwavering support for the Israeli state’s policy despite its violations of human rights and international law?</p>
<p class="contents">We could, for we are talking about economic, commercial agreements, about financial interests, but we also about the right to life. This colonial war claims more and more victims. Even though the roadmap made provision to colonisation to be put on ice, the Jewish colonies continue to grow and roads around them are still being built. In Israel the situation is tragic. The discrimination against some Israeli citizens is increasing; they are persecuted, denied certain rights because they are Arab Israelis. The Knesset enacted a law to prevent Palestinians from obtaining Israeli citizenship by marriage. This is a discriminatory and racist law. A recent report by FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights, has revealed to us a modern form of slavery of migrant workers. Even Mr Abraham Burg, a former President of the Knesset, raised the alarm. He said that Israel is a framework of corruption, based on foundations of oppression and injustice, which reduces itself to a colonist state, headed by a clique of individuals who are without morals, are above the law and corrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">In the occupied territories the situation is tragic. A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice, and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy. We are not, of course, going to count the deaths. Who are the victims of terrorism though, of this State terrorism that assassinates refugees on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I will say that we cannot remain silent. Is it not our duty to put pressure on the Israeli Government, with all the means that we have at our disposal including economic and commercial ones? Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this Parliamentary question is inappropriate and imprudent. We are in the midst of a peace process, the European Union is a member of the Quartet, and I believe that if we in the European Parliament and in the other institutions really feel solidarity with the Executive and with the figure of Mr Solana in his capacity as ‘Mr Common Foreign and Security Policy’, our representative, then we should support a rapprochement between the countries and not seek conflict between the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, furthermore, that this question implies a direct condemnation of the occupied territories. All of us in Parliament have done this before now: it is a commonly-accepted practice, and we also know that, in accordance with the Taba agreements on the devolution of the territories, many of those territories, which were once desert and will now be habitable, will pass into Palestinian hands.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me most is that this speech goes against the Palestinian Authority. Since Arafat and Abu Mazen are making constant demands for Europe to take a firmer stance in the peace process, and for that process not to remain in the hands of the United States, and if, as Mr Solana says, Europe really is one of the biggest contributors to Abu Mazen’s profile, why do we not, instead of creating divisions between the parties, devote ourselves to upholding Abu Mazen and his policies, to upholding the prestige of the European Union against the other side?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it does the peace process no favours for one of the parties involved to pick a fight with one of the other negotiators. Why are we not asking Mr Solana and the Palestinian Authority to strengthen the administration of the latter, and helping them both to achieve that aim? Why are we not demanding, and why is Europe not showing greater support for, public health and education services? That would prevent education from remaining to a large extent in the hands of a group like Hamas, which has been condemned for acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we not making a real contribution to strengthening the Palestinian Authority? That would be the answer. I would like to know what impact this question will have, since it will probably go against many Palestinian workers in the occupied territories. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the only possible approach and does not prevent the EU from presenting its own opinions and objectives within the framework of global partnership. In practice these are complex situations. What is more important is to understand the ordinary basic mechanisms which either hamper or encourage stability, just as Mr Schuman did when he put forward his brilliant genesis of an idea for the Communities that served as a basis for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would in this connection like to highlight one basic mechanism that has an effect on stability and peace: a clean environment. Clean water, as was shown in Jordan recently, is a vital necessity, and to attain it all the countries in the West Bank region must find a solution both separately and together. Unfortunately, the international community is still not even aware of the environmental destruction which is a reality in the West Bank. Excessive water extraction, conducting untreated waste water to Jordan, and the uncontrolled dumping of community waste have led to unthinkable health risks and a shortage of water.</p>
<p class="contents">The West Bank environment project is a multicultural and multilateral project which aims to solve major problems threatening the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the region. The project is not, however, making adequate progress. The reason is not low levels of finance or a lack of know-how and technology. The reason is chiefly that, for a project which is under way in a region occupied by three countries, there exists no political forum to agree on practical matters that are essential for its implementation, even though all the parties involved are agreed in principle on the needs and the measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">One may without exaggeration say that the EU is at present the only player in the world that could offer a political forum for attempts like the West Bank environment project to build stability and peace through action on the part of the inhabitants of the region. A neutral mediator is needed to initiate decision-making that overrides political controversies. If it were not for examples of voluntary action like the West Bank environment project, all the other work the EU does to implement the Middle East peace plans would be in vain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint. In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984, yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion. But, as several speakers have already said, we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country.</p>
<p class="contents">I have visited Gaza, because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN, and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now, when the borders are closed, Palestinian produce cannot move out of the Gaza Strip. I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city, where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe. There is a wonderful climate. It is potentially a great source of economic value to the Palestinian people, but every time there was trouble the borders were shut down and the produce was simply left to rot on the streets of Gaza. That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements – and that is a very real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the Israeli authorities have the means to eliminate the substantial distortions of the origin rules involving settlement products without causing further inconvenience to the EU, the Member States, Community operators and Israeli exporters. Perhaps without Israel's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU, short of suspending the agreement, is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I share the view that it was quite some time before the EU got to the point where these rules were being clearly applied. But we have been doing this for some time now and this fact needs to be clarified. I would also add that the political need for discussion and energy to be injected into the subject has more to do with what to do now than with the starting-point of the discussion which related to the actual administration of the customs regime.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Commission I do not recognise anything in our discussions or handling of this in the Commission that resembles what some have said here about questioning the unity of the Commission in relation to this issue. This has never been a divisive issue inside the Commission. Others have mentioned that Member States have to agree. That is absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbæk asked why the Commission has not officially informed Member States about this and what it is going to do. I will repeat what I said in my first contribution to this debate, namely that following the confirmation received from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal in November 2001 in order to inform them of the situation. So almost two years ago the Commission did what Mrs Sandbæk asked. This is one element on which I based my first remarks. It sounds as if this debate is about a war that was waged some time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In February this year – which was the time that the last internal Member States customs authorities met on this issue – about EUR 100 000 had been collected as permanent duties on these product categories from the beginning of 2003. We expect new figures to be available at the end of this month when the next meeting takes place. The amount of guarantees taken on these products by EU customs authorities at that time was as much as EUR 1.7 million.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are certain that the goods are coming from settlements, duties are applied immediately by Member States. Where there is any doubt, or where there is unclear or insufficient information about this from the Israeli authorities, we also apply duties after having checked as far as we can. This is being regularly reviewed within our Member States through the Customs Committee, which will meet again at the end of this month. This is something which is not just handled by putting a notice in the Official Journal; it is an active, ongoing process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Gahler asked about the modalities and principles of assessing the accumulation, and how much processing is necessary before it becomes an Israeli product. This is not the only place in the world where we have to decide on these matters. We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided. There is no special rule for Israel on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that significant sums, about EUR 44 million, were allocated to this aid project in both 2001 and 2002, and that the Commission has told us the results of the programme for those two years. It gives me particular pleasure to say, firstly, that efforts to diversify production increased during that period, and, secondly, that those efforts were based on incentives for agricultural and rural development projects. Both of these achievements fulfil or express desires noted as objectives by both the Commission and Parliament when this programme was approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I ought to mention, however, that some problems have been encountered. The Commission is undoubtedly aware of them, but they should be solved through the prompt adoption of certain corrective measures. Firstly, there have in some cases been significant and repeated delays, not attributable to any individual’s deliberate wishes, in mobilising and implementing appropriations over the last few years. These delays, however, have as a rule created significant difficulties for farmers in the producing countries, some of which are among the 40 poorest countries on the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these farmers have told us of their doubts and, particularly in the case of West African farmers, of their disagreement with the methods used by the Commission to assess farmers’ competitiveness, on which the Commission’s criteria for allocating appropriations are based. This assessment method takes into account average production costs, insurance and transport fleets as detailed by Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures, though, do not constitute a single definition. That causes mistakes of more than minimal significance in some cases. They are sometimes very significant mistakes, to the detriment of some of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am concerned at the decline in the amount of assistance allocated in the 2003 budget, especially as we approach the changeover from the current system to a tariff only system. That changeover may have very negative effects, not only on production in traditional ACP countries, but also on European banana-producing regions, if, when the moment comes for us to move from the current system to the tariff only system, we are unable to adopt the right measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by appealing for two concrete changes which are very important to Parliament and also, I hope, to the Commission: greater efforts to avoid any delays in payment from now on; and assessments of growing and production methods, with the aim of withholding funding from those projects having a negative effect not only on the environment but also on the health of banana workers in producing countries. The use of biodegradable substances in the banana-growing process should become a priority here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that this has been quite a problem in the start-up phase, but I can also inform you that the amount invoiced in 2002 was nearly EUR 41.5 million. This represents nearly seven times more than the amounts invoice in 1999 and more than three times the amount invoiced in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we cannot draw clear conclusions yet for the current year, the overall trend is quite positive and a similar disbursements of some EUR 40 million is expected for this year, taken as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now at a level of activity that corresponds reasonably well to expectations. All this is quite complex, there are so many different interests deserving protection, many historical, social and political factors in everything that relates to bananas. The Commission is well aware of the difficulties in combining the principle of equitable market access with consideration for the structural problems faced by small vulnerable economies. The Special Framework of Assistance stems from those concerns and addresses them in a tangible manner. Also it should be noted that this was not something imposed on our partners in this area but reflects thorough negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">After the undeniable difficulties of the start-up phase, substantial progress can now be observed in the implementation of the scheme: I have just given these figures. Now we have reached a satisfactory rate in terms of payment. In response to the repeated suggestions by the Commission, several ACP banana suppliers are changing their strategies and seeking more financial support to fund diversification where the banana industry is no longer sustainable. It is expected that this process will continue, with the least competitive banana suppliers using the available funds exclusively for diversification and social compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the possible increase in imports following enlargement, which is an important discussion, is concerned, it was agreed at the Copenhagen summit that appropriate arrangements would be made in order to ensure a sufficient supply of bananas to EU consumers in conformity with WTO rules. Any increase in the banana quotas, which would be subject to negotiations in the WTO framework, would take account of the interests of these producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of its obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement including those relating to ensuring the continuing outlet for ACP bananas on the European market and we are of course committed to do anything we can to respect this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank Commissioner Nielson for his statement.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur says, we have reached the final stages of a regime for protecting banana imports, which will come to an end on 31 December 2005. The European Union has managed to maintain special privileges for 12 small countries, as Mr Fernández has told us. Some of those countries, such as Somalia, Jamaica and Dominica, are among the world’s poorest, which is why they need our help.</p>
<p class="contents">That date, 31 December 2005, is very close. A guarantee and a tariff preference are laid down in the Cotonou Agreement; they will have to be honoured. Clearly, though, these banana producers will find themselves in trouble as the date approaches. What I mean to say is that there is every chance of the Community market becoming flooded with bananas marketed by multinational companies. Most importantly, the rapporteur has pointed out another danger, namely that enlargement will be used to justify granting even more preferential treatment to those multinational companies, opening up our markets to the detriment of both Community and traditional ACP producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Commissioner Nielson is at present aware of those problems. He mentioned that the amount of aid has remained at approximately the same level, about EUR 40 million, in recent years, and I do not know to what extent that amount could be altered to accommodate the needs arising as an inevitable consequence of the transition from a protective banana regime to an open regime subject only to the tariff restriction.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore reiterate my group’s support for Mr Fernández’s report, and hope that the Commission will continue to protect this small group of impoverished countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fernández Martín, and offer my support for his conclusions and ideas on the matter now under our consideration. I also offer my support to my friend and colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, who is also a fellow countryman of the rapporteur. In particular, I share his concern at the scantiness of the financial means available under this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to take this opportunity to raise a few basic points about the transparency and clarity of procedures in the way current legislation is implemented. It is unacceptable that the funds we are looking at should be allocated by Commission decisions that are not made public and which are based on an unnecessarily complex system of calculation, on the basis of somewhat erroneously defined concepts, using data of dubious rigour and comparability that are spread across two regulations and several articles and annexes.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of Community legislation must be clear, as simple as possible to enact and transparently implemented. As the Ivory Coast Banana and Pineapple Producers’ Association has rightly stated, however, this regulation does not fulfil these criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commission will inform Parliament of the decisions it has taken on funding organisations in the beneficiary countries, as well as the calculations informing these and the data it has used and even the legal basis and what it has done with the unused appropriations from budget line B7-8710. A simple and transparent legal framework is a crucial instrument, in this and in other fields, for developing a positive and lasting relationship between the European institutions and their partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Problems are shared problems: poverty, hunger, military conflict, immigration, transmissible diseases, ecological disasters and the like. Efforts to solve them must be coordinated and shared by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Here the question of development aid has become more important than ever. Now is exactly the right moment, to my mind, for the Commission to have produced its communication to the Council and to Parliament, which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The report I am presenting today, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation<span class="bold">,</span> is the fruit of work and contributions from political groups and from my fellow Members, for which I am particularly grateful and appreciative.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the European Union and its Member States constitute the world’s leading donors of government development aid. The traditional mechanisms of the European model have not, however, allowed the desired aims of cooperation to be achieved with complete success. It is difficult for us to ensure that the results are monitored or to assess them accurately, because the implementation of the programmes and projects is dispersed among both national cooperation agencies and fixed procedures which tie the receipt of aid in different ways to the acquisition of goods and services obtained by means of that aid in the donor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">According the World Bank’s figures, released here in this Chamber during a speech by the bank’s President, Mr Wolfensohn, the untying of aid would result in a reduction of transaction costs by up to 25%. We therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative, which may help to enliven the debate on this issue. That debate is currently being conducted among Member States and multilateral organisations. They are far from reaching an agreement which would be binding on all parties, and on the main donors in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced of the need, in this debate, to uphold the idea that aid priorities should suit the interests of recipient countries. That idea would seem almost too obvious to any observer, but it is not currently being put into practice. As a result, some European countries play a significant part in cooperation as official aid donors, but the money they make in return for delivering that aid exceeds their own contributions to the aid programmes, sometimes by a long way. This practice is known to all of us, I believe, and it is clear proof of a degree of cynicism among the donor countries – in other words, our own countries. We must make an effort, therefore, to try and remedy this state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, events do not take this kind of turn through a deliberate and evil desire for them to turn out badly, but for a whole range of reasons which cannot be gone into here. The main thing is that we use the experience we have acquired to push for these ideas to be implemented, bearing in mind certain considerations, such as those mentioned in paragraph 4 of our report, in order to ensure that our objectives are achieved and certain undesirable effects avoided. In other words, for example, it would be helpful if the Commission were to bear in mind the need for horizontal and geographical or regional budget lines to be treated equally, so as to introduce and guarantee open, transparent calls for tender, which do not always come about. These calls for tender will apply to all Member States and candidate countries, all developing countries and all developed countries, on condition that they are reciprocated by third countries and approved by the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by making express mention of a request made by many developing countries and NGOs. That request is that priority be given to the award of contracts to local suppliers or service providers in both the recipient country and neighbouring countries in the same region, on condition that provision is made for sufficient training to ensure that the projects are brought to a satisfactory conclusion rather than left frustratingly unfinished. The reasons for this are many and plain to see; it would be almost too obvious to list them, but they can be summed up by evoking the desirability of contributing to the development of local markets in those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> The communication about the untying of aid dates back to 18 November 2002 and we still have quite some work to do, even though we have made good political progress on the issue since last year.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue may appear to be very technical and difficult to address, but it can have quite an impact in the field concerning the effectiveness, the value for money of our aid and also the dynamics of the cooperation with our partner countries – exactly in the way Mr Fernández Martin has made clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the work he has done on this subject. His report reflects broad agreement between us. We have achieved consensus in Council on the untying of Community aid, and with the resolution on the table now in Parliament we can start working on implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will focus on concrete proposals to change the different relevant legal instruments. The proposal to implement changes in the existing regulations will fall under the co-decision procedure and therefore Parliament's role in moving this forward will be fundamental. I look forward to discussing it with Parliament during the course of this coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue our work on establishing the facts relating to untying. One of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete, reliable data on the impact of untying. We will begin a study on this before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will try to convince other donors who are still reluctant to join us, particularly through the work of the OECD ’s Development Assistance Committee and its new Working Group on Aid Effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">While welcoming the Council’s agreement on the untying of Community aid, I would like to express disappointment at the reluctance of some Member States – and especially that of one Member State – to commit themselves to untying bilateral aid. This has two dimensions; one is the well-established discussion as to whether or not official development assistance and the procurement there is part of the Single Market. This is an internal EU discussion. In the Commission's view the answer is clearly 'yes', the public procurement directive does indeed cover development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Some countries that have been doubting this over the years, including my own, clearly no longer doubt this. However, one Member State still maintains a different view. My reply would be 'okay, we will meet in Court'.</p>
<p class="contents">The other element where a discussion is more open and more legitimate is what Member States do in the broader global discussion in the framework of OECD about the untying of aid. There we have an agreement to untie aid to the group of least developed countries. The volume of what has been agreed on corresponds to about 2% of global ODA – not a big deal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is complying, and in fact over-achieving, in relation to what it has to do in order to carry out this agreement. But we take a different view: one reason being that we do not want to discriminate between least developed countries and the rest. We are ready to untie all aid and we have legal obligations vis-à-vis the ACP countries, for instance, which means that as a group, they have access to bid on everything relating to all seventy-eight countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparation for the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development, the Member States committed themselves to continue discussions on the further untying of bilateral aid. The Commission recognises that we need both to increase the volume of aid and its effectiveness through measures like those we are discussing today. I am really pleased to have the signal from Parliament and I look forward to moving this forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have to insist on some reciprocity, because this issue is also about taking care of trade interests opening up on our part, if, for instance, the United States is not doing the same thing. It is clearly not something we have a mandate to do. Our policy is now clear we want to go for the big solution on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he said, we now live in a world that is totally interdependent, and the problems of one country are problems for all of us, problems such as poverty, hunger, disease, ecological disasters and crime. It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid can play a pivotal role in working towards solutions, but only if it is free of trade commitments. The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid. Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness, but we need to acknowledge and recognise, as the Commissioner has made clear, that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice. We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices. Commissioner, may I say 'more power to your elbow!' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court, because we cannot have one Member State playing a different game from the others. We have, as you say, a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the need for reform. It will lead to increasing transparency and accountability. It is a complex process, and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation, hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step, but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid. The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction. So it is not an isolated concept, but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also ask Commissioner Nielson to convey my thanks to those involved in drafting the Commission communication. The text is clearly written and big-hearted in its tone.</p>
<p class="contents">The practice of tying aid may in theory even turn development aid completely on its head, with the donor benefiting and the country intended as the recipient becoming poorer than ever. Although this extreme paradox, which is well-known in economic theories, is not necessarily very easily possible in reality, it is nevertheless a reminder of the sort of reduced effectiveness and perversions of aid which still occur and are furthermore permitted in real life.</p>
<p class="contents">Estimates by the World Bank and the OECD of savings made through increased effectiveness are of the order of 25%. Our rapporteur estimates that the net benefit of untying could be the equivalent of as much as USD 5 billion in terms of cash. As we know how even small sums of money can work wonders in development cooperation, an increase of several billion euros of that sort is staggering. The European Union’s willingness to take the initiative in this matter is significant as the EU and the Member States are responsible together for half the world’s development aid. Reduced effectiveness in development cooperation is therefore by no means a trivial matter when measured in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to implement the conclusions arrived at in Barcelona swiftly. It should be self-evident that simple market economy principles dictate that the EU Member States should untie donor aid. The key competition principles agreed in the EU will work to the advantage of the developing countries in this. Then local sourcing and sourcing from other developing countries will also be possible, as we have already seen, resulting in a multiplier effect on the effectiveness of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the benefit in terms of welfare achieved in the developing countries, the liberalisation of procurement will also be important within the EU, because the practice of tying aid which still goes on in many Member States also distorts competition among the Member States themselves and is against the rules on competition in the EC Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a strategy document entitled ‘Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation’. This publication discredited the practice of imposing conditions on development assistance, showing it to be incompatible with the new guiding philosophy for initiatives in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, that philosophy has gradually taken on a definite, solid form through a series of important declarations and resolutions, such as the DAC’s recommendation, approved in May 2001, demanding that aid to the least-developed countries should be untied.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, the international community adopted the Monterrey Consensus at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002, committing itself to supporting initiatives designed to phase out conditional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication of November 2002, entitled ‘Untying: Enhancing the Effectiveness of Aid’, the Commission responds to just those promises made at Monterrey. It goes even further than the DAC’s resolution, since it extends the need to untie aid to all developing countries, not just to least-developed countries. It also extends the untying of aid to all aid sectors, including food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">All these recommendations are still gaining ground, under pressure from lobbying by the general public and by NGOs. They have not, however, made a great impression on a large number of countries, which are continuing to grant tied aid, either openly or covertly. This is unfortunately also true of various EU Member States. The result is a significant discrepancy between the policy advocated by Parliament and implemented by the Commission on the one hand, and the policy put into practice by some Member States, such as Spain under José María Aznar, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It comes as no surprise that the report presented by Mr Fernández Martín, a <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span> deputy in my country, should list a series of initial misgivings about the progressive approach urged by the Commission, an approach favourable to the untying of development cooperation policy. In the rapporteur’s favour, however, it should be said that he showed understanding and flexibility by accepting the amendments tabled to his first proposal, which have yielded substantial improvements in his final text.</p>
<p class="contents">That text includes a motion for a resolution approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation. We will be reasonably happy to vote for it, since it favours the complete untying of development aid, both European Union aid and aid granted by each and every one of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to Mrs Korhola's comments, it is true that many years ago the World Bank and UN stated that up to 25% of development assistance was wasted from the point of view of the recipient countries because of tying to the donor countries. This figure is not acceptable to the Commission because we have open competition between the 15 Member States, and adding a sixteenth does not really change the name of the game in terms of ensuring competitiveness when we are tendering. Therefore, the dynamics of this mainly revolves around a classical case of a single bilateral donor country tying or not tying. For the Commission, the dynamics of this, economically speaking, are not fantastic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that as a result of access to ACP countries, these countries have the right to bid on anything we tender relating to them. About 25% of all tenders are now being won by ACP bidders. This is good and is part of what Mr Fernández Martín talked about as being important to attain.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is true that food aid and the transport of food aid has – at the insistence of the US and via the decision in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD – been excluded from what should be covered by untying of aid. This is very sad and this is why we specifically refer to that problem as one of the elements in the broader topic of the untying of aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recently had a long and interesting conversation in Scotland with the Consul General for India and we were reflecting upon the problems in trying to constitute a polity which is continental in scale and multilingual in character, with citizens of many faiths and of none, with memories of historical antagonism between religious communities and which tries to sustain a working democratic constitution and to live at peace with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">We were thinking both of Europe and of India and it is humbling to us in the European Union, as we work towards improving our constitution, to think that India has achieved this continent-wide polyglot democracy in a secular polity for more than 50 years now. We have a lot to learn from India and we should approach today's debate with a certain sense of humility in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, evidently, as the horrifying events in Mumbai show us, all is not well in India. The issue of the capability to sustain a secular state with religious tolerance is now before us, as is the question of whether the tension with Pakistan will be cooled and whether intercommunal relations in India will become peaceful.</p>
<p class="contents">That sets the background to this admirable resolution which is before us today. Some of it in a sense merely states the obvious: of course we condemn the bomb attacks in Mumbai; of course we deplore the targeting of civilians; of course we feel great sympathy with the victims. We support the Indian Government in its fight against terrorism, but there is more to be said than that and some of it is said in my group's amendment to the resolution where we call for further steps to be taken to enforce Indian constitutional law properly and to prevent communal violence inside India. We are particularly aware, for example, of recent Amnesty International reports on problems in Gujarat and the responses to the 2002 massacre there. The Indian National Human Rights Commission has itself called for improved vigilance by the Indian authorities and for effective protection of constitutional rights. At the same time we welcome the Pakistani Government's assurance that it also deplores and has no time for the terrorist act in Mumbai.</p>

Last week's terrorist attacks in Mumbai might well spell the beginning of increasing violence between representatives of the religious communities. I certainly hope it will not. One of the suspects has already indicated that with this act, he wanted to take revenge for last year's anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which claimed the lives of 2 000 Muslims. Developments in India over the past fifty years had been typified by cultural diversity and a heterogeneous society. Over the past ten years, however, we have witnessed increasing alienation between Muslims and Hindus. The immediate cause is the issue involving the temple of the god Ram. The root cause, however, is to be sought more in the area of looming Hindu nationalism, where faith and national identity coincide. Hindus fear Muslims and Christians, particularly demographically speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, needless to say, friction with Pakistan is continually placing a heavy strain on relations between them, including in India. The Indian Government should take the problems seriously, and it appears now to be doing so. An escalation must be avoided at all costs. I have tabled an amendment in which the Indian Government is urged to draw up a plan of action in this respect. India is not the only country that is facing tension between religions. Almost half of the recent violent conflicts in the world have a religious dimension. Consequently, I have expressly asked for this issue to be highlighted in my human rights report. An institutionalised dialogue should be set up between the most important world religions. The European Union should also look into this issue. For a long time, India was a good example of the peaceful co-existence of religions. It should pull out all the stops in order to again become the peaceful, stable country which it had been for such a long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to take this opportunity to say – as Mr MacCormick said – that there is indeed more to be said on the matter, although it is crucial to start saying exactly what he said, but not, I believe, if this means raising further problems, albeit very real ones, concerning human rights in India. I do not believe that this is the appropriate time, place, or way to raise such issues, because what we do not need is an attempt to justify any form of terrorism against civilians, which is what has occurred in this case: we must condemn all such terrorist activities, whether the attack in Bombay or those that have placed Israel in a continual state of mourning, or, for example, the attack that took place in Buenos Aires, which the British judicial authorities are only now beginning to deal with, and are doing so extremely well, in a way that should be noted by all and which should, in fact, be the standard for all European political authorities. This is not, unfortunately, always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not hesitate to condemn terrorist attacks of this type and not attempt to justify them. Our condemnation of fanaticism must be clear, unequivocal and resolute. This is the message that I would like to make extremely clear, and this is why I do not believe that the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only did these bombings, which hit India's financial centre, claim the lives of 52 people, they also threatened to jeopardise the peace process in the region. It is regrettable that this should happen precisely at this moment in time, jeopardising the peace negotiations between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a much-wanted region by both countries. India has been making major efforts for some time to bring this conflict to an end. After all, the Indian Government’s policies are geared to the peaceful co-existence of the different nations, as illustrated by the number of Muslims occupying high government positions. India is, moreover, the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model. A choice of this kind is a clear expression of tolerance with regard to the various population groups. It goes without saying that this raises very important issues, which must be viewed in terms of India's importance, not only in Asia but also in the world. After all, we should not overlook the fact that India is a superpower boasting great economic potential and is also one of the European Union’s important trading partners. The objective of the violence was to destabilise society and deliver a blow to the Indian economy. The international community should concern itself more with increasing Muslim fundamentalism in the world. The recent attack against the UN headquarters in Iraq is a dramatic example of this. This incident underlines once more the enormous threat that is emanating from ever increasing fundamentalism. I take the view that the European Union and its Parliament have every reason to continue to support India as a constitutional state, where Hindus and Muslims are treated equally, in a bid to ensure respect for the principles of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned that while this is holding in the capital, there are still problems in the rural areas, with reports even today of tens of thousands of people fleeing into Monrovia from Totota in Central Liberia. That is hardly surprising, with the alleged massacres of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians perpetuated in Nimba County since the signing of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourteen years of violence and misrule in Liberia resulted in immense human suffering amongst civilians, as well as gross human rights violations, a breakdown in social and economic structures, and now 85% of the population is living below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrival of the peacekeeping force has enabled the peacekeeping process to start, but there is still a long way to go. We look forward and call upon all the parties to the agreement to implement it in good faith and to establish a transitional government as promised on 14 October 2003, that will hopefully lead to free and fair elections. We welcome the fact that the European Union has provided aid to that process, amounting to EUR 15 million to date. We recognise that more may be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that at the moment the peace agreement is holding in Monrovia, but less well outside. Part of that problem is that there is still a shortage of troops on the ground. There are only 1 500 out of a promised 3 500. Those troops are required as soon as possible.</p>

On the one hand, it is where there are the best opportunities for a regional market to grow and develop, and some states have done well by African standards in making progress in recent years. On the other hand, there are states – of which Sierra Leone is one example, and Liberia is another – where not only is the state in crisis, but where every vestige of the rule of law threatens to disappear. We have to consider how we are going to respond in the face of this situation. We have to be clear in our own minds that Liberia started out with a congenital defect, as the descendants of black African returnees from America were in violent conflict with the indigenous inhabitants from the word go and the state has never been internally united.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there are also violent conflicts, organised criminality, powerful raw materials interests, and the danger, despite all current efforts and even though some period of time without war can be achieved, that the real problem, the establishment of a constitutional state that functions to some degree, will not actually be tackled. Important though troops are, they cannot do it on their own. What the country needs is the establishment of a state, the building of institutions, and the truth that a state does not come into being automatically is demonstrated in Somalia, where there has been no rule of law whatever for the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a characteristically European conception that well-ordered states must always and everywhere be in place, even though, in the aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War, it took us decades to re-establish a functioning state order. For a start, then, we should not take an arrogant approach to these matters; secondly, we need to apply a certain healthy realism. We must first put a stop to the violence and must alleviate the direst need; then, though, will begin a process, which will last decades, of re-establishing political institutions that work to at least some degree. That will not happen without massive help from us, but nor can it be successful unless the people want to help themselves. It cannot happen without support from the country’s neighbours, without regional cooperation, without the establishment of a regional community in West Africa. There are however two sides to this, as the state borders and ethnic boundaries do not coincide, resulting in the danger of aid to neighbourhoods being misused – as it was in the Congo – in order to strengthen the hand of related peoples in internal politics on the other side of the border and to upset the balance of nationalities.</p>
<p class="contents">A healthy combination of external help, help aimed at enabling people to help themselves, and regional cooperation offers the only chance for this region, racked by crises, to get back on its feet, at least in the medium term.</p>

<p class="contents">We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting. It is very important that ECOWAS fully deploys its peacekeeping troops to ensure that the peace agreement is respected on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The figure available to me as to how many troops have actually been deployed is 2127. ECOWAS is doing what it is expected to do. We hope that the presence of this force will permit a rapid resumption of humanitarian assistance and an end to the atrocities that, especially for women and children, have been terrible in Liberia.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been informed by ECOWAS that deployment should be completed by 9 September 2003. It has appointed a special representative for Liberia to oversee the conduct of the peacekeeping force and monitor the implementation of the peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">ECOWAS is not in a position to carry the financial burden of these operations alone, and following the proposal from the Commission the Council decided to make EUR 50 million available to support the peace process broadly defined in Liberia. This money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used: because of the situation we could not work there normally. For both the 7th and the 8th EDF, Liberia was more or less out of the circuit. Some things were possible, but only very little.</p>
<p class="contents">About EUR 8 million of the EUR 50 million are earmarked to support the ECOWAS peace-keeping operation and for the creation of the office of the special representative. The remaining funds should be used for a demobilisation and reintegration programme as well as for institution-building and the restoration of democratic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I was pleased to listen to Mr Posselt's contribution. These were wise words warning against the arrogant approach of taking it for granted that a rapid process of elections does it. This, unfortunately, is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be pragmatic and rediscover the practical value of the notion of governance. First stability or peace, then governance, then democratisation and then democracy itself. We have to be pragmatic and not allow ourselves to surrender to the temptation of prescribing those nice things that we take for granted here in our environment. We have to show confidence and be a more realistic partner. Liberia has been going through the most terrible, traumatic times.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the UN Security Council decision to establish a stabilisation force for Liberia to take over responsibility from ECOWAS as from 1 October 2003. Also, the contributions from Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for the peacekeeping force in Liberia are very welcome and we see a strong case for mobilising what I would now call 'partnership stamina'. We tried, over the years, to do something meaningful in Liberia, but with Mr Taylor around this was almost impossible. Regionally, it is extremely important that the opportunity now at hand is not missed.</p>

If the new Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, is really serious about his roadmap to democracy, he will immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues and give them an important role in this process. He presented this roadmap a few days ago behind closed doors, without the presence of the media or foreign diplomats. The plan is supposedly to set up a convention for a new constitution, which should lead to fair and free elections. As no information was given as to the how and when of this plan, the only conclusion I can draw is that the military regime is trying to sidetrack the West and is hoping to break out of its isolation. As it must not, of course, be allowed to succeed in this, I support the Council's decision to tighten the sanctions. Any remaining business contacts should be completely severed. The Commission and the Council, in cooperation with the United Nations, should continue to appeal for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues. She has been held illegally for more than three months, during which time she has gone on hunger strike. The international community must make the Burmese authorities responsible for her well-being and the Red Cross must gain access to her. Pressure from the neighbouring countries in the ASEAN – China, India and Japan – must be stepped up. Fortunately, the United States has also been very forthright in its opinion about the current situation and has expressly pledged its support to Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma is still the pariah of the international community. The military junta sees the enforcement of its own power as more important than the suffering of the Burmese people. The generals' roadmap to democracy has so far only led to prison. This is not only about the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also about the liberation of the Burmese people as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the first occasion I carried a letter from President Klaus Hänsch informing Aung San Suu Kyi of the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to her. Khin Nyunt, the current Prime Minister, played a central role in ensuring I did not have the opportunity to deliver that letter in person.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second occasion I was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely. On that occasion my colleagues and I were able to obtain her clear support for sanctions against the military regime in Burma. I hope the Council and the Commission recognise that is the view of the National League for Democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">30 August marked three months of detention at the end of 13 years of open prison for Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy. The State Peace and Development Council – the former SLORC – has harassed the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time she was visited was in July. On 31 August the United States reported she was on hunger strike. The regime denies that. If that is the case, the absolute minimum the authorities can do is to enable the international community to reassure itself of her wellbeing.</p>
<p class="contents">As for free and fair elections, the problem in Burma is not free and fair elections – those took place 13 years ago – but that the military regime is not prepared to accept the will of the Burmese people.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that ASEAN started to get involved in this process at its ministerial meeting in June. We welcome the pressure they put on Burma and note that the current military regime has refused to allow them to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">We demand her immediate release and that of all political prisoners, which would be a major step towards the restoration of democracy. We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness, in collaboration with the United States, to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma. In the meantime, we ask the Council to introduce tough further measures targeted against the regime, its members and their interests. They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power. We call on the Council and Member States to ask the United Nations Security Council to urgently address the situation in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN emissaries and the representatives of the Red Cross have not been able to visit her regularly. Last July a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross was probably the last contact that Aung San Suu Kyi had with the outside world. No one has seen her since.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the same way that the dictator denied secretly holding the young woman, the Burmese authorities are denying her hunger strike, made public on 31 August by the US State Department. The imprisonment and arrest of militants of the National League for Democracy in May quite rightly gave rise to much feeling in the world. The US took the opportunity to reinforce their economic sanctions on the Rangoon regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the – no doubt demagogic – use of this announcement by the US cannot, however, hide the severity of the regime nor its hypocrisy in promising an official roadmap destined to restore democracy. This programme, which includes, and I quote, ‘free and fair elections and a new Constitution’, still does not fix a timetable and remains silent on the release of the leader of the opposition. It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people, and this is a bad omen. The results of the 1990 elections which, let us remember, were a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, were not recognised by the armed forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association of South-East Asian Nations now threatens to exclude Burma from its members. It had hoped for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi before its next summit in Bali in October. As for the European Union, it should do everything possible to compel the military junta to free the Nobel Prize winner. In collaboration with the United Nations, the Council and the Commission should now show their determination, through strict sanctions, to do something practical in the process of democratisation in Burma. Political pressure should increase. Under the rule of one of the fiercest dictators, in the hands of a head of government who has held the duties of head of services of the military information for forty years, the Burmese people need all our solidarity. The worry such as that for the lady of Rangoon is a genuine one. Let us listen to the opposition, which has just declared that this hunger strike is a declaration that the Burmese generals are slowly but surely poisoning her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is absolutely unequivocal in its demand: the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope this message is now being heard by the Burmese regime. Aung San Suu Kyi is a symbol of resistance to tyranny and personifies the hopes of the people of Burma for freedom. She has spent eight of the last thirteen years under some form of detention or restriction and on 30 May 2003 she was seized again and has been held virtually incommunicado, to all intents kidnapped by the regime in a military barracks in the Ye Mon district of Rangoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Four days ago it was reported that she was on hunger strike and that she was in a serious condition. The International Committee of the Red Cross must be given immediate access to her in order to assist in the provision of emergency assistance. Given the policy of the ICRC not to reveal the detention conditions of those that it visits, Aung San Suu Kyi should also be seen by Italian Ambassador Miniero, on behalf of the European Union, or by Her Majesty's Ambassador to Burma, Vicky Bowman.</p>
<p class="contents">These should be just the preliminaries to her release and to the release of scores of other National League for Democracy members and organisers, elected Members of Parliament, senior Party officials and students detained following the violent attack on opposition elements on 30 May 2003. Each member of the State Peace and Development Council that runs Burma must be held personally responsible for the health, safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">They must be put on notice that action will be taken against them. General Khin Nyunt, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, has talked about a roadmap to democracy. Let him show that he is serious, lift the barrier on that road, respond to our calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and recognise the results of the 1990 elections which gave a landslide victory to the National League for Democracy. To encourage him, much more needs to be done to increase the pressure on his military dictatorship in Burma. Action should now be taken to strengthen the EU sanctions with moves to deny Burmese dictatorship the hard currency it uses to fund its repression.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe, quiet diplomacy does not work. Neighbouring ASEAN countries need to do more to bring about change in Burma. I call on the Council presidency and the Commission to take urgent action, to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, to bring about her immediate release and, in case the SPDC does not respond in a positive way, to draw up new measures that can quickly be taken against the Burmese regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of Burma, not very much. In June, we called for the speedy introduction of democracy and for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in what was at the time a secret location. She has, since 1988, been campaigning for more democracy, and was awarded our Sakharov Prize in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. It was partly through our pressure that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were able to visit her.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, no prospect of democracy being introduced with any sort of urgency. Although the new Burmese Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, published, on 30 August, a roadmap for free elections by secret ballot, no firm date has been set for them. My fellow Members are right not to set too much store by promises of democracy and such things as the summoning of a constitutional convention, for it is the armed forces who take decisions on all important matters, and the convention will have no influence on them whatever. Aung San Suu Kyi has been on hunger strike since 31 August in order to make a forceful protest against her detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, too, have done with half measures! The EU’s imposition of a visa ban and its freezing of the overseas assets of Burmese associates of the regime are nothing like enough. As a community of values, one that exalts the maintenance of democracy and human rights as its supreme principle, the EU must take a hard line with the junta in Rangoon. Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters must be released from detention at last. The results of the free elections in 1990 must be accepted, power must be handed over to the forces of democracy, and the roadmap must be implemented, but under international supervision. Commissioner Nielson, I urge you to press for tougher action to be taken and for further sanctions to be imposed. These should, I believe, include an embargo on goods imported from Burma and a boycott of tourism in that country. That, perhaps, will be the sort of language they will understand.</p>

<p class="contents">The SPCD's announcement to restart the National Convention that would lead to free and fair elections has to be taken with caution. In the 15 years the regime has ruled Burma there has not been a single democratic reform. In fact the human rights situation in Burma has become worse.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be a very clear message from the European Union that relentless pressure will be applied to the Burmese regime. Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and the other political prisoners must be released immediately. We should be prepared to strengthen our sanctions to encourage the SPDC to relinquish its grip on power and fully respect the results of the last elections. Exports of oil, gas, gems, minerals and timber which provide the majority of the regime's income, could be targeted. as could the refusal of visas and freezing of assets. Dictators and their regimes and families should not be allowed to leave their country or to acquire any assets abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as increasing the sanctions against the regime, it is vital the EU should try to secure the cooperation and support of Asian countries, in particular Burma's neighbouring countries. International pressure is necessary to force the regime to respond positively.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi reported to be on hunger strike, the EU should intensify its actions to secure her release and the release of other detained NLD members and to support democratic change in Burma. We should use our liberty to promote theirs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed, and has been refused, permission to visit her.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that. I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison?

<p class="contents">A statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon dismisses this information as 'groundless'. Other sources indicate, however, that the pro-Democracy leader is indeed on hunger strike. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that an independent body be given the opportunity to immediately visit Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is completely unacceptable. The regime’s argument that her detention was 'temporary' and 'protective' lacks all credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly demanded immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy and will continue to do so. The junta has to understand that her release will serve the interests of the regime, as it has declared its desire to move on in the process of national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has declared itself ready to actively support the process of national reconciliation in Burma/Myanmar. But as long as Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists of the National League for Democracy remain in prison, the basic preconditions for this process do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Any serious plan to bring about political change in Burma will need to incorporate a timeframe which gives a clear perspective for the process of national reconciliation. We fully agree with the honourable Members of Parliament that this process will also need the support of the international community. In this context we would like to reiterate our support for the efforts undertaken by UN Special Envoy Ambassador Razali.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time for the regime in Rangoon to act. If the new government under Prime Minister Khin Nyunt truly has intentions to work towards democracy and political reform, the first step would be to release Aung San Suu Kyi now and to immediately start a dialogue between the various parties concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the lack of definitive conclusions on the effects of such a process, what is needed first of all is a vote of confidence in the ability of the beneficiary states to act responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a move could enable these countries, if they see fit, to promote competition between suppliers of goods or services, thereby potentially reducing additional costs and the risks of corruption inherent in tied aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite adopting this principled stance, I would recommend caution, a gradual approach and the phasing in of the measure, because to do otherwise could lead to some States refusing to grant aid to developing countries, despite having the desire to do so, on the grounds that they cannot simply donate funds without receiving any form of compensation in return.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose that, given the ambiguous nature of some political powers and public administrations, the corruption that we are attempting to prevent through the proposed untying could be perpetrated in other ways. I would, therefore, recommend that that the Union monitors and keeps a close eye on the way in which this measure is implemented, in order effectively to assess the good that it does and to deter any potential distortion of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>On 2 July, speaking on behalf of the Italian Presidency, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi admitted in the European Parliament that the members of the Euro zone no longer had any financial and monetary means of combating recessions and that instead there was a need for ‘European measures’, an active European financial policy and measures by the European Investment Bank.

<p>What is the Council’s view of the proposal made in June/July by France’s Defence Minister, Michèle Alliot-Marie, partly with the support of her German counterpart Peter Struck, that purchases of armaments should be regarded not as expenditure but as investment, so that they would have no bearing on the balanced-budget requirement, and the suggestion by Italy’s Minister for European Affairs, Rocco Buttiglione, that research funding should be treated in the same way?

<p>(IT) The Stability and Growth Pact provides for assessment of Member States' general government budgetary positions, as set out in the national accounts. Detailed provisions for the establishment of the national accounts, including the concept of 'general government', are laid down in Council Regulation No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European System of National and Regional Accounts in the Community (commonly referred to as ESA 95).</p>
<p>The established figures for 'general government' budgetary positions include both defence and research expenditure, so these are taken into account when considering national budgetary positions in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Council has not discussed any proposal to alter ESA 95 definitions for the purposes of surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>In respect of the content of public expenditure programmes, the Council has always emphasised the importance of the quality of public expenditure when assessing Member States' annual Stability and Convergence Programmes in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. This was reflected in the ECOFIN Council's report to the Spring 2003 European Council on 'Strengthening the co-ordination of budgetary policies', which was endorsed by the European Council. This was the most recent discussion in ECOFIN of the budgetary coordination framework and concluded unequivocally that 'there is no need to change either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact, nor to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules'. The report did, however, note that 'greater attention should be paid, within the overall constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, to the quality of public finances with a view to raising the growth potential of the EU economies in conformity with the Lisbon agenda'. Thus the quality of public finances and their contribution to raising potential growth will be assessed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact without any change to the parameters of the Pact itself.</p>
<p>The 'European measures' which might be envisaged to promote growth are presented both by the Italian Presidency in its 'European Action for Growth' and by the Commission in its 'Initiative for Growth'.</p>
<p>How the EIB might contribute is described in the EIB's Memorandum to the ECOFIN Council: 'The EIB's role in promoting long-term growth through investment in TENs and major R&amp;D projects'. All three of these documents were discussed by the ECOFIN Council on 15 July, at which it adopted Conclusions giving a mandate to the Economic and Financial Committee for further work. Those Conclusions clearly note that further discussion of the issue is expected at the ECOFIN Council and the European Council in October, then at the ECOFIN Council in November and the European Council in December. Other Council formations will pursue work on the particular aspects of concern to them in order to inform discussions at the European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0453"></a>

<p>According to the information available at the time of writing, the Spanish citizen Ana Isabel Sánchez Torralba was murdered yesterday in Equatorial Guinea by means of gunshots fired by local military personnel at the coach in which she was travelling through the mainland part of the country. She had travelled to Guinea (together with various companions) in order to work for Misioneras Escolapias. This is a brutal act which has cost a young Spaniard her life and which was committed by people who, in a premeditated, unjustifiable and criminal fashion, opened fire on a civilian vehicle which had just passed a military checkpoint. Such a deed illustrates the behaviour of representatives of the forces of order who are accustomed to attacking and mistreating members of the general public. What information is the Council to seek?

The Council is of the opinion that the problem of violence and crimes should be addressed in general terms and not only in relation to EU citizens.</p>
<p>The EU is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the internal political situation in Equatorial Guinea with regard to the human rights record and the democratisation process. Following last year's elections (December 2002) the EU expressed its concern over the political development in the country and in particular on the increased human rights violations. The EU urged the government and the political opposition to hold an all-inclusive political dialogue on the process towards democratisation and on establishing guarantees for the respect of human rights. It will continue to do so and in any case to purchase any action within its contracts with the relevant authorities to prevent and clear up dramatic situation as the one referred to by the Honourable Parliamentarian in his question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0455"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council would like to remind the Honourable Member that the decision taken by the Council on 2 May 2002 to include the 'Mujahedin-e-Khalq' in the EU list of persons and groups involved in terrorist acts was based on a detailed and in-depth examination of available information fully complying with the criteria laid down in Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001. These criteria were set out to ensure that all cases comply with the fundamental principles and procedures of the rule of law and respect human rights.</p>
<p>The Council would like to clarify once again that the inclusion in the list of a person or group is subject to a prior decision taken by a competent authority. The competent authorities in question are those addressed in Article 1(4) of the above mentioned Common Position.</p>
<p>In connection with the raid undertaken on 17 June 2003 by the French authorities against the MKO, the Council is not aware of any decision by the French judiciary stating whether or not the MKO is a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>As regards the Argentine judiciary's decision to issue a series of international arrest warrants against officials of the Iranian regime, the Council has not taken a position on this matter.</p>
<p>The EU is currently negotiating with the Iranian authorities a Trade and Co-operation agreement and, in parallel, an agreement on political dialogue and co-operation on counter-terrorism. The Council has underlined that all these agreements form an indissociable whole as regards their entry into force, application and denunciation.</p>
<p>The EU also takes advantage of all political dialogue meetings with Iran to press for further progress in democratic reforms. In this regard, a specific dialogue on Human Rights has been set up with Iran; two meetings have already taken place and a third one is scheduled for September.</p>
<p>The EU has always made clear in its dialogue with all third countries that fighting terrorism must be done in full respect of human rights and the rule of law, and that it must by no means serve as a pretext to enforce or maintain restrictions on fundamental freedoms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The honourable Member is no doubt aware of the long-term nature of developing the potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the interests of sustainability. It should be noted that the Community has funded research on hydrogen and fuel cells since the 1970s and this funding has been substantially increased within the current sixth framework programme as compared to its predecessor. Given the size of the task of developing the hydrogen economy, international co-operation is considered to be necessary, indeed vital, to achieving progress. The recent agreement with the US should be seen against this background; it results in fact, from an amendment to an existing implementing agreement between the Commission and the US Department of Energy (DOE)<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will also be aware that implementation of the Science and Technology agreement concluded between The European Community and the Government of the United States of America in 1998 falls under the responsibility of the Commission; the Council has no direct involvement in its implementation.</p>
<p>The Council, therefore, has no specific tasks in formulating the timetable and action plan relating to the 'International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy', which is a US initiative, and which is being developed during the course of 2003. It will, of course, as part of the long-term policy development in energy and research matters follow progress very closely.</p>
<p>For more detailed information regarding the timetable and action plan relating to the 'International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy', the honourable Member is advised to take up these questions with the competent authorities.</p>
<p>There are, for the moment, various means for fostering public-private collaboration on research and development, the most obvious one being the implementation of the sixth framework programme within the context of the European Research Area. Various recent initiatives for increasing investment in R&amp;D to reach the 3% GDP objective have underlined the importance of this collaboration<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the content of which could be better detailed by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

As the whole process will last about one year, the Commission’s opinion is expected to be ready by spring 2004.</p>
<p>The Italian Presidency has indicated to the Commission the need for a careful, speedy, overarching and in depth study of the Croatian situation and will continue to support the Croatian government in its endeavours in the reform process the Country has embarked in.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0490"></a>

<p>According to journalists arrested in Laos while preparing a report on the Hmong in the province of Xieng Khouang, 5 or 6 groups of Lao Hmong are living there in desperate conditions. These groups, who are forced to live on a diet of roots, ‘have been subjected to a policy of brutal repression by the Vientiane authorities for decades. With no other weapons but old AK-47s and patched up M16s, and with no ammunition, ‘they aspire to peace and a normal life’. According to the journalists, no solution will be found without mediation by ‘a third party’, since the Lao Hmong have no confidence in the Laotian authorities.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of the tragic situation of the Hmong people in Laos? What initiatives does it intend to take to end the fierce repression they have suffered for almost 40 years? Would the Council be willing to act as a mediator between the Hmong groups and the Vientiane government with a view to achieving a rapid and fair solution to the problem, and is it prepared to launch an exceptional operation to offer the 2 000 or so Hmong refuge on EU territory?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member is aware, there is an increasing number of products marketed in the Community and presented as supplementing the intake of nutrients from the normal diet.</p>
<p>The preamble to Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to food supplements notes that those products were regulated in Member States by differing national rules that may impede their free movement, create unequal conditions of competition, and thus have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market. It was therefore necessary to adopt Community rules on those products marketed as foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The other important objective of this Directive was to ensure the products on the market are subject to maximum safe levels, in order to avoid excessive intakes which may result in adverse effects, and bear adequate and appropriate labelling, in order to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers and facilitate their choice.</p>
<p>As a first stage, this Directive lays down specific rules for a certain number of nutrients used as ingredients of food supplements. Specific rules concerning other nutrients or substances with a nutritional or physiological effect used as ingredients of food supplements will be studied at a later stage, provided that adequate and appropriate scientific data about them become available. Until such specific Community rules are adopted, national rules concerning them will remain applicable.</p>
<p>The maximum amounts of nutrients listed in the annexes to the Directive and present in food supplements per daily portion of consumption as recommended by the manufacturer have not yet been set, taking notably into account the upper safe levels of nutrients established by scientific risk assessment and the intake of nutrients from other dietary sources. Thus, a revision at this stage seems premature.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the basis of the above, will the Council say whether it intends to take initiatives to produce a more effective cohesion policy for island regions of the Union? Does it intend to propose that the Commission take measures to support the most disadvantaged island regions of the EU on the basis of the latest comparative and qualitative data at its disposal?

<p>(IT) The Council reminds the honourable Member that, in order to promote the harmonious development of the Community as a whole, the Community is developing and pursuing its measures, pursuant to Article 158 of the EC Treaty, seeking, in particular, to close the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and to reduce the amount by which the less favoured and island regions, including rural areas, are lagging behind.</p>
<p>For the regions referred to in Article 299(2), the Treaty also considers island status as one of the factors whose effects can combine, in the long-term, to stunt development severely.</p>
<p>With regard to the report drawn up at the initiative of the Commission, which contains an analysis of the island and outermost regions of the European Union, the document, which states that the 286 island regions are spread over 11 Member States of the European Union, also notes that over 75% of the islands identified are concentrated within the territory of five Member States and that, with some exceptions, their economic and social situation is, in general, worse than that of the country to which they belong and, in any case, differs substantially from island to island.</p>
<p>The Council points out that a set of instruments already exists at European Union level which, directly or indirectly, provide a response or contribution to the situation of island regions.</p>
<p>We would mention, by way of example, the funding granted to islands entitled to it under the Cohesion Fund, the more flexible competition rules applying to island regions and the Union programmes which, although not key programmes for island regions as such, have, nonetheless, proved to be positive for emerging sectors such as the promotion of renewable energy, programmes relating to the information society, telemedicine projects, the LIFE programme and programmes in the field of employment – giving a greater local dimension.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is too early for the Council to be able to provide any information on the holding of the final negotiations to be launched on the Structural Funds after 2006.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Italian Presidency has stipulated in its programme that the cohesion policies must remain a fundamental pillar of Community integration. The reform of the solidarity policies and the drawing up of the new programme for the enlarged Union for the period 2007-2013 will be based on the practical information the Commission provides in its third report.</p>
<p>However, the Council would remind the honourable Member that any measure or initiative similar to that described in his speech adopted before the general revision of the current framework is subject to the submission of a Commission proposal. The Council has not received any proposal to that effect.</p>
<p>As regards the Intergovernmental Conference, work will be organised and carried out in accordance with the relevant rules laid down in the Treaty. The Council will take note of the results in due time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has equally taken note of and discussed at preparatory levels the statement, which Commissioner Pascal Lamy delivered before the European Parliament on 18 June 2003 on the future of the textile and clothing sector in view of the WTO negotiations. The year 2005 is a double target date for the textile and clothing sector: by then, the Doha Round has to be concluded and by then as well, all quantitative restrictions or quotas will have to be lifted. So, 31 December 2004 marks the end of the ongoing WTO general trade negotiations and the end of four decades of managed trade in the textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p>In general, concerning the textile and clothing sector, our common commercial policy has as a matter of fact always been based on the request of reciprocity during negotiations with third parties, as outlined in the general mandate adopted by Council on 9 November 2000 and as most recently achieved in the new textiles and clothing trade agreement with Vietnam, adopted by Council on 2 June 2003.</p>
<p>It must be said however that the negotiations in the Doha Round are based on the corresponding Ministerial Declaration which asks for the negotiations to 'take fully into account the special needs and interests of developing and least-developed country participants, including through less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments'. The WTO mandate therefore departs somewhat from the principle of complete reciprocity, which has been the constant guideline for the EC so far.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Council can assure the honourable Member that it shares the positions expressed by the European Parliament and by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0497"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council Conclusions of 10 December 2002 (doc. 15138/02), mentioned inter alia the need to 'consider the possibility of a limited strategy or guidelines for concrete EU action, e.g. in the field of (…) children and armed conflict, as an alternative to a comprehensive EU strategy'. The Council Working Party on Human Rights is to consider such a limited strategy or guidelines during the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Council seeks to reinforce international action in all appropriate fora to promote the rights and the protection of children, to ensure the rehabilitation of children affected by armed conflict and against recruiting and using children in armed conflict. To this end, the EU supports in particular the work of the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, and recognizes the importance of the work carried out by the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNIFEM, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>The EU welcomed the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in February 2002. This year, like in previous years, the EU successfully tabled a resolution (2003/86) on the rights of the child at the UN Commission on Human Rights, which calls for the protection of children affected by armed conflict (paragraphs 38-43).</p>
<p>The EU also welcomed the adoption of UNSC resolution 1460 (2003) of 30 January 2003 and the undertaking by the Security Council to give special attention to the protection, welfare and rights of children in armed conflict when taking action aimed at maintaining peace and security, including provisions for the protection of children in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, as well as the inclusion of child protection advisers in these operations. In this context, the Council adopted conclusions on the protection of civilians in EU-led operations at its meeting on 21 July 2003. The Council, in particular through work by the Committee on Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management, will further develop appropriate instruments to ensure effective implementation of those conclusions in EU-led Crisis Management Operation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0501"></a>

<p>(EN) Before replying to the question of the honourable Member in more detail, the Commission would like to ask attention for the fact that it supports the incomes of the sheep farmer through a Common Market Organisation. There is no specific scheme at Community level to support the wool sector, and the Commission does not have plans to set up such a scheme in the foreseeable future. However, there are certain possibilities for support in this sector.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to mention the rural development programmes, and more specifically the LEADER+ initiative, which have financed some projects concerning wool. The structural funds have also supported regional development projects of which the wool sector has been a beneficiary.</p>
<p>Concerning young farmers, with the common agriculture policy (CAP) reform agreed by the Council of Agriculture in June 2003, three new provisions in the Rural Development Regulation 1257/99 are to be introduced, which benefit young farmers:</p>
<p>Firstly, a new recital that establishes that young farmers should be considered a priority;</p>
<p>Secondly, an increase by 5 percentage points in maximum public support for investments in agricultural holdings. This means actually an increase from 45% to 50% in the non-less favoured areas and from 55% to 60% in less favoured areas, and</p>
<p>Thirdly, a higher support for the setting-up of young farmers, who are using farm advisory services linked to the setting-up, in this case the maximum premium increases from € 25 000 to € 30 000.</p>
<p>Once the legal texts of the CAP reform are adopted, Member States can make use of these new possibilities and adapt their rural development programmes. If there are young farmers who see opportunities in the wool sector and intend to set up a business and invest in it, these new provisions can of course benefit them. However, it is the young farmer as a market player who has to take these decisions based on the assessment of the business opportunities he/she sees.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0464"></a>

<p>(EN) As pointed out by the honourable Member, seaweed represents a valuable asset that can contribute to the socio-economic development of coastal regions either through the harvesting of seaweed growing naturally or through active farming thereof. The former offers few possibilities for development in the Union as wild seaweed is already harvested to its full potential in most Member States. Actually, these Member States have developed complex legislation to make the best of the harvesting of wild seaweed in their near shore areas and to avoid the over exploitation of these sessile marine living resources.</p>
<p>As for seaweed farming, marginal quantities of seaweed are already farmed in the Union and potential for future expansion may exist in a number of Member States, as indicated in the recent Communication from the Commission to the Council and the Parliament 'A Strategy for the Sustainable Development of Aquaculture'<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In this strategic document, the Commission recommends that aquaculture activities should be diversified and that more efforts should be dedicated to research on new species, especially species, such as seaweed, that are able to utilise primary production efficiently. In this respect, Community support has already been provided to at least two research projects aiming at the improvement of seaweed cultivation techniques, one for Laminaria digitata (project AIR3-CT94-2235), the other for the edible red seaweed Palmaria palmata (project FAIR-CT97-3828).</p>
<p>Member States wishing to develop seaweed farming may use European structural funds for this purpose. They may in particular dedicate a significant share of the funds allocated to them through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) to the development of aquaculture and/or to processing or marketing of its products. They may also follow the recommendation from the Commission to allocate greater public support to aquaculture diversification which could provide opportunities for future seaweed farming development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken careful note of the question raised by the honourable Member on the classification of rural areas.</p>
<p>There is no single commonly agreed and internationally recognised definition of rural areas, given their great diversity. The Commission has itself no current plans to propose new objective criteria for the definition of a typology of rural areas.</p>
<p>Preparation of any such typology could only be considered for the preparation of rural development policy post 2006. However, even with this longer term perspective, the Commission is not convinced that a common typology defined at Community level is necessary for the implementation of Community rural development policy, nor that a single common typology could take account of the wide diversity of rural situations which will exist in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p>Under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 it is currently the responsibility of Member States when preparing their rural development programmes to define what they consider to be rural areas, within their specific national and/or regional contexts.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the current flexible framework under which Community rural development policy is implemented, which gives a high degree of subsidiarity to Member States, already provides sufficient scope for those Member States or regions who so wish to target the measures within their programmes on the specific needs of rural areas.</p>
<p>Under the 'Less-favoured area measure and areas with environmental restrictions', specified in Chapter V of Council Regulation 1257/1999 there are well-established Community criteria which result:</p>
<p>a)firstly in a distinction between Less favoured rural areas and other rural areas</p>
<p>b)and in a Community typology of handicaps for Less favoured areas:</p>
<p>Natural handicaps (mountain areas; areas north of the 62nd Parallel treated as mountain areas; areas with specific natural handicaps; areas with environmental restrictions resulting from Community law);</p>
<p>Less favoured areas with socio-economic handicaps in danger of abandonment of land-use.</p>
<p>As indicated in the Commission's replies to the European Community Court of Auditors Special Report n° 4/2003 concerning the support for Less favoured areas the evaluation of the results of the current programmes will provide information on the need for a review of the Less favoured areas classification criteria and on the basis of this information the Commission will consider whether the present system should be changed for the period after 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0508"></a>

<p>The recently adopted legislation amending Regulation (EC) 609/2001<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Regulation (EC) 412/97<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> governing the creation of producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector has not simplified the previous legislative picture: rather, it has complicated it, by offering Member States ample room for manoeuvre when determining the prerequisites for creating such organisations. The new rules state that, should the Member State concerned so wish, producer organisations may market fruit and vegetables not produced by their members. They also authorise participation in their capital by non-producers. These new provisions are liable to create distortions of competition, since they imply a renationalisation of the COM; in addition, they may signal the defeat of the efforts made in the sector to concentrate production.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain the underlying reasons for these major changes to the COM, and state whether it has made any forecasts of the likely impact of these measures on the market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Following the report which the Commission presented to the Council and to Parliament in January 2001 on the working of the common organisation of the markets (COM) in fruit and vegetables and in accordance with the conclusions of the Spanish Presidency following the examination of this report in the Council, there appeared to be an urgent need to simplify the regulations governing fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>This simplification was necessary in order to simplify the life of the market players and increase legal certainty for them, as well as for the Member States, especially if you think about the impending enlargement and the importance, to the future Member States, of an improved acquis.</p>
<p>The Commission started this process back in December 2002 by reviewing the implementing provisions for this COM. The work was therefore carried out within the framework of the management committee, even though the discussion was extended to the main representatives of the sector and numerous suggestions and comments were received by the Commission from national, regional and European professional organisations, from cooperatives and Producers Organisations (PO).</p>
<p>At the management committee meeting held at the beginning of July 2003, the majority of the delegations supported most of the new provisions for this simplification proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that this simplification will help the sector to achieve one of the objectives of the 1996 reform, namely to enable POs to further concentrate the supply of fruit and vegetables. With approximately 30% of production concentrated by the POs on the eve of the reform, the objective set was to achieve 60%. However, this index was still limited to 40% in 2001. According to the Commission, the changes made will make POs better able to respond to the challenges of a highly competitive market and better able to concentrate the supply further, both through transnational POs and associations of POs, which instruments have been strengthened, and through cooperation between different POs, which is widely encouraged by the new rules.</p>
<p>This simplification will also allow the Member States to take better account of the specific practical situations which characterise each of them and with regard to which greater subsidiarity was considered necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The situation in the Northern Caucasus keeps deteriorating, especially with regard to the protection of the 85 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ingushetia and the provision of humanitarian aid. The Commission is, in particular, extremely concerned at the current situation of IDPs, who are under growing pressure to return to Chechnya. The latest declarations made by Chechen, Ingush and Russian authorities, indicating a few weeks ago that there would be no tent camps left in Ingushetia by the end September, have only added to the diverse forms of pressure put on the IDPs to leave Ingushetia. Aid organisations, among which the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), continue to be forbidden from replacing tents in camps or constructing alternative shelter for IDPs who do not want to return to Chechnya as long as insecurity prevails. The 180 rooms in barracks built by Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and funded by ECHO still remain empty to date. These are clear factors which point to an increased vulnerability of IDPs present in Ingushetia and to a degradation in the level of protection they are entitled to. In addition, the security situation has deteriorated as well, with armed forces coming from Chechnya extending their mop-up operations to civilians displaced in spontaneous settlements.</p>
<p>In Chechnya proper, the situation keeps deteriorating and it is very likely that violence and insecurity will only increase as elections are approaching. Severe and widespread violations of human rights continue, in particular abductions of civilians at night, tortures and extra-judiciary executions. The humanitarian situation has not improved either so far and people, particularly in Grozny, keep depending largely on external humanitarian aid for their survival.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, access to Chechnya is still extremely difficult, if not impossible, for humanitarian staff and working there entails great risks for aid workers, as the example of Arjan Erkel, the Head of MSF who was abducted 13 months ago, sadly demonstrates. As the honourable Member knows, all demarches to the Russian authorities about Mr Erkel have led nowhere so far, and the Commission counts on your continued support to help it raise the issue whenever possible until his safe liberation is obtained.</p>
<p>As a result of this high insecurity, most aid agencies work through 'remote control' set-ups and rely to a great extent on the extraordinary work of the local staff.</p>
<p>ECHO will continue to support these organisations and maintain the same level of funding for the victims of the crisis in Chechnya: this year's budget is € 26 million. The Commission, through ECHO, remains the largest donor in the region and has already allocated more than € 93 million since the beginning of the second Chechnya conflict. The main sectors ECHO supports are food, non-food, health, water and sanitation, protection, education and shelter. A majority of ECHO's beneficiaries are women and children.</p>
<p>In order to be closer to these beneficiaries and to have more access to Chechnya, ECHO is still trying to open a sub-office in Nazran, Ingushetia. Unfortunately, this proves very difficult since Russian authorities have refused so far to give permission. The Commission hopes that the Russian authorities will eventually respond positively to its request and that it will reach an agreement with them on this issue.</p>
<p>In view of the deterioration of the situation and the many problems ECHO and its partner organisations face in the delivery of aid, the Commission has repeatedly raised the question with the Russian side on numerous occasions over a longer period and the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Cooperation has personally written twice to the President of Ingushetia to voice his concerns and ask for his support. He hopes this will help facilitating our continued action in favour of the many victims of this terrible crisis.</p>
<p>The situation in Abkhazia has not improved at all from a humanitarian point of view. It has even deteriorated in the last few years, with very little presence of humanitarian organisations. This is why, in view of the extent of the forgotten needs, ECHO has decided in 2002 to renew its support to the most vulnerable populations. ECHO had phased out, like most humanitarian donors, from Abkhazia in 2000, hoping that the situation would improve. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and the absence of a settlement to this frozen conflict has had negative consequences on the economic situation of the region.</p>
<p>ECHO funding for the victims of the Abkhazia conflict, in Abkhazia and in the rest of Western Georgia, amounted to € 1,3 million in 2002 and will amount to € 2,2 million in 2003. This will allow to fund soup kitchens and the distribution of dry food, as well as income and food-generation programmes and food-for-work activities. ECHO will continue to regularly monitor the situation and will have to be engaged as long as humanitarian needs remain.</p>
<p>ECHO is not present in Nagorno-Karabakh but continues to follow the situation and will be ready to intervene, should the situation deteriorate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0489"></a>

<p>EU bodies such as EAR invite NGOs to participate in particular projects with financial backing from the EU. Some NGOs regard the rules on payment procedures as impractical and obstructive, as EU payments are based inter alia on retrospective part-payments in return for submission of receipts. What this means in practice is that NGOs have to advance large sums, which they often lack the resources to do. Moreover, the final payment of the contractual amount is made only after the work has been completed and the costs incurred and approved by means of a special audit. Consequently it is the NGOs rather than the EU body that have to bear the economic risk. The payment procedure also causes major administrative difficulties for those NGOs whose work depends heavily on the use of volunteers.</p>
<p>Has the Commission assessed, or will it assess, whether these payments are equitable and effective vis-à-vis the parties selected by means of a tender procedure?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Payment of subsidies to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from the Union’s general budget comes within the framework of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget, especially Articles 79 to 82 and 117 to 119 (and Articles 97, 99, 104-105 and 180 to 183 of the implementing rules). These provisions require the Commission to ensure that proper use is made of Community funds, mainly by limiting the level of prefinancing and demanding audits and financial guarantees. Provision is made for simplified control procedures for NGOs who sign a framework partnership agreement with the Commission on the basis of article 163 of the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation (implementing procedure for humanitarian aid actions).</p>
<p>The flexibility provided for under the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation is used mainly by the Commission to speed up the procedures for making payments to NGOs.</p>
<p>Thus, the procedures for making payments relating to subsidies within the framework of external actions (including by the European Agency for Reconstruction) benefit NGOs. Prefinancing, which may be as much as 80% of the value of the contract (or of the budget for the first year of multiannual contracts) is paid within 45 days of signing of the contract. This prefinancing is much higher than the Commission average. For multiannual contracts, cumulative prefinancing may be as much as 90% of the value of the contract.</p>
<p>In addition, and in order to speed up payments, payments are made simply on presentation and approval of mid-term or final reports (including audit reports where the amount of the payment so warrants). The substantiating documentation is retained by the beneficiary in case the Commission conducts an ex-post audit.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it cannot make the payment procedures any more flexible without compromising its facility to ensure that actions subsidised are implemented correctly, in accordance with proper financial management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0502"></a>

<p>(EN) All Country Strategy Papers are subject to an intensive review and quality support process prior to approval. This review includes examination of the choice of focal and non-focal sectors selected and allows the Commission to monitor which countries have included health as a priority.</p>
<p>Concentration of aid in a limited number of focal sectors and national ownership are important principles in country strategy programming. Intervention sectors are chosen on the basis of complementarity with other donors and the comparative advantage of the Commission in the country concerned. As a result, while the Commission consistently promotes health as a development objective, health is not always chosen as a focal sector of Community aid.</p>
<p>Seventeen developing countries have identified health as a focal sector in Country Strategy Papers that were finalised by the end of 2002. In national indicative programmes, the level of allocations for health remains low, but Community funds are increasingly devoted to general budget support. One advantage is that, unlike traditional project aid, budget support provides additional funding for recurrent expenditure, which makes up the major part of the health budget. Budget support may also provide extra money for activities outside the health sector which benefit health, for example improving water supplies and sanitation. In African, Caribbean and Pacific countries 24.4% of 9<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund programmable resources amounting to over 1.73 billion € are allocated to general budget support. The Commission’s guidelines on health sector programming and monitoring of indicators aim at ensuring the links between poverty reduction budget support strategies and improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) are developed by national authorities in consultation with all key stakeholders. Where a country has a PRSP, the Commission’s policy is that the Country Strategy should be aligned to it. PRSPs provide a single, comprehensive and costed framework for social development priorities and should deliver increased resources for the social sectors. The Commission recently took part in a consultation to review analytical work on health in PRSPs carried out by the World Health Organisation. This demonstrated that the importance of health is generally well reflected in PRSPs, and they include recognised pro-poor health strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0507"></a>

<p>(EN) This reply is a clarification following to earlier questions debated on 10 April and 3 July 2003.</p>
<p>The basis for Community policy in the field of sexual and reproductive health is the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. In relation to HIV/AIDS, sections 8.28-8.35 emphasise providing information and the promotion of safe and responsible sexual behaviour - including voluntary abstinence and the use of condoms. The Commission would also emphasise the importance of providing information about voluntary counselling and testing for HIV (this is mentioned in ICPD+5).</p>
<p>The Commission position is, therefore, that there should be a comprehensive approach to education about sex and sexuality. Young people should be provided with information and encouraged to think and decide for themselves and act responsibly. Such education should also take into account a strong gender perspective. While abstinence supposes 'safe' behaviour with regard to the transmission of HIV it is necessary to be realistic: it is not always the choice or even an option for those sexually active, in particular for women. And for the Commission to rely on preaching or prescribing abstinence as the only option is simply not responsible. Practical information about protecting oneself, in particular concerning the use of condoms, is therefore vital.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say in percentage terms what the relative part of Community efforts are for delaying the age of first sex and reducing the number of sexual partners. Most Community assistance for population-related activities is un-earmarked support for improved health outcomes or general budget support, but even specific support in this area is not conditional on putting more effort into one or other means of preventing HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The Commission does not make any specific distinction or category for religious or faith based organisations, although such organisations are and will continue to be welcome to apply for Community support through regular calls for proposals.</p>
<p>To give a concrete example, applicants under the latest call for proposals under the thematic Budget Line B7-6311: 'Programme to combat poverty related diseases in the developing countries, fight against HIV/AIDS' needed to be non-profit making and belong to one of the following categories: non-governmental organisations, public-sector operators distinct from the State, local organisations, research or training institutions. The call's objective was to enhance the relevance and usefulness of programmes to fight HIV/AIDS by improving their impact on young people in general, and young women in particular, and by including the poor and populations at risk.</p>
<p>As a result of the evaluation process, six applicants were selected to receive Community support, including civil organisations such as Danchurch and World Vision Netherlands.</p>
<p>As for all other applicants following this call's guidelines, 'Information, education and communication directed towards changing behaviour will be a priority, bearing in mind that the context (social, health, economic and cultural) must make the desired developments possible'. Safe and responsible sexual behaviour may include delaying the age of first intercourse and reducing the number of sexual partners but it may also include other elements such as the use of condoms or other contraceptive supplies.</p>
<p>Information on the calls for proposals, the selection and eligibility criteria and the actions selected are available on the EuropeAid website. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0485"></a>

<p>Implementation of the 'Environment &amp; Health Strategy<a href="#defann_35_3" name="refann_35_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span></p>
<p>The pilot programme is being drawn up in three stages:</p>
<p>In October 2002 a meeting of the so-called 'Helcom Monas'<span class="sup"> 4</span> was held in Warnemünde. The nine Baltic countries were asked to designate experts on the environment, fish and human health and to give the Commission an overview of the different monitoring activities in the Baltic region.</p>
<p>On 5 May 2003 there was an 'Expert Meeting' in Brussels to discuss a number of issues with dioxin experts from the Baltic Region. These issues included an overview of monitoring activities in the different Baltic Countries, a fish monitoring strategy and the links between environment monitoring and health monitoring.</p>
<p>In September 2003 a 'Technical Working Group on integrated dioxin and PCB monitoring in the Baltic Region' will be established in the framework of the 'Environment and Health Strategy'. The first meeting of this Technical Working Group will be held during the Regional Conference in Poland on 6-7 October 2003. By the end of 2003 it will prepare a Baseline Report, including an overview of existing dioxin and PCB monitoring programmes in the Baltic countries, the problems and shortcomings of existing monitoring systems, and requirements for integrated environment and health dioxin and PCB monitoring. During a second phase, the Working Group will by the end of March 2004 establish options for action and recommendations for the Commission’s 'Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010' to be presented as the Community contribution to the Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Budapest in June 2004.</p>
<p>Back in 2001 the Commission proposed a strategy for reducing the presence of dioxins in feed and food, including fish and fishery products as part of the Community Strategy for Dioxins, Furans and Polychlorinated Biphenyls. This strategy, through its integrated approach for reducing the presence of dioxins in feed and food, was to result in a reduction of dioxins levels in fish for human consumption, both wild and farmed.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of suggestions that catching the fish in which dioxins are concentrated would be a way of cleaning these pollutants out of the Baltic environment. Although the Commission would need much more scientific information before it could fully assess the possible effectiveness of such a measure, the information available at present does not indicate that it would be appropriate as part of a general strategy for reducing dioxin levels in the environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the recent meeting of the parties to the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the adoption of the Mexican-led Berlin initiative was a great step forward for the welfare of cetaceans worldwide, in particular through the creation of a new conservation committee within the IWC. Given that many Member States are members of the IWC and in light of the EU's aim to protect and conserve the marine environment in an integrated manner, could the Commission provide a summary of all existing legislation to ensure the protection of whales and dolphins in EU waters and explain how these measures will be coordinated with international action?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) At Community level, all cetacean species are protected under the Habitats Directive,<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the main piece of European legislation aiming at protecting natural habitats and wild fauna. Member States have to take the requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection in order to ensure a favourable status of conservation of cetaceans. Deliberate killing and disturbance of cetaceans as well as the keeping, transporting, sale or exchange of cetaceans or any part of them is banned.</p>
<p>Concerning incidental catches, the Community has, on several occasions, addressed this problem. Community legislation already limits the size of drift nets and has introduced measures to prohibit their use from the start of 2002.<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The Commission has recently proposed to regulate this issue in a comprehensive manner, extending the ban on driftnets to the Baltic Sea, using acoustic alarms in certain fisheries and instituting a scheme of on-board observers with a view to monitor by-catch.<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>At international level, the Commission makes every effort to assure that a similar approach is adopted and applied. Thus, when the conservation of cetaceans is discussed within relevant International Conventions and Agreements to which the Community is a party, the position of the Commission is to seek the highest possible level of protection for these species, while respecting the internal procedures established in these international organisms.</p>
<p>Regarding international trade in products obtained from whaling activities, the Community applies the provisions adopted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora, CITES by means of internal regulations<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Furthermore, the Community goes beyond what CITES requires, in order to ensure consistency with the protection of cetaceans as provided for by the Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>And finally, the Commission welcomes the Berlin Initiative on Strengthening the Conservation Agenda of the International Whaling Commission, as decided in its last meeting, that took place this year. The Commission hopes that this new effort from the IWC will contribute to improved conservation of these species.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The scenario of a Union which already has 15 and will soon have 25 different tax systems raises the question of what consequences these different European tax systems have for the functioning of the internal market. Can these largely negative consequences for business and consumers be quantified? What steps can the Commission take to remedy the situation, particularly bearing in mind that the principle of unanimity applies in tax matters? EU initiatives in the area of taxation must ensure that tax systems contribute to the efficient operation of the internal market, so that the corresponding framework can be created within which to achieve the objective set in Lisbon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively looking into the question raised by the honourable Member. For instance, the company tax study prepared in 2001 shows that the need for companies to comply with up to fifteen - and soon twenty-five - different sets of corporate tax rules within the Union gives rise to numerous barriers to cross-border economic activity. These prevent us from achieving the full potential economic benefits of the Internal Market. Without action, the Community and its citizens therefore risk foregoing potential growth, employment and welfare. Progress in this field is also crucial in order to achieve the Lisbon goals.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to determine or quantify the precise effects that the co-existence of 15 and soon 25 differing tax systems have on the functioning of the Internal Market. The Commission is launching in September an extensive survey among businesses in the Union on tax-related compliance costs that it hopes will provide some more insight into the dimension of these problems.</p>
<p>Current economic research does not allow detailed quantification of the size of these welfare losses. They certainly exist and they are substantial but putting a firm figure on their size would be too speculative. This is why there was a need to launch various short-term and longer-term initiatives to address the problems.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposed initiatives will take various forms, ranging from 'soft law' and co-ordination to traditional proposals for Directives. As to the prospect of success of the traditional legislative measures, however, it is true that without changing the unanimity principle for decision taking in Union tax matters, it will be extremely difficult to advance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0445"></a>

<p>(EN) Community law provides for the protection of regional services in two ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Community rules on market access provide for Governments to be able to impose the so-called public service obligations. For routes where a public obligation has been imposed and which are domestic, the Community rules on slot allocation provide that member States may reserve slots at fully coordinated airports (article 9 § 1 (b) of the Regulation). For non-domestic routes, where a public service obligation has been imposed, there is no possibility to reserve slots.</p>
<p>Secondly, for routes, which do not benefit from a public service obligation but connect regional airports on the territory of a Member State with a fully coordinated airport, the rules on slot allocation (article 9 § 1 (a) and § 3 of the Regulation) give Member States the right to reserve slots only under certain conditions. Accordingly, slots for such routes could be reserved, only if</p>
<p>the slots concerned are being used on that route at the time of entry into force of this Regulation;</p>
<p>only one air carrier is operating on the route;</p>
<p>no other mode of transport can provide an adequate service;</p>
<p>the reservation of slots shall end when a second air carrier has established a domestic scheduled service on the route with the same number of frequencies as the first air carrier and operated it for at least a season;</p>
<p>Also, as stated in paragraph 3 of article 9 of that Regulation, the Member State concerned has to communicate to the Commission the list of routes fulfilling the conditions set out in article 9 § (a) and (b) and for which slots have been reserved. This shall first be done at the entry into force of the Regulation, that is 22 February 1993, 30 days after its publication in the Official Journal on 22 January 1993, as provided for in article 15 of the Regulation.</p>
<p>To this date the only Member State, which has applied article 9 §1(a) is France. Today, the following routes are operated in application of article 9 § 1 (a) of the Regulation from the airport of Paris-Orly: Annecy, Avignon, Chambéry, Lannion, Limoges and Metz; a total of 6.894 slots have been reserved at Paris-Orly for these routes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission points out that the sale or retention of emission rights, from a fiscal point of view, will not be determined – at least as regards tax on income, capital and capital gains (derived from the sale of the said rights) – in the same way in the different Member States, given that these taxes are not harmonised at European level. As regards indirect taxation, the sale of emission rights will be construed as a provision of services as defined in the Sixth VAT Directive</p>
<p><a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and will be subject to VAT in all the Member States.</p>
<p>As the Commission has already observed during the amendments to the proposal tabled by Parliament at first reading, the directive cannot create fiscal obligations for the Member States which go beyond its scope. On questions of taxation, the Member States continue to have competence although, as the Court of Justice has stressed on several occasions, the exercise of this competence cannot release them from the obligation to comply with Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, is aware of the material issues raised and of the fact that the lack of coordination between the Member States' tax systems still carries risks of distortion on the internal market (refer, for example, to the answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2002-0028_EN.html">P-0028/02</a><a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>In - partially - accepting another amendment to the draft directive proposed by Parliament, the Commission felt that all the aspects relating to taxation (including capital gains and losses on emission rights bought and sold) were sufficiently interesting to warrant being highlighted in the report on the application of the directive which the Member States are required to submit to the Commission each year. On the basis of these national reports, the Commission will publish a report which may, if necessary, highlight tax problems linked to the application of the directive and the proper working of the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The situation in Tibet, including the maintenance and preservation of that country's cultural, linguistic and religious identity, is one of the European Union's priorities in the framework of its overall policy vis-à-vis China.</p>
<p>The communication channels that already exist between Peking and the Union have enabled the latter to bring its concerns in this regard to the Chinese authorities' attention on a very regular basis, be it at sessions of the bilateral Human Rights dialogue or at the very highest political level, during summit meetings.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Union has repeatedly called for direct dialogue to be established between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, which it considers to be the only realistic way of one day finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet. It welcomes the recent re-establishing of contacts during the second visit of the Dalai Lama's envoys to China and would like to see these intensified.

<p>(FR) The Commission has long been of the opinion that the European Union must be developed not only for young people but also with the assistance of young people. That is why it has run action programmes such as Socrates, Leonardo and Youth which are aimed at young people and which enable them to take part in activities at European level in the fields of education, training and youth work. The programmes are already open to young people from the applicant countries in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in European agreements, in the additional protocols thereto and in the decisions taken by the respective Association Councils. From 2004 the programmes will also be open to young people from Turkey.</p>
<p>When in November 2001 the Commission published its White Paper entitled 'A new impetus for European youth', it did so after having conducted a huge consultation exercise involving young people and youth organisations in both the Member States and the applicant countries. In its White Paper the Commission proposed establishing a new youth-cooperation framework based on an open coordination method in which 'applicant countries are associated as far as possible'. This proposal was adopted by the Council in its 27 June 2002 resolution on a cooperation framework for young people (OJ C 168, 13.7.2002).</p>
<p>In that resolution the Commission was instructed to send out questionnaires to the Member States and, on that basis, to propose common objectives for the four priorities identified in the White Paper and adopted by the Council in the resolution. The initial questionnaires sent out were concerned with the topics of participation and information provision. In its analysis of the replies received the Commission took into account the situation and the expectations of the applicant countries to which the questionnaires had also been sent out. The common objectives are currently on the Council table. In addition, many applicant countries consulted their young people and youth organisations before sending in their replies to the Commission. This consultation exercise (which follows on from the one carried out in connection with the White Paper) is an innovative tool preparing the way for enlargement, since it has enabled young people from the applicant countries themselves to become involved in the process of devising a youth policy. In order to increase young people's involvement in the political process the Commission is planning to issue in 2004 a call for proposals for pilot schemes which will encourage active citizenship on the part of young people. That call will be open to youth organisations in the new Member States.</p>
<p>The existing Youth programme will terminate at the end of 2006, for which reason the Commission has conducted a huge consultation exercise with a view to drawing up the next programme covering the 2007-2012 period. It intends to submit at the beginning of 2004 a proposal relating to young people and also to education and vocational training. The proposal will take full account of the needs of young people in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of young people within the employment market and within society as a whole is a major consideration in EU employment strategy and in EU social-inclusion strategy. The applicant countries are working in close cooperation with the Commission in order to prepare themselves for the implementation of those strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0461"></a>

<p>(EN) The main vehicle for multilateral educational exchanges between the Union and the United States (which have also a cultural and economic dimension) is the cooperation programme in the field of higher education and vocational training established by the agreement between the Community and the United States concluded in 1995. This programme was renewed for a further five-year period (2001-2005) concluded in 2001<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The programme aims primarily at promoting understanding between the peoples of the Community and the United States and improving the quality of their human resource development.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives the Community and the United States jointly support - within the constraints of a very limited budget - innovative, multilateral, student-centred projects with the potential to stimulate substantive and long-lasting structural transatlantic co-operation in higher education and vocational education and training. It may also support international education projects that give rise to new forms of cooperation between the United States and the Community.</p>
<p>Both the Community and the United States are committed to continuing and reinforcing cooperation in education and training within the present programme and beyond. The participation of the new Member States in the cooperation programmes with the United States as from 1 May 2004 depends on the relevant budget for 2004, which has not been fixed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>China has been a member of the WTO since 11 December 2001.

<p>(EN) The Commission is in close contact with the Community industry of ceramic tiles, in particular concerning the development of imports of ceramic tiles at low prices from the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>In relation to the steps that the Commission could take in order to provide relief against injurious and/or unfair imports from China, such steps can only be taken within the framework of the existing trade defence instruments, i.e. the anti-dumping, the anti-subsidy and the safeguard regulations (erga omnes safeguard regulation or the product specific safeguard mechanism against Chinese imports provided in Council Regulation (EC) No 427/2003 which implements China's Protocol of Accession to the World Trade Organisation).</p>
<p>The application of measures under any of the above-mentioned instruments is subject to international and Community rules. Thus, the initiation of any investigation must be based on prima facie evidence that imports of products of Chinese origin are causing material or serious injury to a Community industry. This analysis is based on the negative development of a certain number of factors, such as market shares, financial performance and employment. The anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruments furthermore require prima facie evidence of dumping (price discrimination or selling under costs of production) or of the provision of State aid to the exporters. If such prima facie evidence is presented to the Commission, the Commission is prepared to initiate an investigation in order to determine whether the conditions for the imposition of measures are met.</p>
<p>So far, the Commission has not received any official request for the initiation of an investigation regarding imports of ceramic tiles from China under any of the above-mentioned trade defence instruments. Needless to say, the Commission is always ready to provide assistance to the Community ceramic industry and Member States for the examination of the merits of a potential complaint under existing trade defence instruments, in particular when small and medium sized are involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Article 6 of the Habitats Directive requires Member States also to assess plans (and projects) in relation to their impact on Natura 2000 sites. The subject of these regulations are plans and programmes of the Member States including those in the transport sector: for these a strategic environmental assessment should be carried out to protect the environment before the project is planned. The strategic environmental assessment is a contribution to promote sustainable development. This relates to the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> also, which has to be transmitted into national law at the end of 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes to assist the Member States in working out appropriate methods for strategic evaluation and corridor analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission would recall that, in line with the principles of good governance, it is undertaking a detailed impact study of the recommendations of the High Level Group which, under the chairmanship of Mr Van Miert has identified a number of priority TEN-T projects. This study, which will consider the impact on all aspects relating to sustainable development, will be taken into account in the forthcoming adoption of the Commission proposal on revising the TEN-T guidelines in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p>From a legal point of view, Community legislation will only apply in the new Member States from accession onwards. However, the Commission takes the view that they should apply and implement the provisions of the environmental acquis during the pre-accession period. In cases where Community pre-accession funding of large infrastructure developments is involved, 'similar standards' as set by Community environmental legislation need to be applied before any Commission funding is given to the accession countries.</p>

<p>(FR) A distinction needs to be made between three types of loading units:</p>
<p>Containers which comply with ISO standards will continue to move freely in Europe. These containers account for over 91% of the capacity of the world fleet of loading units. However, it should be emphasised that they are not optimised for intermodal transport and logistics in Europe, which means they are ill-suited to and rarely used for intra-European transport.</p>
<p>Containers which do not comply with ISO standards,<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> particularly those over 40 feet long, account for nearly 4% of the said capacity. These containers may continue to be used for sea, river or rail transport, but they do not comply with the maximum dimensions authorised for roads in Europe. They cannot, therefore, be transported by road.</p>
<p>Swap bodies used in Europe account for approximately 2.7% of the capacity of the world fleet of loading units. They are specific to the continent, which explains why they are frequently seen. Unlike the two preceding categories, the majority of swap bodies do not come under the Convention for Safe Containers. They are standardised at European level by the CEN<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, but there are several models which are not standardised. The variety of models causes handling problems during transhipment.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal has three objectives:</p>
<p>To extend controls carried out by the national authorities within the framework of the International Convention on Safe Containers to swap bodies which do not currently come within its scope.</p>
<p>To simplify handling by ensuring that the equipment used to handle containers can be used to handle swap bodies. This is the objective of the project to standardise handling and stowing interfaces for the new intermodal loading units (ILU). The idea is to come into line with the configurations of these interfaces for ISO containers.</p>
<p>The main objective of the proposal for a directive is to launch a European intermodal loading unit (EILU). Use of the EILU will not be compulsory. It will have advantages which will help it to win market shares, because it will be a compromise between the solidity of a container and the capacity of a swap body. In addition, it will be suitable for travel both by sea and waterways and by rail and road. The tasks relating to the finalisation of handling arrangements for the new ILUs and the definition of the EILU will be entrusted to European standardisation organisations (such as the CEN), which will liaise with the ISO. If the CEN can find a technical solution for a unit which respects the guide spacing in cellular container ships, while allowing two front palettes to be loaded, the problem will be resolved.

With the opening of the second, ‘regional negotiation’, phase scheduled for September 2003, can the Commission confirm that the first phase has indeed proved sufficient ‘to enable a clear definition of the future EPAs’ objectives to emerge’, as called for by Parliament on 26 September 2002 in the resolution I had the honour of presenting as rapporteur?</p>
<p>The Commission announced that it would carry out impact studies of these agreements with a view to establishing free-trade areas.

<p>(EN) In the all-African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) phase, progress in substance has been slow. Much time was taken, especially at the beginning, for agreeing on organisational matters. However, in the last months, the ACP and the Commission have covered some ground. For example, since mid-June 2003 six meetings in the so-called 'dedicated format' have taken place, covering areas such as legal issues, the development dimension, services, agriculture, market access and trade related areas.</p>
<p>In terms of outcome of the discussions, the all-ACP – Commission talks have generated an overall understanding on important principles (for example on flexibility and regional integration). In many meetings, the development dimension of European Partnership Agreements (EPA) was at the centre of discussions, which has led to increasingly common views on this issue. For example, it was agreed that while EPAs would directly contribute to the development of ACP countries, they would need to be accompanied by appropriate development assistance so as to allow to maximise the benefits. Divergences remain notably on the question of additional resources.</p>
<p>The ACP side and the Commission agreed at the last meeting of ACP Trade Ministers on 31 July 2003 in Brussels, that the dialogue on the all-ACP level will continue when regional negotiations start from October onwards.</p>
<p>The Commission is working with the ACP on a joint report on the first phase for the next joint meeting on EPAs on ministerial level, which is envisaged for 1 October 2003 in Brussels. This event will be followed by the start of negotiations on a regional level with West-Africa and Central-Africa.</p>
<p>Studies and information</p>
<p>In terms of ex-ante assessments of the negotiations, work has advanced in the last months. The support programme of € 20 million for the preparations of EPA negotiations has proven to be a useful source for national and regional impact assessments by the ACP. As a first step, regional impact assessments were carried out for more than € 1,1 million. More recently, studies for 17 ACP countries have been kick started for a total of € 2,4 million. Furthermore, institutional capacity programmes for four countries and three larger regional support programmes for a total of € 600.000 and € 2,5 million, respectively, have been approved. Additionally to the € 20 million programme, more funds will be soon available for trade-related analysis: an all-ACP programme for trade capacity of € 50 million was approved by the European Development Fund (EDF) committee in July 2003 and should be operational by beginning/mid 2004. Regional and national programmes under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF offer considerable resources for negotiation-related analysis and capacity building. In the regional programmes alone, about € 350 million are foreseen for regional integration and trade, including EPA negotiations.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA) financed by the Commission will be summarised in a final report, expected for October. Before, the preliminary results will be discussed with civil society in two workshops in W-Africa and the Caribbean, in order to maximise stakeholder inputs and participation. The latest documents of the SIA are accessible on the webpage of the Consultant (.</p>
<p>On the question of transparency and, in particular, communication with the Parliament, both, the Commissioner in charge of Development and Cooperation, and the one in charge of Trade, have been active during the last year to answer questions and to report on the status of negotiations. Status of negotiations was also discussed in a number of meetings with civil society in Brussels, organised by the Commission. Documents regarding the negotiations have been posted on the Directorate General Trade website.

<p>(EN) While a final decision will be made in the autumn, it seems unlikely that the projects referred to by the honourable Member can be financed. The programme budget was heavily over-subscribed. Consequently, the great majority of applications, including many of very high quality and importance, simply cannot be funded.</p>
<p>The budget for the health determinants part of the new Public Health Action programme is roughly the same as that for the old 'Europe Against Cancer' programme (about €15 million). However, with the same amount, a much vaster range of activities needs to be financed. The cancer projects referred to by the honourable Member would use a budgetary bracket amounting to nearly the entire budget available for a vast field like health determinants. Bearing in mind that the 'Europe Against Cancer' programme has come to an end and that funding possibilities under the new Public Health Action programme for activities covered by the former are much more limited, these networks will need to pursue alternative sources of funding.</p>
<p>Community support for cancer prevention as such does, however, not come to an end; indeed, a number of cancer-related projects are likely to be funded under the present round of financing. These include projects on the establishment of cancer indicators, smoking prevention and smoking cessation, alcohol prevention and on nutrition. These projects should produce sustainable results that will also contribute to cancer prevention, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>As far as developing European guidelines for breast cancer screening is concerned, highly developed instruments are available. Reference is made here in particular to the 'European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening', the 4<span class="sup">th</span> edition of which will be published in 2004. The Commission will analyse carefully the need for any future updating of this document and the possibility of further support that could be given by the Community.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission participated fully in the recent OSPAR<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Ministerial meeting in Bremen referred to by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>As recalled in the ministerial statement at Bremen, the strategy concerning radioactive substances, which was adopted by OSPAR at Sintra in 1998, has the specific objective that by the year 2020 discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive substances are reduced to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels, resulting from such discharges, emissions and losses, are close to zero. The OSPAR commission is assisted in the implementation of this strategy by its Radioactive Substances Committee (RSC).</p>
<p>As the Community is a Contracting Party to the OSPAR Convention, it is represented at OSPAR meetings by the Commission and, as such, is firmly committed to the attainment of the objectives of the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances. The Commission, including the Joint Research Center, is an active participant in the RSC and its various working groups and contributes significantly to the understanding and awareness of the discharge of radioactive substances from all sources into the maritime area..</p>
<p>As part of this contribution, the Commission recently completed a study known as MARINA II, which examined all radioactive discharges and their effects on the OSPAR maritime area. MARINA II, which has been presented to OSPAR, has laid the scientific foundation for building a consensus on the definition of a baseline for radioactive substances against which progress on the implementation of the OSPAR strategy can be measured. Importantly, such consensus on the baseline was also reached at the Bremen ministerial meeting in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has recently outlined, in a communication to the Council and the Parliament, a framework for an Union strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment. Action 10 of that communication provides for a review of the OSPAR process and for consideration of the need for additional Community measures. Taking account of the outcome of the Bremen Conference, the Commission will consider what further actions are required in this context.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to journalists arrested in Laos while preparing a report on the Hmong in the province of Xieng Khouang, 5 or 6 groups of Lao Hmong are living there in desperate conditions. These groups, who are forced to live on a diet of roots, ‘have been subjected to a policy of brutal repression by the Vientiane authorities for decades. With no other weapons but old AK-47s and patched up M16s, and with no ammunition, ‘they aspire to peace and a normal life’. According to the journalists, no solution will be found without mediation by ‘a third party’, since the Lao Hmong have no confidence in the Laotian authorities.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the tragic situation of the Hmong people in Laos? What initiatives does it intend to take to end the fierce repression they have suffered for almost 40 years? Would the Commission be willing to act as a mediator between the Hmong groups and the Vientiane government with a view to achieving a rapid and fair solution to the problem, and is it prepared to launch an exceptional operation to offer the 2 000 or so Hmong refuge on EU territory?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that ethnic minority groups in Laos often face difficulties. Many of them live in the impoverished upland areas, particularly in the north of the country, and have limited access to social services such as education and health. Some groups, among them the Hmong, also frequently encounter suspicion from the administration, even if legal discrimination does not seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of reports of clashes between Laotian 'security forces' and some armed Hmong groups. The Commission is also aware of recent reports on the living conditions of these particular groups.</p>
<p>The Commission has stated on several occasions that it is concerned about the human rights situation in Laos and that it will examine these questions in view of the next meeting of the EC-Lao People’s Democratic Republic Joint Committee. During this meeting, the Commission will have the possibility of raising the difficulties faced by ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>At this stage the Commission has not been invited to take on a role as mediator between particular Hmong groups and the Government of Lao PDR. The Commission will, however, continue to make use of all instruments available in the framework of its political dialogue with Laos to raise issues of concern.</p>
<p>As regards the idea of receiving 2.000 Hmongs into the Union, this is a topic to be discussed with the Member States in the appropriate fora.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0493"></a>

<p>(FR) The study on island and outermost regions was carried out during 2002. It was based on a broad range of statistical databases, including the regional databases of NewCronos/Eurostat and various national and local sources.</p>
<p>As far as the Ionian islands are concerned, the Greek National Statistics Office was contacted and supplied a number of variables which are recorded in the database containing all the quantitative information provided by the study.</p>
<p>During the course of the study, several other Greek sources were contacted, mainly the Greek meteorological service, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of the Marine and the University of the Aegean Sea. As far as per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is concerned, the results of the study appear to be reliable, although the data available only cover a NUTS II and III regional level. The regions do not always coincide with the archipelago or the individual islands.</p>
<p>This study was a first attempt to study the island regions and territories in a harmonised manner at European level. It allowed very diverse situations to be identified in these territories and also highlighted the lack of harmonised data.</p>

<p>On various occasions in recent months, the E17 Antwerp-Ghent-Lille motorway has been the scene of incredible accidents involving lorry drivers. Lorries are gradually being fitted with cruise control equipment. Inattentive drivers are driving at top speed into the back of traffic jams caused by road works.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated problem. Throughout Europe there are lorry and car accidents caused by cruise control. Such accidents cost lives. Over the last few weeks in Belgium alone, six people have died and 13 have been seriously injured in accidents involving cruise control.</p>
<p>Transport trade unions, too, consider that cruise control does their driver members more harm than good.</p>
<p>Is the Commission sufficiently well informed about the road safety impact of cruise control in lorries?</p>

The Commission is concerned by the increase in accidents involving lorries, where the use of speed regulators appears to play a part. It is trying to collect objective information from the Belgian authorities which will enable it to evaluate any possible measures needed.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have any convincing data on the impact on road safety of speed regulators in lorries. On the contrary, studies – including in the Netherlands – have demonstrated that these regulators reduce fuel consumption by between 4 and 10%. They also help responsible drivers to keep to the speed limit.</p>
<p>As with other equipment in vehicles, it is clear that speed regulators require responsible use on the part of drivers. For example, it is not advisable to use these regulators in heavy or unstable traffic or in bad weather conditions. Nor does the Commission plan to ban the general use of speed regulators in lorries. It feels it is more important to improve the training of professional drivers, on which a directive was adopted by Parliament and the Council recently, and control of driving and rest times via the digital tachograph to be introduced in a year's time and via a larger number of controls, which are being planned within the framework of the next review of Directive 88/599<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

<p>Finally, it should be emphasised that anyone who considers their basic rights to have been violated has the possibility of recourse before the European Court of Human Rights, after all internal means have been exhausted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

At the same time, the banks are multiplying their profits by charging interest rates of more than 11% on overdrafts and a number of other products, while big business receives preferential treatment through the possibility of investing in public and private securities which yield far greater rates of interest than savings accounts but are not available to the general public.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for its question concerning the erosion of savings of ordinary people in Greece.</p>
<p>At the outset the Commission would like to recall that, within a context of heightened financial market integration in the Union, a common monetary policy and a single currency in the euro area, market conditions for financial institutions in Member States are increasingly competitive. However, individual financial institutions, whilst being influenced by common factors such as a change in the market borrowing/lending rate, may still decide the conditions applied to their customers according to their own individual strategy, balance sheet and other considerations. For example, in times of weak economic growth, financial institutions may decide to give more weight to risk considerations than otherwise.</p>
<p>Investment in securities bring the potential for greater return than cash deposits but this is in exchange for greater risk to capital, so care needs to be taken in comparing the returns available from deposit accounts and securities. As regards the situation in Greece that the honourable Member refers to, the Commission is currently not aware of any discriminatory access to investment products for Greek citizens, although the Commission has in the past dealt with a case of fiscal discrimination of the income derived from investment funds. This case was investigated by the Commission and, following the commitment of the Greek authorities to rectify the situation, was closed in 2002. Should any additional and more precise information be brought to the Commission's attention, it will investigate the matter further.</p>
<p>The Commission has consulted the Greek Competition Authority on the existence of a collusion or an abuse of a collective dominant position by financial institutions in Greece. The Greek Competition Authority does not have any significant indications that can lead to the suspicion of an infringement of competition law but it will keep a close look at the relevant market and will conduct an investigation in case there is a behaviour that can possibly harm competition.</p>
<p>In addition, at this stage, from the Commission market monitoring experience, there are no concrete indications of an infringement of articles 81 or 82 of the EC Treaty. However, the Commission would reconsider this conclusion if it becomes aware of concrete evidence of a competition law infringement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0514"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Member of Parliament about the growing problem of child pornography distributed through the Internet. It believes there is need for continuous efforts to combat harmful and illegal content on the Internet through international co-operation amongst governments, particularly law enforcement and judicial authorities, but also between governments and the Internet industry, dedicated hotlines and non-governmental organisations to effectively tackle this horrifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for dealing with illegal content (including child pornography) lies with the appropriate law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Member States, which co-operate internationally in the fight against child pornography on the Internet through the existing channels of communications, such as Europol and Interpol.</p>
<p>However, the Union has been a forerunner in the fight against illegal and harmful content since 1996, thanks to the joint approach adopted by the Parliament and the Council. The Safer Internet Action Plan adopted by the Council and the Parliament in 1999 <a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a major element in the Commission’s activity in this field. It provides funding for a European network of hotlines allowing users to report illegal content, including child pornography. In March 2002 <a href="#defann_64_2" name="refann_64_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, on the basis of a Commission proposal, the current Action Plan was extended for a second phase of two years, in line with a review that took account of past experience and new technologies, so as to ensure co-ordination with parallel work in the field of network and information security.</p>
<p>The Union strategy to combat child pornography also consists of legal instruments and practical measures against computer crime and child pornography. These include the Commission proposal for a Council Framework Decision <a href="#defann_64_3" name="refann_64_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on approximation of laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet <a href="#defann_64_4" name="refann_64_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which the Commission hopes the Council will be able to adopt formally in the very near future, and the Council Recommendation of September 1998 <a href="#defann_64_5" name="refann_64_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and the Council Decision of May 2000 to combat child pornography on the Internet <a href="#defann_64_6" name="refann_64_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As an example, at the beginning of 2003, the Commission received the final version of the 'International Child Exploitation Database' feasibility study, which was co-funded under the STOP II Programme and run by a project group composed by experts from several Member States. The project group has issued various recommendations, highlighting the need for introducing a sophisticated networked international child sexual exploitation image database, building on the fledgling system at Interpol. Such a database, would have to take into account the different national laws governing images of child sexual exploitation and protection of personal data.</p>
<p>In March 2003, the Commission received an application by several Member States, Europol and other third Countries under the AGIS programme for funding an implementation study as a concrete follow-up to a feasibility study concluded in December 2002. Applications are now being evaluated according to the rules of the funding programme. The final funding decision will be announced by autumn.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Safer Internet Programme provides funding for activities aimed at combating illegal and harmful content, as part of a coherent approach by the European Union. ‘Safer Internet’ aims at:</p>
<p>ensuring more extensive interfacing with programmes and actions conducted at national level,</p>
<p>improving exchange of information and best practice between Member States,</p>
<p>developing software enabling parents and/or teachers to limit children’s access to inappropriate material and content on the Internet,</p>
<p>offering dedicated web services which provide safe access to the Internet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
