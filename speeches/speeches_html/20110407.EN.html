<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">George Sabin Cutaş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(RO)</span> Mr President, the presentation of this report on the activities carried out by the European Investment Bank is part of an annual democratic exercise which comes under the responsibility the Bank has to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this exercise is carried out on a regular basis, it must not be trivialised as it includes recommendations on important matters for the future of the European Union. Once the Treaty of Lisbon came into force in December 2009, the European Investment Bank became an instrument for supporting the European Union’s external policies, while also acting as an important partner for driving the Union’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my fellow Members for the improvements they have made to the report. I would also like to thank the entire bank’s staff for their excellent cooperation, especially President Maystadt and Vice-President Kolatz-Ahnen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all looking for a method of reconciling Member States’ growing debts and deficits with economic growth targets set out, for example, in the EU 2020 strategy, which require major investments in education, health, technology, sustainable energy and infrastructure. I think that the solution to this problem is a European one, with the European Investment Bank having an important role to play in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will present here two significant examples of the way in which the European Investment Bank has boosted and will continue to boost the European economy. Firstly, there are the loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and then, project bonds. We must not forget that 99% of European businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises. Investing in SMEs is a means of making a significant contribution to the innovation, research and development activities taking place in the European Union. The European Investment Bank offered small and medium-sized enterprises funding above its annual target of EUR 7.5 billion in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Microfinance Facility was also created in 2010, pooling funds amounting to EUR 200 million, assigned to those who need micro-credits. However, we notice that difficulties persist at the point where entrepreneurs access the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to enhance the transparency of the procedures used to select the Bank’s financial intermediaries and for providing loans to them. It is also the European Investment Bank’s duty to offer technical assistance and cofinancing to the convergence regions in order to allow them to absorb the funds available to them at a higher rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject which I want to touch on is project bonds. Are we entitled to place such great hopes on this financial instrument? I think that we are. Its purpose is to increase the credit ratings of the bonds issued by companies, by attracting private investments, so as to supplement domestic investments and those made via the cohesion funds. Thanks to this multiplier effect, the companies will obtain more money for implementing infrastructure projects in the areas of transport, energy, IT and sustainable development. It is important to focus on certain key projects, such as sustainable development, the road and rail infrastructure, and connecting ports to European markets and those which will allow energy independence, like the Nabucco gas pipeline or the ITGI project.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are discussing today possible solutions for exiting the financial crisis, this brings us to the subject of transparency and tax havens. The lack of transparency from financial intermediaries has taken the specific form of tax evasion and fraud and has contributed to the tough situation we are currently faced with.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the duty of the European Investment Bank, as a European bank, not to get involved in operations carried out through non-cooperative jurisdictions, as identified at the moment by various international bodies. At the same time, these lists are still not enough. The European Investment Bank can make its contribution in this area by carrying out proper assessments and publishing its results on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to mention the role played by the Bank outside the European Union, in countries en route to joining the EU and those coming under the remit of cooperation and development policies. In these countries, the European Investment Bank supports the European Union’s foreign policy objectives. This is why I think that we need to both assign more specialised staff in this area and raise the participation level of local actors in the project.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to listen to the views of those of you in the Chamber and to speak again at the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Philippe Maystadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the EIB. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, may I thank you for inviting me once again to take part in the debate on your report on the activities of the European Investment Bank – this is becoming a real tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, in particular. He had the good sense not to look at matters only in retrospect, but provided guidelines for the future as well. This is essentially what I should like to talk to you about, if I may. You mention that our Board of Directors has devised a three-pronged approach to the European Investment Bank’s work over the next few years. We will develop our work in three areas: the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, the fight against climate change and support for EU external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When faced with the financial, then economic, crisis that erupted in 2008, the Member States provided a short-term response: the various national plans, which were intended initially to keep the banks afloat and then to stimulate an economic recovery. Those national plans, as you know, were supported by the European economic recovery plan, adopted by the European Council in December 2008. The EIB played its part by increasing the volume of its lending from EUR 48 billion in 2007 to EUR 79 billion in 2009, and by channelling that injection of funds into the real economy towards the areas described as a priority by the Council, in particular, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, as your rapporteur has just emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, after that short-term response, which enabled us to avoid the worst, a longer-term response is now needed. That is where the Europe 2020 strategy comes in, and the critical part of that strategy is the increase in the employment rate and productivity, which must be based on what is often called the knowledge triangle: training, research and innovation. The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of that strategy. Back in 2010, it provided more than EUR 4 billion in finance for projects in the education sector and more than EUR 7 billion for RDI – research, development and innovation – projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB intends to increase its financing in those areas and, to that end, it intends to continue to implement, together with the European Commission, joint financing instruments on the model of the RSFF – the Risk Sharing Finance Facility – for research, as instruments of that kind give the European budget leverage. With the same amount of funds, the European budget can bear a much greater volume of investment and, at the same time, these joint instruments relieve the capital constraint on the EIB. This means that, with the same amount of capital, the EIB can increase the volume of its lending.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned the RSFF, the Risk Sharing Finance Facility for research. It is a good example. At the end of 2010, with a budget contribution of some EUR 390 million and an EIB capital allocation of some EUR 700 million, we were actually able to lend more than EUR 6 billion, which financed more than EUR 16 billion of investment in research. You can therefore see the two kinds of leverage that such an instrument affords, and so it seems clear to us that the EIB’s contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy will be all the more effective because we will be able to rely on pragmatic cooperation with the Commission and with other financial institutions, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area: the fight against climate change and its sometimes tragic consequences. This has become a priority for the European Union, and hence also for the EIB. The Fukushima nuclear accident and the questions to which it gives rise further strengthen the need for huge investment in energy saving, renewable energies and new energy technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010, EIB loans for projects directly contributing to a reduction in the volume of greenhouse gas emissions increased to almost EUR 20 billion, or almost 30% of our total lending. The loans for renewable energy projects accounted for EUR 6.2 billion of our total lending, and were used mainly for wind and solar power projects. The loans for energy efficiency improvement projects increased to EUR 2.3 billion in 2010. They will increase further over the next few years, as there is huge potential for energy saving, particularly in public buildings and homes in many European towns and cities. As for investment to develop urban transport, and hence to reduce pollution from individual means of transport, the EIB provided EUR 7.9 billion in loans in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we are going to continue this effort. We are going to continue to support energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies, and we are also spearheading the development of a methodology – an inevitably complex one, given the technical difficulties – to evaluate more precisely the carbon footprint of all the projects that we finance. This particular effort testifies to our will to make the fight against climate change a major priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to conclude, the third area: no power can expect to conduct an external policy without financial support. China has learnt that. It intervenes financially throughout the world in order to support its external policy objectives. If the European Union really does want to develop an external policy that has some influence in the world, then it too must have a financial arm. If the European Union so wishes, the EIB can be that arm. That is one of the conclusions of the Camdussus report on the EIB’s external mandate. It remains to be seen whether the Member States, which are also shareholders of the EIB, will act on that recommendation and make a clear decision when preparing the financial perspective for 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there you have an overview of the EIB’s three-pronged approach for the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would first like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, for his very good report. I would also like to welcome Mr Maystadt to this plenary because it is very important that the Commission also congratulate him and the EIB for his continued forceful response to the effect of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">EIB assistance was essential. The EIB helped us to address the credit shortage in the market and this was crucial, not only for the EU Member States and the candidate countries, but also for our partners around the world. The EIB was able to significantly increase its lending activity and, at the same time, to target the increase to the key growth-enhancing areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the Parliament’s view that support for the EU cohesion policy, as well as transition to low carbon economies, are core targets for the EIB. Consequently, the Commission joined forces with the EIB Group to support convergence regimes with the joint financial instruments which we know very well – JASPERS, JEREMIE, and the new addition, ELENA – to fight climate change. Moreover, we welcome the increase in lending volume to SMEs and we agree with your call for more qualitative measures to increase the value added and transparency of the EIB Group intervention in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, an assessment of the optimal division of labour between the EIB and the EIF seems to be necessary. The huge efforts undertaken by the EIB bring into focus the importance of optimising the use of EIB capital. It is crucial to strike the right balance between higher volumes and high-risk activities which consume more capital but add more value to the EIB Group intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a couple of words on financial instruments. We believe that the use of innovative financial instruments, together with the key financial institutions such as the EIB, should be extended. Instruments using instant loans, equity and guarantees help maximise the effects of the EU budget by attracting additional funds from third parties. In addition, an increased use of joint financial instruments and risk sharing with the EU budget could have the effect of freeing capital and permitting a higher leverage of the EIB own resources and enhancing its reach. At the end of the day, this means more projects in support of a Europe 2020 strategy and better support for its goals and objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, which is currently in public consultation, is a very good example. The EU 2020 strategy calls for large-scale cross-border investment to underpin the EU 2020 flagship actions and develop smart, upgraded and fully interconnected infrastructures. The project bond initiative would support the financing of specific projects in the area of transport, energy and communications infrastructure, and potentially also in other sectors that can help lay the foundations for sustainable future growth and employment. I am glad to see your support for this initiative in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the preparation of the Commission’s proposals for the next multiannual financial framework, the Commission is carrying out a strategic reflection and analysis to ensure an optimised use of the new instruments, in dialogue with the EIB and other financial institutions, to benefit from their financial expertise and experience in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to make a few remarks on the EIB’s external activities. Regarding EIB financing outside the EU, the Commission supports the increase of the ceilings proposed by Parliament under the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate, in particular a EUR 1 billion increase for the Mediterranean region. We know how important that is today. This is essential in order for the EIB to pursue its intervention at a sustained level and support the democratic transformation of our partner countries. In the same way, we also reiterate the importance for the EIB to reuse reflows from previous investment in the Mediterranean region in order to make risk capital investment in private sector SMEs in the region. Moreover, we support a progressive reinforcement of the EIB’s development capacity because these additional needs would require a gradual increase of staff resources specialised in development aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the Commission’s proposal following the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate, the Commission will set up a working group to study the possible development of the EU platform for cooperation and development. The objective is to optimise the functioning of mechanisms, blending grants and loans involving the Commission, the EIB and other multilateral and bilateral institutions. The establishment of such a platform would help create synergies and foster cooperation between the EIB and other financial institutions. In this context, I would like to mention that the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD was signed early in March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the subject of security, Mr Maystadt, you said that you wish to become the power behind, and the financial arm of, the European Union. Yes, but with a triple A rating. Moreover, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have been saying for years that you should be subject to prudential regulatory supervision. We propose that this supervision be carried out either by the European Central Bank, or, on the basis of a voluntary approach by the EIB, by the new European Banking Authority, with or without the involvement of one or more regulators, and we call on you, Commissioner, to make proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by mentioning our proposal for the European Union to become a member of the European Investment Bank, so that that intergovernmental instrument can gradually become a Community one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The legitimate question today is to ask where that funding can come from. The important element of the response to this question lies with the European Investment Bank and its family of institutions. I also think that it is important to remember that in the years to come, we will have huge global competition for funding. We will have national budgets in a mood of further cuts. We will have also a banking sector with a lot of uncertainties when it resumes normal funding activities and, of course, we will have a European budget that will remain, as usual, too small to be efficient and to solve our problems. So the EIB will be absolutely essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Compliments also on the overview which he gave us here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to comment on one particular aspect, namely, the relationship between the Council and Parliament. The European Parliament is a colegislator for the external mandate of the European Investment Bank, for all of the bank’s activities outside the EU, in neighbouring countries and in developing countries. The Council, however, seems to be finding it extremely hard to take this Parliament’s proposals on the review of the external mandate seriously. To my surprise, the Council is making quite a habit of coolly dismissing all kinds of new proposals put forward by this House as ‘unacceptable’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking, in particular, about proposals for the EIB taking an active role when it comes to measures to tackle climate change and for a greater role for the EIB in microfinancing. Are these proposals ‘unacceptable’? Is it the Council’s job to define the scope of the topics which the European Parliament is allowed to discuss? No, the European Parliament and the Council are colegislators on an equal footing, and, together with and in close contact with the European Commission, should jointly determine the rules governing the EIB’s external activities. That calls for consultation, for joint deliberations, for compromise, for an open attitude on the part of both the legislators. It is nonsensical and counterproductive, then, to use the word ‘unacceptable’ to describe proposals which a large majority of the European Parliament believe to be important. Now, such an out-of-touch attitude on the part of the Council is what is unacceptable, if you ask me. The fact that no one from the Council is present here is absurd and illustrative of how out of touch they are.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB is an essential tool for the EU’s external activities throughout the world. A public bank, a bank which can contribute to economic growth and the improvement of infrastructure with loans, is indispensable to the development of our neighbouring countries. The same applies to our relationship with developing countries. There, too, a public bank is vital. Such a bank must observe the Treaty of Lisbon and its objectives. Poverty reduction is one such objective. The European Parliament wants to lay down that role for the Bank clearly in its external mandate. I expect an open and constructive attitude on the part of the Council, which will enable us to arrive at that clarification together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we started working on this report, there was already an obvious need for long-term investment because of what had happened in the European Union. The crisis showed that we were too short-sighted in our work, as Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa would have said. We genuinely need long-term investment, and your institution plays a major role.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that has happened recently – I am thinking, in particular, of the Southern Mediterranean and of the awareness, perhaps, of a number of difficulties with regard to our energy choices – is all the more reason to encourage you in your work and to support you. There will always be MEPs in this House who support the work that you do. I agree, however, with what Mr Audy said: it is also very important to move in the direction of increased supervision, as we have done for a number of institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">What I mean is that, although I personally am in favour of project bonds and of many of the ideas that are circulating at the moment, I am very anxious to ensure that we do not rush into the solution of public-private partnerships without looking more closely at exactly how they are set up and what they will ultimately cost taxpayers and all those who are involved in them. I believe that they could be a very useful tool, but there are also funds in place in Europe at the moment – I am thinking of the Marguerite Fund and of the work of the deposit and consignment offices that have taken initiatives across borders – and I therefore wanted to argue for greater long-term investment and monitoring that are suitable for what we are trying to achieve together. I believe that that is the very least we should expect.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we support you and we would like to see all the recent events that have taken place encourage more far-reaching, broader debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO<span class="sub">2</span>.</p>

The result has been to establish ESAs, which are fully scrutinised by this Parliament. However, in this new age of accountability after the financial crisis, and in the light of the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, we need to establish comparable levels of oversight and scrutiny of existing EU institutions, including the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">Given how central the role of the EIB has become in financing EU Member States’ strategies and EU overseas activity, it is now time to improve the level of accountability of its activities to this Parliament. The loan book and the general banking and lending activities of the EIB need to be assessed in the same way as we would assess our commercial banks. They need to be subjected to rigorous stress testing and all financial activities need to remain on the balance sheet. When leverage or risk is employed, we should be sanctioning the risk limits, as ultimately any default means that it is the taxpayer who will pay again. It is time for this Parliament to seek a closer role in scrutinising the activities of the EIB, especially as the Bank’s role increases in developing new financial instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know.</p>
<p class="contents">From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives.

I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report.

<p class="contents">To get back to my specific points: the European Investment Bank (EIB) is an important instrument in three areas. I believe what Mr Klute says should form part of a strategy in the outside world. It is appalling to see how Chinese investors, state investors, are increasingly undermining political systems on the grounds that they are involved in a couple of local bridge building projects. When one looks for the contribution of the European Union, there is practically nothing to be found. I think you should continue on this path.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns small and medium-sized enterprises, which are being wantonly neglected by the traditional banks that are oriented solely towards maximising profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the change in energy policy. While the disaster involving the Japanese reactor is indeed a tragedy, it could provide a following wind for you to do something in this respect here in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the <span class="italic">caisse des dépôts</span> and <span class="italic">cassa dei depositi</span> − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank needs to deliver more, better, faster results. The importance of its role in funding projects across all sectors of the economy in the interests of the European Union has been even further amplified by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis has made it difficult to access credit, and it has also highlighted the need for a thorough rethinking of our economic model. The EIB has a critical role to play. To fulfil this role, it must maintain a high level of solvency and a financial position strong enough to enable it to access funding in capital markets on favourable terms. It must also have instruments available to allow necessary projects to be undertaken which would otherwise gain no financial backing from commercial banks, and which would find it very difficult to obtain funding on favourable terms elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB achieved some positive results in 2009, when its activity increased by 40%, its funding for small and medium-sized enterprises increased by 55%, its funding for less-developed regions increased by 36%, and its funding aimed at combating climate change and promoting energy efficiency increased by 73%</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is much to be done and accomplishment of the European Union’s strategic objectives still requires sustainable, long-term funding. The availability of such funding has diminished as a result of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to promote Eurobonds. We need to introduce new instruments and new developments in the field of financial engineering, and we also need to create a common platform to include other international financial institutions. This must also be accompanied by an improvement in the EIB’s own governance and a review of its internal mandate. In short, the EIB should be a bridge effectively linking investment to the needs of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these is the need to focus our efforts more and more on making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to have access to credit. I also welcome the reference to the project bond initiative, which I believe is a useful tool for growth and development in a sector as strategic as that of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am somewhat puzzled by the reference to the EIB’s external activities, for which more financial and human resources are being requested. The EIB report for 2009 indicates the countries benefiting from such loans, and I note with disappointment that Turkey receives the lion’s share with almost a third of the total granted to all non-EU states. This figure is also just over a quarter of the amount granted to Italy, one of the main EIB shareholders. Italy itself is also in need of substantial loans and grants. I therefore consider this to be an absurd imbalance. I believe it is unacceptable that vast resources should be granted to a country like Turkey, which is outside the EU and, in my view, should always remain so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Investment Bank undoubtedly plays a fundamental and very important role in Europe’s development. However, I would like to make a few comments on the report and about what was said in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I support, from an internal perspective, the European Investment Bank’s policy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. I think that this issue is much more important for Europe than climate change. This is where the bank needs to focus its efforts, and not so much on the development of green technologies. Though, this area will also be developed if small and medium-sized enterprises are supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, from an internal perspective, I also agree with the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control on possible supervision by the European Banking Authority, which is the new body responsible for taking such actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the data which Mr Morganti just quoted is extremely alarming. I agree, too, with the view expressed that, especially in the case of foreign investments, it is appropriate also to have parliamentary control because it is unacceptable for external countries to receive more European funds than European countries receive themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Recent reforms in economic governance linked to the effects of the crisis could lead to less funding being set aside by Member States for important projects such as the creation of infrastructures of strategic importance for the development of the Union as a whole. One example is the TEN-T rail transport project.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the European Commission’s project bond initiative. Project bonds represent an excellent solution for sourcing finance and underpinning the infrastructure Europe needs in order to modernise and to fully exploit the potential of the internal market. The EIB’s role in issuing and managing these bonds is therefore crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The report presses for an increase in funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, and I agree that the EIB’s activity must be focused and results-oriented. Mr President, allow me to say that some critical issues have emerged in relation to the Bank’s activity. In particular, I would like to point out that many small and medium-sized enterprises are often unable to take advantage of the opportunities on offer, as projects receiving funding require huge investment and organisation, which is effectively an obstacle to small and medium-sized enterprises taking part.</p>
<p class="contents">The time required for procedures is another problem. These are often muddled and bureaucratic, and out of step with the activities and requirements of the industry in question. I do not wish to reiterate the importance of these companies to our socio-economic fabric, and therefore I hope that a dialogue can be initiated with small and medium-sized enterprises that will help speed up procedures and eliminate as much red tape as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB can, and must, have an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean. Europe needs to think beyond the emergency and to implement a long-term strategy in order to ensure that funding and investment is made <span class="italic">in situ</span>, based on shared decisions, to promote democracy and development of the social and market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the European Investment Bank has a central role in the Europe 2020 strategy. This relates, in particular, to investments in green infrastructure. In order for it to be possible for the European economy to be strong and sustainable, more investments are needed in railways and ports. These must also be linked to road networks in effective transport hubs. The infrastructure must be made into a well-functioning whole. The European Investment Bank should be even more active in these key areas. This requires a new way of thinking when it comes to flexible finance solutions. European project bonds are an excellent step in the right direction, but these should be supplemented with more new financing options. Above all, I see an opportunity to develop a model in which there is more productive cooperation at European, national, regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Investment Bank has an important role in the EU’s development policy. There is definite potential for improvement there. The Bank’s activities should be made more transparent, they should be more locally based and be clearly focused on the main objectives of the Union’s development work. Environmental, poverty-related and development aspects should always be taken into consideration in the European Investment Bank’s decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While this fits neatly within the strategy to fight climate change, I am alarmed that the current criteria governing EIB funding lack transparency and accountability when it comes to the examination and due diligence of these projects. EUR 6 billion has been provided for wind farm developments across the EU, according to Mr Maystadt, but the EIB simply accepts the applications for funding from the governments concerned without scrutiny. I do not think that is good enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Renewable energy companies in the UK claim that their turbines have a load factor of 30%. In fact, over the whole of last year, their load factor was only 21%. They do not work when the weather is coldest and demand for electricity is at its peak. They are not economically viable and they will double or treble electricity prices for consumers while failing to cut CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.

<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, has pointed out to us that the guarantees for EIB activities in the EU budget amounted to almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009, which is a lot even for the EU, and therefore Parliament is quite justified, in my opinion, in expecting an explanation of the risks associated with this obligation. It would also be good to know more about how the interest from the loans provided is to be used, and about the administrative fees secured from the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB is answerable to the EU Member States, the Court of Auditors and OLAF. The proposal to introduce possible regulatory supervision, which would involve monitoring the quality of the finances, the financial situation, the precise measurement of results and compliance with the rules of the best practices included in the Cutaş report, looks like a good idea to me, and I would therefore like to recommend that the Commission seriously considers setting it up in the interests of greater transparency in the management of EU resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Convergence regions enjoy considerable support from the EIB.

It has shown that those countries that have a healthy balance between large concerns and small and medium-sized enterprises have come out of the crisis best.

I would like to assure them that the Commission is giving careful consideration to the question of EIB regulatory supervision. Indeed, there is a need for an appropriate supervision framework to ensure that the EIB’s excellent credit standing can be preserved at all times. However, the supranational nature of the EIB and the EIB statutory provisions, which form part of the Treaty, should be taken properly into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB has recently taken concrete steps to address the situation, in particular, through the enforcement of its audit committee, which has significant banking supervisory experience. In addition to this, since the EIB has been granted refinancing from the ECB, it complies also with the necessary reporting requirements vis-à-vis the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we believe that the European banking authority and the ECB cannot ensure the regulatory supervision of the EIB but, of course, we will not rule out the possibility for the EIB to fund other types of arrangements based on a voluntary approach by the EIB with other bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cooperation and the role of the Commission in cooperation with the EIB, here, I would like to underline that the Commission already has a significant role in the governance of the EIB in that it delivers an opinion on all EIB loans, on own resources, and has representatives sitting on the board of directors of the EIB. I can assure you that cooperation between the Commission and the EIB is exemplary and excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the supervision of the external EU programmes and the related discharge procedures, apart from the EIB activities under the aegis of the European Development Fund, meaning mostly the ACP investment facility, which are carried out under the specific EDF financial regulation, we are not aware of any other EU budget activity carried out in combination with EIB resources which are not subject to the usual discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Hübner, of course we fully agree with the calls to maximise the potential of the EIB by opening new leverages for increasing the potential to offer credits and help SMEs, especially at this time of post-financial crisis and pressure on credits. Therefore, we are also looking for innovative approaches on how to do this. I would just like to remind the House that the EU Financial Regulation has recently been modified to recognise explicitly this call for innovative instruments. We are already using it, especially in the programmes that are oriented towards financing research and innovation. I am sure that with the experience gathered from this project, the innovative financing tools can be used in other areas as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Philippe Maystadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the EIB. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am grateful to all the speakers for their comments, even though I felt that one of them was particularly inaccurate. Clearly, in the time I have available to me, I cannot respond in detail to all the extremely interesting issues that have been raised. Some of them, I think, could be examined in more depth in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there was the important issue raised by Mrs Hübner. If you want the EIB genuinely to be able to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular, through the development of joint instruments with the Commission, then the regulatory framework obviously has to allow it. Whilst you are currently debating the new draft financial rules, I think that you should be careful to ensure that the European Investment Bank will actually be able to make that contribution. The proposal made by the Commission seems to us, from that point of view, to be wholly appropriate. The Council and Parliament still need to accept it, though. You therefore have a part to play in reviewing the financial rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that a more in-depth study would also be worthwhile for other issues that have been raised: the issue of tax havens, which Mr Canfin addressed. I can confirm to him that the European Investment Bank has a stricter policy than the other international financial institutions on this issue, which also explains why we recently had to refuse to cofinance certain projects with the African Development Bank, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: they failed to meet the stricter criteria that we have in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I can tell Mr Canfin that it is out of the question for us to finance a promoter located in a country on the OECD’s blacklist, but I am quite prepared to examine this issue in more detail, together with the issues raised by Mr Klute, which included loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and transparency in that regard. I do not think that there are many financial institutions that are willing to give as much information about allocations to small and medium-sized enterprises, and I would stress that there has been a marked increase in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that have benefited from loans granted by the European Investment Bank to intermediary banks. More than 60 000 small businesses benefited from them in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight three features that make the European Investment Bank a rather unique institution. The first is that, contrary to what one of you said, we do not use taxpayers’ money. </p>
<p class="contents">To be clear, we do not ask the UK taxpayer for one single cent. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> We do not use taxpayers’ money; we use the funds that we raise every day on the world’s financial markets. Indeed, that is why it is essential for us to maintain our triple A rating. We borrow in Asia and the United States, and with the resources thus collected, we can finance projects on favourable terms. The only budgetary impact is the guarantee that is given concerning the political risk in implementing the external mandate granted to us by the Council and Parliament. Here, there is, in fact, a guarantee that has a provisional cost for the European budget, since we set aside 9% of all loans granted under the external mandate – we do so two years after the first disbursement – and, of course, this amount decreases as the loans are paid back. Therefore, since we do not actually have to use that guarantee, there is ultimately no cost to the European budget. None! It is important to realise, then, that we are clearly not an institution that costs taxpayers money.</p>
<p class="contents">The second feature: we are the only truly European financial institution; our shareholders are all Member States, and they are exclusively Member States of the European Union. We are the only financial institution that is legally obliged, under the Treaty, to financially support the European Union’s political objectives. Furthermore, we are the only financial institution that cannot finance a project unless it has already received the favourable opinion of the European Commission. The European Commission delivers that opinion after an assessment by all the services, by all the Directorates-General, from the Directorate-General for Competition to the Directorate-General for the Environment. We are therefore bound to strictly apply European rules and policies. We are subject to audits by the Court of Auditors to the extent required by the tripartite agreement. We cooperate at all times with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and I would add that we are on the verge of agreeing to supervision by the new European Banking Authority. In any case, as far as the European Investment Bank is concerned, we would be quite happy to submit to an official form of banking supervision. We are supervised indirectly, for example, by people with experience in banking supervision who we involve in our audit committee. However, I would confirm once again that we are completely open to proper supervision by this new European authority.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the third feature that I should like to highlight is the fact that the European Investment Bank is also rather unique because of the kind of expertise it has developed. We are an institution that permanently employs more than 100 engineers, plus a number of specialist consultants, which is rare for a bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have acknowledged experience and expertise in certain areas. To give you an example, we are called on to provide technical advice for projects that we cannot finance because they are based in a region outside our mandate. I therefore think that it would be a shame not to use that expertise. In certain areas, such as urban transport, energy efficiency, the water cycle and support for SMEs, the EIB has clearly developed expertise that is rather unique. I shall therefore conclude by saying that it would be a shame not to fully exploit that potential, through cooperation with the European Parliament that is perhaps more systematic and more structured.</p>
<p class="contents">Some very valid questions have been asked. We are financing more in Turkey simply because that is our mandate, decided jointly by the Council and Parliament. It has set us the task of financing more in the candidate countries, which means that we finance proportionally more in Turkey and in Croatia than in other countries. We are here to carry out the mandates that are given to us by the European authorities, in particular, by the Council and Parliament. I therefore believe that this justifies, perhaps, systematic and more structured cooperation with the European Parliament.</p>

We recommend for consideration the proposal that prudential supervision be introduced for this institution as well in the interest of the precise measurement of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation and its results, as well as compliance with effective and successful business practice. I would like to stress that we are not making this proposal because we have doubts about the regularity of the EIB’s activity but because, in our view, as a general rule, as the G20’s London Declaration clearly stated two years ago, ‘all systemically important financial institutions, markets, and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight’. We suggest calling on the European Commission to provide the European Parliament with the legal analysis of the options for the prudential supervision of the EIB by 30 November 2011, because under the effective legislation, no European institution has the right to supervise the EIB. However, in view of the increased role of the EIB, and also because of the extension of EU guarantees to it, changing this urgently is warranted. It would be justified to develop increased professional and social supervision, similarly to the practice which has evolved in recent times at other non-bank financial institutions. The EIB’s lending activity needs to become more selective, more effective and more result-oriented in the future, particularly as regards financing SMEs. To this end, information on loans granted must also be collected and published more systematically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

I am particularly happy since, three years ago in this Chamber, during a previous term of office, I had the privilege of presenting a report on a new strategy for animal health based on the principle ‘better prevention than cure’. Today’s amendment to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue is a practical realisation of this very principle. We are improving protection against this disease, and we are contributing to better animal health. Costs relating to their treatment will be lower and the whole vaccination process will be better organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment relates to the fact that the current directive from the year 2000 was adapted to conditions at the time and, in particular, to the vaccinations which were then available on the market. Those vaccinations had to be and still have to be administered, but with certain restrictions due to the fact that there is a danger of the virus being transferred from vaccinated animals to those which have not been vaccinated. This means that various restrictions are required during the vaccination process, for example, vaccinations being administered in specified areas and restrictions being applied to the movements of animals. This represents quite a burden for breeders and, as a result, the efficacy of these vaccinations is limited. Science has taken a step forward. We have second-generation vaccinations which have been tested and can be administered without any fear of transferring viruses to unvaccinated animals. As a result, they can be administered without applying the current restrictions. Therefore, administering these vaccinations will be beneficial for breeders, as they will be less of a burden and certainly more effective. It will be possible to administer them to a much wider extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Procedures are moving very quickly as far as this matter is concerned. The Committee on Agriculture carried out its work shortly after receiving draft legislation from the European Commission, and is now presenting it to Parliament. We are hoping that it will be possible to carry out mass vaccinations using the new vaccine during the summer season this year. This is the reason for the amendments and this is why Parliament, in its amendments to the report which I have tabled, has included timescales within which the legislation of Member States should be adapted to the requirements of the directive, so that the vaccinations can be carried out this year and we will not have to wait until the next season.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the controversy which has surrounded the report and the amendments to the directive concerning the correlation tables proposed by the Commission. In my report, we agree with the introduction of an obligation to include correlation tables which contain information regarding the transposition of the directive into national legislation and which specific provisions transpose provisions of the directive into national legislation. This is considered to be a bureaucratic requirement by the administrations of certain Member States, but it should be viewed differently. Thanks to the introduction of this requirement, European law will become more transparent. It will be easier for citizens to check whether a directive has been transposed into national legislation, and in what way. I think this is good practice. As far as I am aware, this is the first, or one of the first, directives to be adopted which introduces this requirement, and I think it does so quite rightly. This should become standard practice for our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Once more, I would like to thank you for allowing me to present the report and I feel that we are improving the lot of the breeders as well as reducing the suffering of animals in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the Commission is grateful to Parliament for its support for the proposal to further facilitate vaccination against bluetongue and for its recommendation in relation to this very important issue. In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, for his commitment to this cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Bluetongue has been the cause of a great deal of concern to all farmers in the European Union. Until the 1990s, bluetongue was considered exotic to the EU, with outbreaks only occurring sporadically in southern Europe. However, recent years have brought several epidemic waves of the disease, affecting many Member States, including in central and northern Europe, causing significant losses to livestock production and disruption of the trade in live animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The past few years have seen a significant improvement in the bluetongue situation across the EU, thanks in no small measure to massive vaccination campaigns largely cofinanced by the European Union. The EU cofinanced EUR 150 million in 2008, and allocated EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million for the following years. Under current rules, vaccination is only allowed in areas that are subject to certain restrictions because of the presence of bluetongue disease. The proposed amendments to the directive introduce the possibility of using inactivated vaccines everywhere in the European Union. The amendment would allow a wider use of preventive vaccinations against bluetongue and this will ensure better control of the disease and lessen the burden it causes to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report is most timely and important for the animal health situation in the European Union. The report rightly recognises the need for urgency in order to give Member States sufficient time to vaccinate animals before the next bluetongue season starts. We must not lose sight of the fact that, although the bluetongue situation has improved greatly in recent years, the disease has not been eradicated. The EU remains at risk for new epidemic waves of bluetongue in the future and it is important that Member States have the opportunity to protect animals against the virus when they are at risk. Member States should be able to optimise their vaccination programmes with the aim of reducing the impact of future bluetongue outbreaks in the European Union. Indeed, a number of Member States have already indicated that they wish to implement this measure at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur refers to the really very difficult issue of the correlation tables, which are very important for tracking the correct, appropriate transposition of EU legislation into national legal systems. This is a longstanding issue and we have had many debates in this House on how to control and monitor the proper transposition of EU law into national legal systems. We can see that the correlation tables are the best tool for doing this, monitoring it and assuring appropriate transposition of EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are very aware that, especially with such urgent issues as the one we are discussing today, we need to work very hard to find a solution between Parliament and the Council in order to avoid unnecessary blockages. I hope that the Council will demonstrate sufficient flexibility so that this legislation can be adopted on time before the start of the season in which bluetongue can break out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a disease that affects ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. It can result in the animals dying. The new inactivated vaccines enable the risk of infection to be excluded, so that this vaccine can also be successfully used in areas where the disease has not yet occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">This will allow the Member States to use the vaccinations more effectively, significantly reducing the burden on the agricultural sector as a result of this disease. The new vaccines allow the disease to be combated on a genuinely broad front once and for all, and I hope that the Member States and farmers will take this opportunity. It provides greater safety, and it is unquestionably a major improvement in animal health.</p>
<p class="contents">The more we contain the spread of bluetongue using the new vaccines, the greater the opportunities to export farm animals for the benefit of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that the directive may enter into force and the new vaccines may be made available, it is, in fact, important that we take a decision quickly. On Monday, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sent out a clear signal by unanimously adopting the report, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will follow its lead in today’s plenary vote. I support the rapporteur’s call to leave the correlation tables in the report. After all, we cannot take decisions in Europe without the Member States providing information on how they are implemented. We also need this transparency – and I say this to the Council very clearly – in order to strengthen the credibility of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and constructive cooperation. Many thanks! The report will have our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Hitherto, we used an activated vaccine to fight this disease, the use of which entails the need to restrict the movement of animals to certain areas in order to prevent the virus from spreading to non-infected animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Use of the vaccine, use of vaccination, was therefore limited to areas where infected animals had been detected in the past. This was detrimental to the farmers affected, who suffered on two accounts: firstly, because of the disease, and secondly, because of the restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">All these problems can apparently be avoided through use of a new inactivated vaccine, which, in addition to preventing potential disturbances in the internal livestock market, will also enable the development of new, further-reaching – which is what really matters – prevention strategies for combating this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital for the livestock industry that we amend the directive to allow the use of this vaccine, and that we do this as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, adherence to our Treaties, particularly as regards correlation tables, should not be an excuse for not bringing this regulation into force before the summer. Such a delay would only cause further damage to farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Previous speakers have mentioned what this is actually about: a new effective vaccine. I would therefore like to use my few seconds to point out that this is perhaps the first tangible proof of what will happen in our agriculture when the climate changes dramatically. In Sweden, where I come from, the idea that we would have a disease like bluetongue in ruminants would have been completely unrealistic four or five years ago. It was a sporadic disease in southern Europe. Today, it is a reality and we have had our first epidemic. It is therefore very important for us now to get going with the vaccination, but it is also extremely important, when we talk about climate, the environment and the future, to realise that it is not only aridity and precipitation that will change. A major change in climate will also bring something quite different: disease epidemics and epizootics among both people and animals. We must bring this into the equation when we discuss the Europe 2020 strategy, for example. What direction do we intend to take? That is also important for us as legislators to understand. We can only take decisions on the basis of the knowledge that we have today, but we must have the flexibility to be able to take new decisions when we acquire new knowledge and – in this case – new vaccines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I am generally in favour of the principle behind this report, I would like to add that this vaccine should only be used when the competent authority identifies significant risk to the livestock population.

<p class="contents">It is important that the Commission and the Council recognise free area status within the EU and put safeguards in place for these areas. However, there still remains a significant risk within Europe that this disease may spread and, as a result, I believe it is necessary that Northern Ireland has the ability to use the vaccines. It is imperative that the competent authority monitor movements and impose trade bans where necessary to stop the spread of bluetongue and that good practice is followed by all of the actors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that all Member States work constructively together to reduce the risk of the spread of this disease and protect the industry from a major outbreak.

<p class="contents">Animal movement restrictions hit hard the economic resources of the locations or regions where they are imposed. With a preventive vaccination campaign, for example, under current legislation, a restriction zone must be maintained, even if no incidence of bluetongue has been recorded. This is why the measure proposed by the Commission is fair and economically beneficial to producers and consumers. At the same time, the measure is in keeping with the principle of using every scientific advance in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention the important contribution which the European funds have made so far to improving the situation with regard to bluetongue epidemics. The Union has cofinanced major vaccination campaigns, amounting to EUR 370 million in the last three years, as also mentioned by the Commissioner. I think that cofinancing of the vaccination programmes should also continue in the coming years, given their effectiveness and the new, much simpler legislative framework which we are debating today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disease causes intense suffering and death amongst the affected animals and has a measurable negative impact on the rural economy and the farming community. I welcome measures allowing Member States to use inactivated vaccination against bluetongue in areas not affected by the disease, and thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should be allowed the flexibility to be proactive and draw upon technological advances in vaccine production, thus reducing the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease and preventing occurrence without negating the disease-free status of the Member States, as was previously the case. Vaccination represents an effective veterinary measure in response to bluetongue which, when accompanied by further measures such as surveillance, means that eradication of the disease in Europe is a real possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Vaccination in controlling and eventually eradicating the disease will result in reduced economic losses and would be of benefit to European livestock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For too long, our vaccination strategy has been held back by the fact that we have not developed sophisticated enough products to allow vaccination of animals outside exclusion zones. Being in an exclusion zone can be disastrous for a farmer’s livelihood. It can also be disastrous not to protect your animals from disease, especially one as damaging and virulent as bluetongue. The development of new vaccines and the rules changes which I hope the Parliament will agree today will allow the UK to move to bluetongue-free status. It will allow freer movement of animals and save money in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is vitally important that these rules are brought into force as soon as possible. Farmers in the West Country need to be able to vaccinate before the end of May to ensure that animals are fully protected. All of us here understand the background to the interinstitutional battle raging over correlation tables, but I can tell you that the farmers I represent do not understand it and they rely on us, their elected representatives, to sort it out for them. This is an urgent issue and common sense must prevail. Let us get on with this now, agree a fast track for urgent issues of this kind, and get on and get our livestock vaccinated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the break-out of epidemics in a number of Member States in 2000, considerable economic damage has been caused. As always, whenever economic losses occur, the financial damage affects those at the bottom of the production chain most. In particular, the flourishing trade in breeding cattle collapsed. Despite vaccination, exports were completely paralysed in some countries. In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers had their livelihoods threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take the time now to take preventive action. The disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge at any time. We need to learn from experience and be able to offer assistance quickly. What was true ten years ago no longer applies. The old directive on measures to combat bluetongue from 2000 needs to be improved and updated.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers. The rules of that time were designed for the use of live attenuated vaccines, which were the only vaccines available at the time the directive was adopted 10 years ago. Today’s vaccines are more advanced. We need to take account of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the rapid action on the part of the Commission and of Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive. As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle. Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of breeders and farmers. Many thanks to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A more flexible procedure for the vaccination of livestock is necessary if we are to be able to combat epidemics such as bluetongue more effectively and reduce their impact on farming. Greater flexibility and prevention would undoubtedly be desirable for a number of animal epidemics.</p>
<p class="contents">A strict policy of non-vaccination such as we have long pursued in the EU is no longer relevant. Consequently, I am of the opinion that we are taking the right step here. I would also like to support Mrs Paulsen, who said that we must expect to see other animal epidemics in the near future as a result of climate change. This, in turn, suggests that we need a clear strategy, and here of course, we can correctly practise this. In this context, I would also like to reiterate that there should be no further discussion of culling in the Commission either.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of bluetongue, we have, of course, benefited from the fact that we supported research and now have an inactivated vaccine and are able to carry out comprehensive vaccination, which was previously very dangerous and very difficult. We are therefore in a new situation here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the rapporteur for having worked so quickly. Experience has taught us to expect the first outbreaks in late summer and autumn. The countries therefore need to elaborate vaccination strategies and also implement these.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Agnew, I would like to say that if you have a good vet, then he will recommend vaccination, because that is what is wanted by the vets that I know and it is what I have heard repeatedly during the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, that is not the end of it. The Commission needs to draw up implementing regulations and adapt these to the new process, and that needs to be done just as quickly as here in Parliament. I therefore call on the Commission to work quickly so that we can put this scientific progress to use before the end of the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, whether the vaccine is live attenuated or inactivated, given the current state of our knowledge, blood tests do not enable us to identify how the pathogenic organism entered the animal’s blood – in other words, whether it originated in a vaccine or in the wild. Therefore, unless a marked inactivated vaccine – that is, a vaccine of which the pathogenic organism is of vaccine origin – is developed, it will be impossible to distinguish between a vaccinated animal and an animal infected by the virus. Yet that is an essential condition if a region or a country is to be declared safe from any contamination. There is a great risk, therefore, that countries that are protected from any contamination will put up trade barriers between themselves and countries that use that inactivated vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the European Union has a duty to encourage ongoing research into a marked inactivated vaccine so as to ensure greater biosecurity within the Union, something which will enable us to combine our health and trade approaches more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new inactivated vaccines allow producers, for the first time, to exclude the risk of infection with this potentially highly dangerous disease, because the vaccines can now also be used in areas in which bluetongue has not previously been found. In view of this, we must repeatedly emphasise that agriculture – including exports of breeding animals – is an important factor in all the countries of Europe. Farmers therefore need to be able to take advantage of the latest knowledge in animal health, which has been used to develop these vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things that we now particularly need. Firstly, we need a rapid solution concerning practice in the European Union. Secondly, in my view, we just as urgently need an obligation for the measures introduced in the Member States to be notified; in other words, an obligation on the Member States to report to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Several of you referred to the problem of correlation tables. I would just like to remind you that the Conference of Presidents injected fresh impetus into tackling this issue, and has accorded it greater importance, notably in recognition of the problem of the transposition of EU legislation into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask whether it is really so difficult for the Member States to notify the Commission of the legal basis on which they transposed the EU regulation into their national legal order. Is it really so difficult? I am sure that when they are considering how to transpose legislation, they must do some preparation and decide how they intend to transpose it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all recognise the fact – and we have had several debates on this issue – that the European Union suffers when the transposition of EU law is uneven. In particular, on an issue as important as the one we are discussing today, incorrect transposition could have detrimental effects.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as I said in my opening remarks, I would emphasise that the Commission is clearly against unnecessary hold-ups. We are fully aware of the urgency of this matter. Therefore, I hope that, through increased flexibility and intensive negotiations, we can find a solution to this problem. The Commission will try to be as helpful as possible so that we can adopt this legislation before the beginning of the season for a potential bluetongue outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Commission’s readiness to implement this measure, I would like to assure Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Uggias that the Commission has done its part. Our implementing measures are almost complete. What we need is approval of this proposal by the legislator. Once we have that, we can proceed very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank our rapporteur and to thank the House for its strong support for this measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agriculture, thanks to whom we were able to proceed so rapidly and effectively with the report. It does not often happen that we are so unanimous in adopting a positive document which is obviously aiming to improve the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the correlation tables which were referred to in the discussion as a possible source of problems, I think that it would be difficult here to sympathise with the administrative bodies or governments of the Member States. Creating the tables and sending them to the Commission will really not be much of a problem. What is certain is that citizens who want to check whether their Member State’s legislation accords with European Union law will have greater problems. They are the ones who will have to put in the effort and research if there are no tables, as has been the case until now. It is very often difficult to find one’s way around EU legislation. I think and hope that this instrument will be available to anyone who is interested, not only the Commission, and that it will be a readily accessible document which will be available when needed. It will also be a very useful document.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Council not to take issue with the correlation tables, and if it must, not in this case, so that the new vaccinations can come into force during this season, as expected. We cannot allow any delays because this would negate our quick and efficient work. Thank you all once again for your cooperation on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, the Commission focused its attention on the responsibility of Member States in setting prices, without considering the specific point made by the petition, which was to report irregular imports of tomatoes and other vegetables from Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">These alleged irregularities have, in fact, already been noted for some years by the regulatory body OLAF, which has pointed to the abusive application of the method for deduction provided for by Regulation (EC) No 3223/1994, which establishes three different methods of calculation. The consequences of this situation are lower revenues for the European Union, unfair competition and breach of market rules, as well as the gradual impoverishment of European producers and exporters, with seriously alarming situations reported, in particular, in Spain, Greece, Portugal, France and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is negotiating a new bilateral agreement with Morocco, and once again this agreement seems to not be taking these alarming facts into consideration, but to be continuing along the path towards implementation of a flow of exports from Morocco to the European Union which is totally unregulated and does not comply with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a subject we should focus on. It is a subject which relates to and touches on a currently sensitive nerve, which is that of migration flows. In fact, this great mass of people coming from the countries along the North African coast, including Morocco, to the European Union often involves farm labourers, as the recent events in Rosarno show.</p>
<p class="contents">We are struggling to receive them. Above all, we are struggling as the European Union, and particularly as Italy, to offer them a livelihood. Further reducing the potential for agricultural production in our countries, and therefore in France, Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are having serious problems at the moment, would cause all kinds of damage. I would like to know what the Commission intends to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mrs Mazzoni for bringing up this question so we can clarify our position on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />First, I would like to assure the House that the Commission monitors the quantity of tomatoes imported from Morocco closely, attentively, using a cross-checking system based on designation of quantities imported by Moroccan operators and daily import records kept by national customs authorities. The Commission, until today, does not have any proof of systemic fraud or systemic failure of the system that was put in place. We have the information concerning one case, to which I will come back a little later. This is related to the year 2007, when OLAF indeed emphasised that the system as it stands at present could result in opportunistic behaviour but not necessarily involving irregular behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is recalled that the application of the entry price system and the levying of possible import duties in connection with this mechanism are the exclusive competence of the customs authorities of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect to this question, which is quite important, is the international context of this matter, something that is really dominated by the Doha Round, which has not yet been completed. Any change to the entry price system and its current application mechanism could have a detrimental impact on the results achieved so far. The new bilateral agreement with Morocco preserves the interests of the European producers by maintaining the system of monthly tariff quotas of tomatoes and strict control of the quantities imported.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the agreement provides for improved cooperation and greater transparency in terms of market data in the fruit and vegetable sector. The quantitative increase in the tomatoes quota has been limited to 52 000 tonnes, which is well below traditional trade levels, and the increase is progressive and staggered over four marketing years, thereby preserving current market shares and the traditional supply to the European Union. The Commission therefore considers that any change to the current entry price system must respect the terms of the relevant international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission ensures that the regulation is properly applied and therefore has carried out the investigation through OLAF. This is probably the case Mrs Mazzoni is referring to; whether there are irregularities as a result of incorrect interpretation of the implementing regulation. However, it is the responsibility of the national customs authorities to follow up on the results of the investigation. Recuperation is in progress but the publication of the data is strictly the responsibility of the competent customs authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the organisation of surveillance; this was one of the items that was raised by Mrs Mazzoni. Here, I have to say that the Commission, as I said, monitors tomato imports from Morocco using a cross-checking system. The quantities imported and reported by the Moroccan authorities on a weekly basis are monitored. The data is then compared with the data provided by the national customs authorities, who survey the system, and also by Eurostat. I think that we have very good and precise information and, if there were some systematic fraud and systematic irregularities, we would definitely spot it and take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are referring to the underpriced minimum rate which was set at approximately EUR 46 per 100 kg in a preferential import-export agreement between the EU and Morocco. According to EUROSTAT, Morocco exported over 70 000 tonnes of tomatoes in December 2010, which is over double the quota foreseen in the agreement between the EU and Morocco. This is what has caused heavy losses to European producers, never mind the losses from customs payments. OLAF has already commented on this matter, stating in its 2007 report that there may be irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco in connection with the underpricing of tomatoes in comparison with the initial price agreed by the EU, which, in effect, allows for the non-payment of additional customs duties. In adding my voice to that of other members of the Committee on Petitions, I would, however, like to ask whether the Commission has any intention of revising rules of this kind, and of possibly recovering the unpaid customs duties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 2008, there were about 100 000 tonnes in difference between DG TAXUD and Eurostat. The Commission answered that it had observed the problem and was solving it, but it is not clear to me whether the Commission will achieve what European citizens and European producers deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, we import tomatoes not only from Morocco but also from other third countries. We should find a way for negotiations to be very fair to everyone and not at the expense of the European agriculture sector. We should also find a way to control what we are importing from other countries outside the EU, especially in some northern European ports. Without effective border controls, the European agriculture sector will have a very difficult future.</p>
<p class="contents">If European production of tomatoes is damaged by the EU-Morocco Agreement, it will be very difficult to regain production on EU soil. The rules and the obligations should be applied to everyone, which means fair competition. What we cannot accept is the application of different rules and duties to a European producer and an agricultural producer outside the EU. Accepting this means accepting the loss in competitiveness of our agricultural sector and a huge effect on the labour force in Europe. I am in favour of free trade, but under symmetric conditions of production and information. If they do not exist, free trade is not fair trade and competition is not fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not think that Parliament should ratify the EU-Morocco Agreement without the inclusion of clauses concerning the labour market, the social dimension and the environment in Morocco. If this does not happen, we may lose our European farming activity and our food chain industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We warned that if these were concluded, they would further increase the pressure faced by farmers in the EU to lower production prices, especially in countries like Portugal, and exacerbate the additional difficulties in disposing of their products. We condemn the liberalisation of trade in fruit and vegetables, which are typically Mediterranean products, as this would lead to large supermarkets stocking lower priced products, which are often exempt from the same rules and standards as those imposed on farmers in the EU. We would like to point out that the liberalisation of trade for agricultural produce promotes models of intensive production for export which favour big agribusiness at the expense of small and medium-sized farming, family farming, and supply for local and regional markets. All this has negative consequences on the sovereignty, security and quality of food, and on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation was the reason for our warnings, which the Commission has regrettably ignored, and is continuing to do so. It has ignored the need to defend the interests of EU producers, ensuring fair prices for production and business continuity, especially for small and medium-sized farming. Moreover, we now know that the Commission also ignored the report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which denounced irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco, in a report acknowledging the impact of these imports on lowering tomato prices in the EU market. Not content with this, in the new agricultural chapter in the Association Agreement with Morocco, the Commission has decided to further increase tomato imports to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">When will this liberal fundamentalism, which sacrifices everything to the interests of a few major European corporations and multinational exporters, finally be curbed? How does the Commission intend to make amends to European producers for the damage that it has clearly caused them? We will leave you with these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fraud is being committed, and you know it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative.</p>

I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval.

<p class="contents">I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb.</p>

Consumers have a right to be able to buy healthy, fairly produced products throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up the market – in other words, a controlled import quota – must therefore be subject to at least three requirements being met. Firstly, there must be clear control of the quantity of imports permitted. This relates mainly to the quantitative aspect. Secondly, the quality of the products must also be controlled. This also relates to production standards. Thirdly, the impact on farmers in the European Union needs to be taken into consideration. Business that harms third parties – and here, this generally means business that favours industry to the detriment of agriculture – must be prevented.</p>

<p class="contents">Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will use the Comext data for this.</p>
<p class="contents">EU imports of tomatoes from Morocco grew from 185 000 tonnes in the 1999-2000 season to 295 000 tonnes in 2009-2010, following the normal trend of fresh fruit and vegetable imports from all over the world. At the same time, total additional EU imports of tomatoes increased from 242 000 tonnes to 493 000 tonnes. I have to underline that Morocco’s share of total EU imports actually decreased from 76% to 59%. EU tomato production varies between 16 and 18 million tonnes per year, of which 6.5 to 7.5 million tonnes are destined for the fresh market. I think that it is very good to bear these figures in mind so that we can keep this discussion and the size of the problem in proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the new agreement with Morocco, we in the Commission believe that it is modest and balanced. If it is adopted, the Commission will, of course, ensure that all its conditions and rules are fully respected. Additional quantities under the tariff rate quota will be kept below the traditional average of supplies to the EU. The current average annual level is 300 000 tonnes. With an additional 52 000 tonnes, there will be 285 000 tonnes within the tariff rate quota, so there will still be scope for 15 000 tonnes of imports under the usual <span class="italic">erga omnes</span> regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to another problem raised, namely, the claim that we failed to act, I really cannot accept that because we did not find any systemic failure in the system. There was one case that was also presented here today in which OLAF investigated the problem and referred the whole file with the findings to the French court, which did not support the full extent of OLAF’s findings, but nevertheless, the partial recovery of unpaid duties has started.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to assure this House that, regarding control of phytosanitary standards, the Commission is assuring the highest possible control and the highest possible level of standards for every import of fresh fruit and vegetables to the European Union. At the same time, I have to say that I understand the vigilance of the Members of the European Parliament and the vigilance of the agricultural sector on these very pertinent issues. I would like to assure them that, if the organisations have concrete evidence of fraud, they are invited to bring this to the attention of the Commission, which will carefully analyse it and take appropriate action if needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council. However, the inclusion of the correlation tables in the text remains a very sensitive issue. Despite the fact that the Council was totally opposed to it, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to vote for a text that includes the correlation tables, which oblige Member States to report on transposition of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the Council to decide whether to accept the correlation tables and conclude the agreement at first reading, or to answer to European farmers for causing the bluetongue vaccination campaign to be missed this year in order not to give way on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report can act as a precedent in future negotiations with the Council. We must be united and determined in calling for maximum transparency from Member States and in defending total compliance with EU law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragedy of Fukushima underlines the huge danger that nuclear power represents for humanity and for the environment. The potential for massive catastrophe and the lack of a safe way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel means that nuclear power does not represent a safe means to develop energy production.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy also underlines the fact that private profiteers cannot be trusted with the vital task of energy production and energy distribution. Ultimately, the capitalist pursuit of profit, without regard for human life, human safety or the environment, is responsible for this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for the nationalisation of the energy sector under democratic worker control and management. On that basis, we could develop a rational and sustainable plan for energy production, distribution and use, to provide cheap and safe energy for all, while protecting the environment. At the centre of that plan, there must be a long-term programme of investment in renewable energy sources leading to the progressive replacement of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I appeal to the governments of these countries to stop the repression, in the name of human rights, including the right to peaceful protest and freedom of speech. I call on European institutions and the relevant international organisations to set in motion diplomatic measures in order to protect the demonstrators. I hope that, in adopting today’s resolution, we will also contribute to the protection of fundamental human rights in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights are one key area; they must be exported to the Middle East. We really need to present a concept and understanding of what human rights mean. That is not easy, because Middle Eastern culture is based on different values. We in Europe have been brought up in a world of Judaeo-Christian values, whilst theirs come from Islamic thinking. In both, people are treated differently, and the notion of a human being is different.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Syria has been under emergency law since 1963. This has allowed the execution of people without trial. Now, this uprising shows us that in Europe, we really need to open our eyes and see that the only success story in the Middle East is its sole democratic state: Israel, where there are human rights, freedom of opinion and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now exert more of this type of influence on Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, so that they might accept human rights for all and, furthermore, the rights of women and children, thereby, perhaps, taking the path to democracy. I am not naïve, however, and I know that in the Islamic world, it is difficult to take these values forward. Nevertheless, as Europeans, we should try to export and promote them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of the financial and economic crisis, Iceland went from being the fifth richest country in the world to being a country racked by crisis, with the collapse of its banking system, where 40% of households could not pay their bills and pensioners lost their life’s savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, 93% of the Icelandic population, in a referendum, rejected the notion of paying more than EUR 3.5 billion to the governments of Britain and the Netherlands. Despite some modifications, they are faced with essentially the same deal in the vote to be held on 9 April. They should not be bullied into accepting this deal; the deal should be rejected. It is not the responsibility of the Icelandic people to pay for the crisis. Workers, pensioners and poor people have not created this crisis and must not pay for it; not in Iceland, not in Greece, not in Portugal, not in Spain, not in Ireland nor elsewhere. Those international speculators who profited massively from the deregulation of the financial markets must pay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot tell people and ethnic groups in other countries to rename their language because other countries do not like what they call it.

<p class="contents">I was consequently very annoyed that unfortunately, one amendment was passed that I voted against, which stated that Macedonian should not be allowed to be called Macedonian. Macedonia is a country with great prospects in Europe mainly because it also has great economic prospects in the Balkans, a region that has genuine difficulties, is prospering economically, and is conducting the negotiations with élan – which is very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this positive attitude, I would like to thank all the Members who voted for this resolution, as well as all those who worked with the parliament there as part of the European Parliament delegation.

Intimidation of the local population and of foreign observers cannot be allowed to happen. The results of democratic elections must be complied with in full.

Further expansion will take place in this direction. Therefore, it is essential to increase expenditure in order to develop the democratic structures of these countries. Support for initiatives such as Bielsat have a not inconsiderable significance for the independence of the media in Belarus, at the same time as withdrawing assistance for the state-controlled media. I would call for active support to be given to local democratic authorities in these countries through partnership programmes. Association agreements remain an important tool in stimulating reform, and the more funding and technical support they can provide, the better their results. Widening the intellectual base through scholarship programmes also requires additional funds. I appeal for an increase in funding to support human rights and the development of civil societies.

Although there is no record of any human being infected, it is vital to recognise this disease and seek to implement measures that will eradicate it. At EU level, this disease was first seen in the south, and then in the centre and north of Europe. Thanks to successive vaccination campaigns cofinanced by the EU, the use of certain vaccines may not eradicate the disease, but allow it to continue to circulate. A type of vaccine was therefore developed that ensures the control and prevention of this disease in the EU, but the use of which is restricted under current rules. A change to the current directive is therefore needed. Given that this proposal for an amendment to the Parliament and Council Directive 2000/75/EC complies with the Animal Health strategy (2007-2013) and points towards a more flexible approach in the vaccination system, thereby contributing to improved control of major animal diseases, I am voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the early 2000s, several epidemic waves of disease have occurred in many Member States, including central and northern Europe, causing significant losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and disruption of trade in live animals. Hitherto, the provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue have been based on experience of the use of live attenuated vaccines that were the only vaccines available. Those vaccines may lead to undesired circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals. In the last few years, however, new inactivated vaccines have become available. Unlike the ‘live attenuated vaccines’, these inactivated vaccines do not pose the risk of undesired vaccine virus circulation and can therefore be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions. This proposal would relax some restrictions, which have become unnecessary in light of the recent developments in vaccine production. The new rules would help Member States to make more effective use of vaccination to control bluetongue and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic damage and the losses resulting from the trade coming to a standstill are hitting the farming sector hard. In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers have found their livelihoods threatened. It is now important to implement supporting measures and revise the old regulation before the next epidemic breaks out. The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers. I welcome the rapid action at EU level and advocate the fast implementation of the new directive. As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle. Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of those that keep animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the early 2000s, it has caused significant losses of animals affected by the disease. Europe intervened with Council Directive 2000/75/EC to deal with the problem through provisions regulating the use of ‘attenuated vaccines’, in order to effectively combat the consequences of the phenomenon. The vaccines used hitherto, which were those to which the aforementioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to unvaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zones. Unlike the ones on the market at the time Council Directive 2000/75/EC was introduced, the new vaccines available are ‘inactivated vaccines’, and do not pose this kind of risk. I voted in favour of this report because the new provisions will allow Member States to control the phenomenon, thus reducing the negative impact of this disease on a large number of European livestock farmers.

One of these is bluetongue, of which there have been repeated epidemics in Northern Europe since 2000 and which can cause particularly great damage. Cattle and sheep are particularly badly affected by the disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted by the gnat, a type of midge. An illness has also been observed in goats, but the course of the disease is far less dramatic in these than in the case of other species. The possibility of vaccination was first permitted in 2000, but was subject to strict rules since untreated animals could also have been infected by the viruses through the vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">However, now there is a new vaccination method that does not pose this risk, allowing more flexible forms of vaccination to be carried out. I voted in favour of the report because I consider it right and proper to protect our livestock from epidemic diseases. The flexibility called for will allow farmers to protect their animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. Since the early 2000s, several epidemic waves of disease have occurred in many Member States, including in central and northern Europe, causing significant losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and disruption of trade in live animals. Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 lays down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, including rules on vaccination. These rules were designed for the use of ‘live attenuated vaccines’ that were the only vaccines available when the directive was adopted a decade ago. Those vaccines may lead to undesired circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals. For this reason, Directive 2000/75/EC allows vaccination only in specially designated zones in which the disease has occurred and which have been subject to animal movement restrictions. In the last few years, however, new inactivated vaccines have become available. Unlike the ‘live attenuated vaccines’, these inactivated vaccines do not pose the risk of undesired vaccine virus circulation and could therefore be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new law ushers in the use of a new bluetongue vaccine for the first time, which takes advantage of developments in science since the previous rules came into force. The new vaccine will be an ‘inactivated’ jab and will allay farmers’ fears over the traditional ‘live’ vaccines. The EPLP is delighted that the EU has brought in this new law, which has real benefits for farmers in the UK. It reassures farmers who are concerned by the deadly disease and the existing vaccination as the bluetongue season approaches with the warmer weather. Farmers will now have a new and safer vaccine available and will be given greater powers over their own vaccination programmes. Until now, farmers would have lost the right to vaccinate their animals if the UK was declared entirely free from bluetongue. But under the new law, farmers are given the power to keep vaccinating for their own peace of mind, whilst profiting from easier exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial that 1. the stress tests are carried out by independent experts and that 2. the results of those tests are acted on rigorously. That means that nuclear installations which do not conform to the standards, which continue to fail to make the grade, should be closed down. Obviously, power plants elsewhere in Europe, outside of the EU, should be subject to the same independent testing, under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Any state which refuses to participate in this will be making itself an international pariah, even in terms of international trade. Nuclear power has been, and remains, a transitional technology, a technology which we will, unfortunately, have to hang onto for decades to come. We will even have to make new investments in order to meet our energy needs and, at the same time, consolidate our climate ambitions. During that time, we must do everything possible to reduce the risk of accidents to a level that borders on zero. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the initial good intentions of a joint resolution were quickly smashed to pieces: since each parliamentary group took a position for or against, it became impossible, in the end, to vote for this draft, which has no political message. Let us be clear: I had come to expect much more of the European Parliament.

The leaders of the country have described the destructive earthquake, combined with the giant tsunami waves and the subsequent nuclear threat, as the worst crisis since the US military dropped the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nature has wrought enormous and irreplaceable losses, especially in terms of human life and property. However, the situation in the Fukushima nuclear plant remains a threat. In an attempt to avert similar threats in the future, it would be right to consider implementing so-called stress tests of nuclear plants in EU Member States. These should show the extent to which the power plants are capable of withstanding similar disasters. A similar situation to the one in Japan could happen anywhere in Europe. It is therefore also desirable to have more stringent monitoring of safety systems at nuclear power plants, strengthening their weak aspects and eliminating any deficiencies. It is in the interest of individual countries, and also within their capabilities, to look for a solution to the nuclear issue – whether through safety improvements, or complete decommissioning. Cooperation at the European level, however, is essential. Although Europe is not threatened by giant tsunami waves, there is the threat in the 21st century of, for example, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer hackers on nuclear power plant systems and so on. From a security perspective, the extent to which power plants can counter such potential threats is very much open to question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, it does not indicate any way out of a completely new situation for energy policy as a whole. For example, points 19, 20 and 21 could have introduced new ideas and orientations in terms of integrated thinking about energy efficiency, especially efficiency with regard to energy from primary sources, of which we have the greatest reserves, especially fossil fuels. Thirdly, the radical suggestions it contains require a national referendum, which, in my country, is to take place at the initiative of the left-wing parties. Maybe such a referendum ought to be carried out at EU level. Fourthly, my country, as a result of the EU’s misguided regulations to date, has been forced to halt essential investments in coal power stations, and now the same lobby is saying that we need to halt investments in nuclear technology. So what is left? The resolution points only to energy from renewable sources. In my country, the total capacity of these resources would cover 13%, to a maximum of 20%, of essential needs. Maybe in Sweden the situation is different, as it has large reserves of hydropower, but not in Poland.

There is no such thing as zero risk in life full stop. We must do all we can to minimise that risk. For the moment, however, we do not have any credible alternatives. Forcing the Member States urgently to abandon that energy source, to stop building new plants and to shut the others, is completely at odds with the outright rejection of fossil energy, on the pretext that its use would contribute to global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear energy or fossil energy: you may favour one over the other, but you cannot rule them both out. Neither hydropower nor today’s alternative energy sources are capable of meeting our supply needs. Those countries that have stopped using nuclear power – but not preaching to the others – are, in fact, very happy that their neighbours, from whom they obtain their supplies, have not made the same choice as them!

Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution.

Following the nuclear accident in Japan, thousands of people died and disappeared without trace. Significant material damage has also been done and the consequences will have long-term implications for people’s health. Even now, we still feel the consequences of Chernobyl, and therefore today, we must reassess our approach to nuclear safety in the EU and the rest of the world. As for improving nuclear projects, in Belarus and Kaliningrad, there are huge problems surrounding nuclear safety standards, and compliance with the appropriate obligations in international conventions, because these problems are not just a matter for the Member States that share borders with these regions, but for the whole of Europe, and EU entities and the European Commission must act together, under the subsidiarity principle. The resolution on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy states that given the planned development of nuclear energy in the Baltic Sea region, the EU Member States must comply with the most stringent standards of safety and environmental protection, and the European Commission must monitor and check whether neighbouring countries on the EU’s external borders follow the same approach and international conventions. Nuclear power plants under construction near the EU’s external borders must comply with international nuclear safety and environmental protection standards. Today, energy efficiency and energy saving, renewable and sustainable energy, and the introduction of Europe-wide electrical energy networks, have become particularly important.

The events that have taken place show that, in order to prevent disasters on this scale, Europe has to implement a series of very stringent measures in order to assess existing safety levels.

I voted against this resolution, because apart from the bans and the moratorium on nuclear power development and the suggestion of a gradual withdrawal from nuclear energy (which is unrealistic), it does not add anything positive, and neither does it provide any solutions for the future of the energy industry in general. The situation after the tragedy in Fukushima has completely changed the philosophy of the approach to the future of energy production in Europe and Poland. In our country, the power industry, 95% of which is based on coal, has already suffered as a result of the adoption of the Climate and Energy Package. Investments undertaken in order to build two nuclear power plants have also been stopped. The resolution only stresses the importance of energy generated from renewable sources, which in Poland represents only 13%, and at most 20%, of our needs. Moreover, a referendum on the nuclear power industry, which is being suggested by the Left, is still to be held in Poland, and therefore, the conclusions drawn from this very resolution are premature.

It is important for us to have a clear picture based on precise data about what happened at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. We must not lose sight of the benefits of nuclear energy, which produces low carbon dioxide emissions, incurs relatively lower costs and ensures energy independence. Until now, nuclear energy has been the safest form of energy, statistically speaking, with the lowest number of accident victims, compared to other energy sources (for example, gas and oil). It is also vital to respect the decisions of Member States in terms of determining the composition of their own energy mix. Nuclear energy has an important role to play in achieving the European Union’s targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy and the energy strategy for the current decade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has already provided for stress tests to be carried out on all plants, including those in neighbouring states having existing relations with the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution also provides for a moratorium on the construction of new power stations to allow for proper evaluation of the associated risks. We must be aware that in the decades to come, many countries will still depend on nuclear energy but, at the same time, we cannot allow there to be power plants in Europe that pose a risk to the population. Power stations predating 1980 must be decommissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">In some countries, such as Italy, assessments are being carried out to decide whether or not to abandon nuclear energy, and it is essential to implement common decisions, also, at European level. What is incredible is the fact that the European Parliament has been unable to pronounce on an issue such as the one under consideration today, which is important and of deep concern to citizens. In fact, all the resolutions have been rejected, including the joint resolution, which we endorsed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt. How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations? How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost? Once a power station is shown to be ‘stressed’, how much does it cost to ‘destress’ it? Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste? No one has yet told us.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States. Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power – clean nuclear, or fusion – or even begin to consider an overall energy plan? We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has, for years, advocated the phasing out of nuclear power, because the risks to humans and the environment are unacceptably high and because there are more than enough alternatives. Fukushima, in particular, has demonstrated that. It is sad that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe continue to believe in their nuclear dreams, even if, as has now been made clear by Japan and Chernobyl, they will ultimately end in nightmares.

Nuclear energy is now demonised and there is growing pressure demanding a complete switch from nuclear to so-called alternative sources of energy. But this school of thought is bordering on outright superstition. The nuclear reactor of Fukushima was hit by an unprecedented combination of catastrophes. This proves that nature is unpredictable and that tsunamis cannot be banned, but it does not prove that nuclear energy is at fault. Nuclear energy has a much safer record than any other source of energy. While oil arguably generates exploitation, dependence, wars and dictatorships, nuclear energy is historically much safer. Our main concern with nuclear energy should indeed be risk assessment and unitary safety procedures at a European level. With these criteria fulfilled and observed, nuclear energy could put an end or severely limit the politics of energy dependence. And while natural disasters cannot be prevented, nuclear energy is not a serious risk per se. The real danger does not come from well serviced nuclear reactors, but from nuclear reactors under the wrong political control. In other words, look at Iran, not Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should not, however, lead to closures of existing power plants where there are no safety concerns or prevent the opening of new nuclear installations to replace out-of-date plants.

In this situation, we cannot overlook the religious element in the developments in the region, at a time when the Shi’ite opposition is supported by Iran, while the Sunni dynasty enjoys the support of the monarchies in the area. Moreover, the close ties between Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the religious tensions between the Sunnis and Alawites in Syria, should make us exercise caution because there is a huge risk that the escalation in violence will also push Syria towards civil war, with outside interference. The Hama massacre in 1982, which included 20 000 Syrians among its victims, is a tragic warning in this regard, just as are the failures in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq in terms of the way in which the West must act in a region whose very distinctive features cannot be ignored. I believe that we need more diplomacy and less armed force, more concern for defending human rights and the protection of civilians and less concern for the electoral potential of external intervention, as well as greater attention on the poverty and corruption which these societies are faced with, especially in Yemen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Syria, protests in several cities have been brutally put down despite EU calls for rights of freedom of expression and association to be respected. Finally, in Yemen, the situation is deeply worrying and has already been condemned by the EU because of the repression of demonstrators, to which we cannot be indifferent. I therefore agree with the measures proposed in this resolution, not least the condemnation of those responsible for massacres in these countries, and hope that they have an effect in as short a time as possible so that the humiliation of their people can stop.

The political background in Syria and Yemen has been, for a long time, authoritarian or outright dictatorial. Yet this is not making the opposition a fully democratic alternative. Especially in Yemen, a lawless, fragmented polity, the forces gathering under the opposition umbrella are hosting or could give way to terrorist or radical anti-democratic forces. In the past, ‘stability’ in the foreign policy for the Middle East was a substitute for inaction or the status quo. It was certainly an overrated concept. Now it could become underrated. The European and largely the democratic interest would be better served by a rational, non-emotional approach. The need for democracy in countries with a long record of political oppression should not become the undoing of future democratic process. This does not mean that the Assad or Saleh regimes should be propped up, but it means that the solution should be a negotiated exit strategy rather than a violent and uncontrolled regime change. Caution and clear headed policies are much more appropriate in countries and regions that could turn from one system of oppression to another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must not allow people’s legitimate and peacefully expressed demands to be repressed through the use of violence, which unfortunately appears to be the only response of regimes with their backs against the wall. Europe must express itself firmly, in particular, through the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, so as to confirm its support for the public demonstrations, which are calling for the fundamental values that are promoted and defended by the Union to be respected in those countries. Our Parliament, which is regarded as a temple of democracy, must reiterate its solidarity with these peoples and must support them in their democratic transition process.

The situation is worrying as these countries are the most vulnerable to ordeals such as the financial and food crises and climate change, while also facing extreme poverty, a lack of infrastructure and rising unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">This reality highlights that, unfortunately, the international community has not fulfilled the commitments set out in the Brussels Action Programme. I hope that during the conference, where I will be representing the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we will focus on achieving consistency in terms of development policies and methods for implementing innovative funding mechanisms, with the aim of providing more effective help to those countries which need to be encouraged to implement suitable policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to development policy, the disparity between the EU’s words and actions is clear. We have the resources at our disposal to eradicate poverty. These are even increased by the benefits of scientific and technological development. Nonetheless, what we are seeing is an increase in poverty at global level. This is the result of the system that dominates the world: capitalism, which is intrinsically unfair and unequal.

I welcome the EU’s attempt to participate actively at the top-level UN conference, and I expect concrete commitments from this. During the past 10 years, the poorest countries have recorded greater progress than in the previous decade. Despite this, however, many problems persist: increasing dependence on imported goods, poverty, the low level of human capital and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. These problems must be resolved from all sides, but two points are particularly important. First, these countries have to get investment flowing into the productive sectors of the economy. Secondly, it is necessary to help build democratic structures in these countries, enabling them to decide independently on strategic priorities without foreign interference. Commodity market fluctuations and the consequences arising from these are a specific issue that must be resolved. From the long-term perspective, the answer is to diversify the economy. From the short-term and medium-term perspective, it is important to control price shocks, especially in the area of foodstuffs. With regard to the position of the EU, it is important to focus on coherent external policies. The Commission document of 16 February is exhaustive, but it must take a more critical approach. We need to acknowledge that not all EU activities in the area of trade or direct foreign investments are in line with development policy. In my opinion, they should be subordinated to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This feeble increase is progressively distancing them from the eight Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, following the Third United Nations conference, some positive steps were taken in the area of official development assistance, enabling some 19 countries to achieve a growth rate of 3%. I share the rapporteur’s opinion in emphasising the importance of the Fourth United Nations conference. The principal goals must focus on development policy, agriculture and fisheries, and must seek to obtain concrete results and innovative financing. I hope that the contribution to sustainable development will also translate into support for health, education and the promotion of democracy, and hold fast to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as essential components of the European Union’s development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The category of LDC was created by the UN General Assembly in the early 1970s, which was more than 40 years ago. Since then, the number of LDCs has increased twofold, and only three (Botswana, Maldives and Cape Verde) have been able to graduate from the group. This shows that poverty is spreading, and the effectiveness of activities undertaken so far is barely perceptible. The critical situation has been exacerbated further by the economic crisis. Its effects have affected LDCs to a large extent and caused a further deepening of the problems occurring there. These arise, in particular, from debt, high food and fuel prices and climate change. I therefore supported the resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on LDCs with full conviction and awareness of its importance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for a deep, comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of the situation of LDCs and concrete proposals for solutions aimed at improving the living conditions of the citizens of these countries in the short term, and at leaving the group in the long term. As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I would like to draw particular attention to the lack of control mechanisms for work which has been undertaken. We do not lack the political will and willingness to help, but unfortunately, we do not monitor our efforts adequately, and the result is that they are not very effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increase in the number of states falling into that category (since 1971, the number of LDCs has risen from 25 to 48) requires the international community to redouble its efforts to meet the objective of halving the number of LDCs by 2020. From this point of view, it is essential to ensure true policy coherence between policies directly affecting the LDCs, such as development aid, trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance, in order to reduce poverty and guarantee decent incomes and livelihoods for the inhabitants of the LDCs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that in the EU’s relations with the least developed countries, policy in all areas – including trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance – must be designed in such a way as to support their development needs. Furthermore, the resolution recalls the importance of reaching the ODA target of 0.15 to 0.20% of GNI for the LDCs, and warns of the adverse impact of farmland acquisition, such as the expropriation of small farmers and the unsustainable use of land and water. The principle of coherence is designed to prevent statements of good intentions that are never translated into action, and conflicting sectoral policies.

An inexorable gap is opening up between the least developed countries and the world economy, creating a vicious circle in which the victims are the populations. We are all responsible for the delays in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which makes coordinated action by the EU and the UN a matter of urgency. The priority areas are well known: food security, access to water and healthcare, and literacy. The solutions are also well known, but I regret that the statements of good intentions are rarely translated into action. And yet it is by working towards a better distribution of wealth, supporting LDCs on the path to growth and democracy, and combating the frenzied speculation on commodity prices, that these extremely vulnerable countries will be able to escape the vicious circle of poverty. This is not only a responsibility; it is a security requirement for the Union, because poverty is unfortunately often a source of instability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the necessary conditions need to be created for completing Iceland’s accession process and ensuring the success of this accession: this is a country with a strong democratic tradition and a robust civic culture, and its accession will strengthen the Union’s role in promoting the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. Iceland belongs to the European Free Trade Association, and has a market economy that could provide certain advantages to the EU, specifically in the area of renewable energy. Nonetheless, Iceland needs to provide evidence of real interest, and to cooperate on the resolution of outstanding issues in the fisheries management sector. According to the report that has been tabled, some progress has been made, but there is still a long way to go, particularly with regard to the fisheries sector. I hope that these outstanding issues can be quickly resolved, so that Iceland’s accession process is a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iceland can bring a valuable contribution to EU policies due to its experience in the field of renewable energies, particularly as regards the utilisation of geothermal energy, protection of the environment and measures to deal with climate change. Iceland’s accession to the EU would enhance the Union’s prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in Northern Europe and in the Arctic, contributing to multilateral governance and sustainable policy solutions in the region. It is also crucial to give EU citizens clear and comprehensive fact-based information on the implications of Iceland’s accession. Efforts must be made to that end, and I believe it is equally important to listen to and address citizens’ concerns and questions and to respond to their views and interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the year just gone, Iceland demonstrated its willingness to comply on many fronts with European policy and with the principles that inspire it. Its strong civic and democratic tradition, the progress made in strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and the particular attention paid to the economic aspect, which is increasingly on course to meet the criteria laid down by Europe, make it a country whose accession to the EU can only be considered positively, not least because it would strengthen the Union’s role within the Arctic Council. The safeguarding of human rights, the strengthening of the legislative environment with regard to freedom of expression and access to information, and the high rates of investment in education, research and development, aimed at tackling the high level of youth unemployment, demonstrate the industriousness of the country and its firm desire to align itself with Europe. It will be up to the people of Iceland to have the final say: they will have to vote in a referendum, and I hope that they will opt in favour of joining our great European family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lack of dialogue between the government and opposition parties in the country is preventing an agreement on the implementation of structural reforms from being reached.

<p class="contents">The dispute about the former Yugoslav Republic’s name plays a key role in the discussions on the accession negotiations, as it is one of the obstacles preventing the negotiations from starting. Good neighbourly relations are essential during the process of transition to EU Member State status. This is why the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece must find a solution to the issue about what to call the state. So far, Greece has proved itself to be a trustworthy discussion partner with regard to the other chapters. It is high time for both states to reach an agreement so that the future accession negotiations are conducted with the support of all EU Member States. In this regard, the call for neutral external mediators may be helpful, such as the involvement of the UN Secretary-General in the dispute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to call upon the government to rapidly implement more effective measures to improve public investment focused on employment policies and the use of the workforce in good quality, stable and decent jobs. I am, however, pleased with the recent adoption of the Energy Act, which is aimed at liberalising the country’s electricity market and is in accordance with the relevant European directives. I welcome the adoption of the national strategy for sustainable development, but more efforts need to be made towards enforcing legislation in the environmental field, and there needs to be adequate funding set aside for this purpose.

The current political situation, which includes the boycott of the national parliament by opposition parties, may adversely affect the country’s priorities with regard to the EU.

Macedonia has made significant progress in the democratisation of the state, due directly to the political will to become a full member of the family of European nations. The European Commission has evaluated this progress and, for the second year running now, has called upon the European Council to open accession negotiations with Macedonia. Also for the second year running, the Council has not taken this decision. This gives rise to the impression that one of the unfounded obstacles to the opening of these negotiations are mutual bones of contention, including relations with Greece. These disputes must not block the accession process for Macedonia, all the more so since continuing the accession process would promote stability and strengthen yet further the dialogue between the ethnic communities in Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Macedonia has a great deal to do yet in order to reform governmental and judicial institutions, successfully combat organised crime and corruption, and develop democratic dialogues in society. Of course, the acceptance of any new Member State, Macedonia included, into the EU will only take place when all the requirements have been satisfied, and only with the unambiguous agreement of the EU institutions and EU Member States. That is precisely why it is important to begin the accession negotiation process, which, I am convinced, will encourage positive changes in Macedonia and the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I applaud the efforts made by that country to align itself with European standards. Judicial reform, the fight against corruption, and public administration and prison reform are some of the important achievements as regards compliance with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Equally worthy of praise is the focus on granting local autonomy and adopting an anti-discrimination law, as well as on making a commitment to gender equality. Freedom of expression and the independence of the media continue to be a problem, however. Moreover, the growing tensions between different ethnic groups in the country are a cause for concern. I therefore believe that, despite the positive results, attention must continue to be paid to the institutional question, which is very fragile and is being put to the test. I hope, in conclusion, that the process of rapprochement with Europe will be strengthened by means of action aimed at filling the gaps that still exist today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The name issue existing between Macedonia and Greece is exclusively a bilateral issue that should not interfere with the opening of accession negotiations. Moreover, under the 13 September 1995 Interim Accord between Greece and Macedonia, Greece agreed not to object to the application of Macedonia to international institutions, this covering also the EU-Macedonia negotiations process.

According to UN sources, hundreds of lives have been lost in Côte d’Ivoire since December 2010 and the actual number of casualties is likely to be much higher, as the violence taking place in the interior of the country is not always reported in the press. Attacks are being intentionally directed against UN peacekeepers and institutions. I agree with the need for swift international political action to address the humanitarian situation in Côte d’Ivoire and prevent a new migration crisis in the region. The Commission and the Member States must coordinate their efforts with other international donors in order to respond to the urgent needs of the population of Côte d’Ivoire and its neighbouring countries. I support the sanctions, comprising a visa ban and an asset freeze, imposed by the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Council of the European Union on all persons and entities that oppose the legitimate President’s authority, and the fact that these sanctions are to remain in place until the return of legitimate authorities to power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have recently seen an upsurge in violence and verified massacres in Côte d’Ivoire, where the process of democratisation is not being accepted by all Ivorians. Parliament has adopted several resolutions on the political situation in this country, especially on 16 December 2010. Other EU and international institutions, such as the UN Security Council and the Authority of Heads of States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have condemned the violation of human rights in this country following the non-acceptance of the election results, which were certified by the UN, by the deposed President, Mr Gbagbo, which has led to a wave of violence in the country, resulting in hundreds of deaths and about a million refugees. I therefore agree with the measures presented here and am voting in favour of this proposal, as I believe that Parliament should advocate a foreign policy based on values, and not solely on economic interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, this mass influx of refugees could reignite the obvious tensions in that region. This crisis is therefore liable to continue.

Ending the conflict by diplomatic means would have been preferable, but the level of violence reached in Abidjan and the hard-line, self-destructive attitude of the deposed President demanded UN intervention in order to protect the civilians and to help the legitimate President, Alassane Ouattara, assume power. This resolution therefore supports the intervention of French forces under UN control, which helps to enforce the law and the election result, and to protect the lives of civilians and European nationals. When the rule of law has been re-established, the legitimate Ivorian authorities, with the support of the international community, will have to ensure that the losing candidate in Côte d’Ivoire’s recent presidential elections, Laurent Gbagbo, together with all the officials suspected of human rights violations, are tried for their actions. Lastly, I believe the EU must continue to honour its commitment to provide long-term support to Côte d’Ivoire in order to aid national reconciliation and to help rebuild and stabilise the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Besides what I have already said about the resolution on the Southern Dimension, for which I was the rapporteur, I would like to stress the need for both ENP dimensions to favour a ‘bottom-up’ approach in the future, and to emphasise that only greater involvement by local communities and civil society will ensure maximum effectiveness in the implementation of the ENP by the EU. I also hope that the EU will not favour short-term stability at the expense of the best interests and constant defence of the public, and their individual and collective freedom, with a particular focus on women’s rights, as I stated in my speech. Although I am immensely pleased with the results obtained in these two reports, I do rather regret the fact that Parliament and the Commission have not made the most of this opportunity, for once, to differentiate the countries of the ENP to the east from the countries that will potentially become our EU southern ENP partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that significant administrative capacity is required to be able to tackle such diverse problems. Apart from the demographic challenges, climate change, economic competitiveness and quality of life, the regions which share borders with non-Member States have to deal with a series of consequences resulting from problems which are not being resolved properly. This is the case with the way in which natural disasters are managed, for instance. Interventions in emergency situations are extremely difficult if the neighbouring countries do not have the capacity to respond, and no region can respond to the whole situation on its own. This is why I have proposed that the regions located at the EU border, which have borders with at least two non-EU states, should be regarded as ‘platform’ regions and supported accordingly. The neighbourhood policy needs to take into account the capacity of the regions located within the EU, but which have external borders, to tackle the problems which are much more complex. Commensurate financial support must be provided for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Challenges still remain, however, and the focus should now be on the priorities for action, with more effective benchmarks, in particular, as regards the Eastern Partnership. The partnership with our Eastern neighbours represents a political framework of great importance for Europe’s wellbeing, and its work platform is focused on four themes: democracy, good governance, economic integration and convergence with European policies. Unfortunately, at this time, the conflicts that have arisen in these countries are seriously undermining their economic, social and political development, and constitute a serious obstacle to cooperation and regional security, as shown by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.

These events have demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing EU involvement in the neighbourhood. The paradigm shift proposed by the European Parliament from ‘stability first’ to ‘democratisation and human rights first’ in EU policy is necessary. There should be no more pretending that the political status quo, i.e. maintaining authoritarian regimes, is better for Europe and its security. The time has come for solidarity with our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the differences, most countries in the neighbourhood share common characteristics: limited freedom, or no freedom at all, and a lack of success in modernisation. The allocation of additional, generous funds in order to build a stable EU neighbourhood seems unavoidable. The ENP should therefore continue to be founded on the principle of conditionality, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and should be extended by the pursuit of institutional integration, liberalisation of the visa regime, opening up the European market and support for civil society. It is worth recalling again the position of Poland, the advocate of the EU’s successive enlargements, which urged the Member States two years ago, in partnership with Sweden, to strengthen the Eastern Dimension of the ENP in the form of the Eastern Partnership initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of current events, Poland’s role takes on a symbolic meaning. Poland, which has historical experience in transformation of its political-economic system, may serve as a good guide and model for both eastern and southern EU neighbours in the current policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has shown that Europe can be proactive if it wants to be, and that it can remain united around an ideal. We have proven this once again today. I am pleased to see this, in a resolution for which I had the honour of being the rapporteur. Indeed, I was pleased to notice that Commissioner Füle welcomed almost all of our proposals, as the whole Chamber could see during the debate which preceded this vote. I now challenge the Commission to demonstrate the ambition that this moment demands in its review process on 10 May, with a neighbourhood policy that is tailor-made to each state, with clear benchmarks and careful consideration. This will allow a future Mediterranean Economic Area with the new democracies in the south, and I hope that the good atmosphere and cooperation that have marked the work on this subject will lead to the permanent involvement of Parliament in planning and evaluating this policy. I think it is absolutely vital that the EU should favour a bottom-up approach in the future for its neighbourhood policy, for the reasons outlined in this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are currently facing a refugee crisis in the area and many regimes are turning on their own people. There is no doubt in my mind that we will soon be asked to approve further funding. Without clear objectives and a programme of work, this muddled policy will continue to fail the most vulnerable in the region.

The EU’s goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods. In these circumstances, the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth. Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end, particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy. However, the review of the ENP now has a greater importance in the context of the events in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The EU should draw lessons from the events in the south, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, and revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clauses in all agreements with third countries. The revision of the ENP should give priority to criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary, respect for basic freedoms, pluralism and freedom of the press, and the fight against corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe’s new strategy must be based on a redefinition of the resources available for the Mediterranean, provide for an increase in financial commitments to facilitate political, economic and social reform in the countries of the region, and press for resources relating to immigration. Moreover, as regards the radical changes affecting our southern neighbours, I believe that the moment has come to adopt a new European approach with the aim not only of defending democracy but also of taking concrete measures to alleviate migratory pressures and to guarantee the security of energy supply. In this context, it is essential to lay the foundations, as soon as possible, for a new and strengthened partnership with our neighbouring countries to the south: a partnership aimed at promoting the stability, economic development and democratic transition of the area. With this in mind, I believe that the European Union must play a key role in the geopolitical context of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These resolutions are particularly important given the recent course of events in the southern region. In particular, we must take into account the strong demands from the public in several southern neighbours of the EU for the overthrow of dictatorships and for pursuing democracy. The strategic review of the European Neighbourhood Policy must fully take these events into account and reflect on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Both resolutions, in relation both to the Southern and Eastern Dimensions, are important for mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and its various neighbouring countries in order to ensure the necessary developments in relation to democracy, human rights and also the economy and security. Europe’s stability and wellbeing are closely tied to the success of the ENP’s southern neighbours in democratic governance as well as their economic and social success, and it is therefore important to support the principles of political debate, full liberties, democratic reforms and the rule of law in the partner countries of the neighbourhood policy.

Several options are already open to us when it comes to providing long-term support for the democratic transition, economic development and regional integration of our southern neighbours. The EU has two tools at its disposal: the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument. Both have shown their weaknesses, but a genuine political commitment could rectify our mistakes. I therefore support this resolution, which provides a clear framework and specific objectives for the next European Neighbourhood Policy. I would, however, draw my fellow Members’ attention to the cross-border dimension of this policy. Accounting as it does for a mere 5% of the ENPI’s total budget, it is overlooked by central government and its programming is subject to alarming delays. However, this dimension may act as a catalyst for many structural initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean. Establishing a genuine EU-Mediterranean partnership means not only taking the aspirations of the peoples into greater account, but also providing real investment in concrete projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the position of a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights, I would like to draw particular attention to the importance of gender equality policies as an inseparable element of human rights, which is also a fundamental principle of the European Union. Women’s rights must be a priority item in talks with the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP).</p>
<p class="contents">According to the resolution, women’s rights should be included in revisions of codified law (constitutional law, criminal law, family law and all bodies of civil law), and should be included in the dialogue on human rights conducted with the ENP partner countries. We should also focus on measures which will deepen the social integration of women. We need programmes that promote the education of women, and we need to promote their employment and increase their participation in public life. The effects of measures to improve gender equality in the ENP countries should be continuously monitored and supervised, and failures in this area should be categorically condemned, and even punished.</p>
<p class="contents">I opt for not strengthening the EU’s relations with those third countries that do not sufficiently incorporate women into their policies and institutions in matters related to the organisation of civil society (in particular, human rights organisations and women’s organisations). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness based on EU values should continue to be the basis for relations with ENP partner countries – in this particular case, with the Mediterranean countries. In the first place, I believe that it is essential to review the indicative programmes for 2011-2013, taking into account the most urgent needs and, at the same time, making the financial instruments, in particular, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the European initiative for democracy and human rights (EIDHR), more flexible in order to provide direct support to civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to call for the Union for the Mediterranean to be strengthened both in terms of funding and in terms of commitment by the Member States, as a favoured forum for the exchange of best practice, where a clear Mediterranean policy should be established, based on partnership policy, the principle of ‘ownership’ and conditionality. Lastly, I believe that solutions urgently need to be found to bring an end to the war in Libya, and also to prepare a package of measures for rebuilding the country after the conflict has ended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU, and Parliament in particular, should be a bastion of protection for fundamental rights and human dignity, and clearly and unequivocally denounce all violations of these values. I strongly condemn the practice of violence against women, and also children, in the recent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, and I would like to call for the most appropriate measures to be taken to protect their most fundamental rights and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of this, the use of sexual violence in any conflict has given rise to the strongest renunciation and condemnation by these organisations. Indeed, many resolutions have been adopted by Parliament denouncing violence against women. This joint motion for a resolution focuses on this violence, in particular, sexual violence, perpetrated against women in North Africa and the Middle East. The reports of violence in the context of war and repression that have reached us are utterly gruesome and have caused great disgust and indignation. The perpetrators of such behaviour cannot go unpunished, even when protected by dictators or under the pretext of backward mentalities. I am therefore voting in favour of this report, which condemns any kind of violence against women in any region, calls for severe penalties for the perpetrators, and establishes EU support for the process of empowering women as a priority, especially those who have had the courage to participate in the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and encouraging their full participation in civic life in the countries where they live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must denounce the use of sexual violence as an instrument for intimidating and humiliating women, without forgetting that the power vacuum that has now emerged could lead to a deterioration in their rights. One significant case is that of a Libyan woman who, in March, told some journalists in a Tripoli hotel that she had been a victim of gang rape by soldiers. Today, that young woman has been sued for defamation by the same men who raped her. We must act by strongly denouncing the disproportionate impact of armed conflicts on women and enhancing their peace building role.

Mass sexual violence against women is a permanent part of armed conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) gives, among others, the example of Kenya, a relatively stable country, in which pre-election riots led to a doubling of the number of victims of sexual violence in a matter of days.</p>
<p class="contents">Sexual violence is becoming an epidemic. In fact, it has become one of the tactics of war. The European Union must not remain neutral on this issue. It is therefore essential to include gender mainstreaming in the mainstream of European Neighbourhood Policy and in the centre of our efforts towards creating an effective and structured approach to gender equality in the countries covered by the policy. Human rights, an inseparable element of which is the equality of men and women, should constitute an essential element of democratic processes in third countries. It is shocking that despite the prevalence of sexual violence in Africa, governments do not include fighting it among their priorities, as we can see, for example, in the case of South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should focus its efforts specifically on women. The proposals included in the resolution for the enhanced social integration of women, the promotion of their employment, the fight against illiteracy among women and traditional harmful practices are very important.

The European Investment Bank plays a critical role in supporting SMEs, particularly during this financial crisis and economic downturn. Given the huge importance of SMEs to the European economy, it was agreed that from 2008 to 2011, SMEs should receive loans totalling over EUR 30 billion. The European Progress Microfinance Facility was set up in March 2010 with some EUR 200 million in funding from the Commission and the Bank. However, SMEs still face difficulties trying to obtain credit. As stated in the Bank Watch report, SMEs, particularly those in Central and Eastern European Member States, are unable to take advantage of the assistance intended for them. The EIB must lay down clear financing conditions and more strict lending effectiveness criteria for its financial intermediaries providing loans. National financial intermediaries were given a period of two years to provide loans, but as the report states, some financial intermediaries granted only a small portion of the loans or did not grant any at all, although the financial resources were in their accounts. Furthermore, the EIB’s website still lacks publicly available data regarding the use and beneficiaries of allocated funding. I believe that the EIB must enhance transparency in its lending through financial intermediaries and report annually on its lending to SMEs, including an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness of this and lists of loan beneficiaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that the commitment to the idea of project bonds, which is aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves, and where these bonds are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures, is a positive step. At this point, it is desirable that both the Commission and the EIB should submit concrete proposals for project bonds. It is also worth highlighting the important work that the EIB may carry out under the EU 2020 strategy, by simplifying procedures and maximising multiplier factors in order to attract public and private sector investors. With regard to EIB financing outside the EU, I believe that a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the EIB, the EBRD and the Commission is desirable, so as to strengthen cooperation in all the countries where they operate, with the dual aim of making their lending policies both consistent with one another and consistent with the EU’s political objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The submitted report takes a positive view of the fact that the EIB acted correctly in supporting SMEs in the EU during the crisis. It is true that the bank formally committed EUR 30 billion over a four-year period to supporting SMEs. However, the problem is that not all of the money even reached the SMEs. In specific terms, only about half of the funds committed reached SMEs in the V4 region in the first period. The EIB gave banks an inexplicably long period of two years to distribute the funds, and also failed to stipulate any sanctions against banks in the event that this deadline was not met. The banks of Central Europe, hard hit by the crisis, were only too pleased to ‘hold on to’ these funds. What was billed as support for SMEs therefore became, in reality, support for the Central European branches of foreign banks. There is reason enough to think that this was not by accident, but by design.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude briefly – the EIB is also having problems in the area of development. It needs to take on more employees specialised in development. The EIB is currently under-staffed, despite its impact on so-called developing countries. I also agree with the rapporteur that the EIB must make strict changes to its funding via intermediaries, as this may end up in tax havens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EIB is playing a decisive role in fighting the crisis. For me, however, the issues of transparency and measurable results remain doubtful. The EIB’s activity focuses on the three areas where the crisis hit hardest: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), convergence regions and climate action. SMEs play a key role in the recovery of the European economy and the fight against unemployment, and therefore it would be expedient to make it easier for them to access the capital required for developments. In this respect, it would be useful if we could see an assessment of the accessibility and effectiveness of the loans in question every year, which would ensure the transparency of the final purpose of the loans and improve the administrative process. Also in this respect, I believe it is vitally important that the EIB updates and tightens its policy on offshore financial centres.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB plays a very important role in enhancing the European Union’s convergence, and due to the technical aid and cofinancing offered by it, the regions under the convergence objectives are able to use an ever larger proportion of the funds available to them. For this reason, I believe that further increasing this role is practical and to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I suggest that the proposal that transparent regulatory supervision should be introduced in the interests of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation, the precise measurement of its results, and compliance with effective and successful business practice, deserves consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EIB should, moreover, provide more support for the building of the TEN-T network, with the aim of generating a leverage effect for more investment, from both the public and the private sector. In order to achieve this objective, project bonds can act as a complementary investment instrument alongside the budget in the TEN-T fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that this point has been put on the agenda, because the case of Mr Ai Weiwei is quite dramatic, as the latest information we have is that there is certainly no intention on the part of the Chinese authorities to release him. The best thing we can do is to approve the urgent resolution we have agreed together with all the groups so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell you that I have my doubts that this resolution will change anything in the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese authorities. What we are, in fact, doing on human rights with the Chinese is a game. We are talking about human rights, they are saying they will open a dialogue and we think that things have changed. Nothing shall change. That is the reality. We have the Nobel prize-winner who could not attend the meeting in Oslo. We now have Mr Ai Weiwei, who is a well-known artist and was one of the last dissidents who had the possibility to say something.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing we can say is in an urgent resolution in which we deplore what is happening. In any case, I had hoped that we could ask why we should continue to participate in fora that the Chinese Communist Party organises with our political parties. I deplore that there was not enough support from the other groups to come to an agreement on that. We could at least have agreed on a principle of not continuing to participate in fora with the Chinese Communist Party, if Mr Weiwei and other dissidents were not released. For that reason at least, I hoped for the support of all the groups here – with the other amendment the Greens tabled, even if the best part of it was eliminated. Yes, it is true, they tabled a fantastic amendment and then eliminated the best part! OK, it was not their fault, but apparently the fault of others.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by the President)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I may be taking a minute more than I usually do, but for Mr Ai Weiwei, it will take ten years longer, apparently. If we can speak in favour of somebody who may be in gaol for years, one minute longer is not too much, Mr President! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, in about 2000, I was a lecturer in Art History in Lisbon, and there, in an anthology of modern artists, was his enormous chandelier, the size of a room, overturned and broken. It was at once extremely beautiful and somewhat poignant and sad. This image somehow also reflects an image of China: able to show itself as sumptuous, rich, developed, and capable of presenting itself to the world, as in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. It is a sophisticated China, yet one with something seriously broken inside. That something is the will, free speech and the spirit of the Chinese people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have met to discuss the case of the artist Ai Weiwei, and we have asked the Chinese authorities to release him, to let him speak with his lawyer and his wife, and to make any accusations, if there are any which are true, and not charges trumped up on the spot. Above all, we have gathered here to say that this artist’s spirit of creativity, imagination and humour will surely survive much longer than that of his gaolers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know from our debate last month on the Communist regime’s vandalism of the ancient city of Kashgar, China vigorously tries to suppress cultural expression that does not conform to what its Communist rulers deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ai Weiwei is an heir to China’s magnificent and ancient artistic traditions. He has also used his artistic talents to raise awareness of China’s dismal human rights record and dearth of political freedom. Clearly, there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China. How else can the regime explain Mr Ai’s arrest on economic crimes and because he failed to complete the correct departure procedures for travelling to Taiwan. This is plainly a smokescreen. In fact, the real reason was later elucidated by the state-run Global Times newspaper in a menacing editorial, which said that Mr Ai would pay a price for his resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We abhor the Chinese Government’s disgraceful treatment of this distinguished artist. We in this House call for his immediate release, and we express regret, once again, that China goes to such extreme lengths against those who dare speak out for their basic human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is well known, Ai Weiwei was prevented from attending the Nobel Prize award ceremony. His arrest is part of a wider trend in cracking down on human rights activists.

The word ‘jasmine’ has been banned from the Chinese Internet recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s news, which Mr Preda highlighted, is very significant because now, we see how dictators copy from each other and compare notes. We can see that the methods that Russia used against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev have been used by Venezuela and Kazakhstan against businessmen who come too close to political influence, who want to establish opposition parties: they are all punished in the name of economic crimes. Punishment of economic crime is the name they give to political repression. We have to be aware that this has not happened much before in China: this is a turning point that does not bode well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that Members of the European Parliament raise the persecuted activists’ names when they travel to China and when meeting their Chinese counterparts, and that they insist on a prison visit. We know that many of those who are persecuted suffer terrible torture in Chinese prisons, sometimes in what we call ‘black gaols’ which are completely unidentified places.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a reminder to all European Parliament delegations that all of them are entitled and obliged to exercise their duty in respect of human rights when they visit countries. We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All this is happening due to their fear that the revolutionary spirit of the Arab world will infect Chinese society. However, the EU can make a difference. Violations of human rights by the Chinese authorities must be a constant theme in its political dialogue with China, and this dialogue should be rethought to ensure that there are concrete results, in particular, the review of court rulings that have kept human rights activists in gaol.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on the new framework agreement cannot leave aside the issue of human rights, subjugating everything to commercial interests. When pursuing its economic interests, the EU itself has a responsibility to support activists like Ai Weiwei, Liu Xiaobo and Hu Jun, who have fought courageously for urgent political reform in China, against oppression, and for human rights and fundamental freedoms. China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has particular obligations regarding human rights, contained in the UN Charter, and it must be accountable for these not only to its citizens, but also to the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the past few weeks, officials have stepped up their surveillance of critics of the government and many dissidents, activists and human rights lawyers have been either put under house arrest or taken into police custody. As Amnesty International has said, Ai Weiwei’s arrest is an alarming turn of events in the increased incidence of counterblows against dissidents by the Chinese authorities.

His arrest was, without doubt, not just the culmination of a whole wave of arrests of critics, but also a message to all the others that not even international prominence can provide protection from being put back in prison by the Chinese authorities or from even disappearing completely. At the same time, our representations are regularly ignored in the human rights dialogue that the European Union is conducting with the Chinese representatives at all levels – with a friendly smile, but ignored and dismissed nonetheless.</p>

His detention is part of the most severe police crackdown in China in decades. Since 2008, China’s internal security budget has, incredibly, grown larger than its military budget. It now stands at an incredible USD 95 billion. This pays for a massive apparatus of State repression, including over 40 000 policemen whose sole job is to police the Internet for dissent.</p>
<p class="contents">This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa. The regime is right to be afraid. The revolutions there demonstrate that a risen working class and the risen poor are more powerful than even the most brutal repressive methods, the most repressive regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mass struggle is needed, in particular, the creation of independent, democratic mass organisations of the working class.

It is intended to test the strength, the resolve and the credibility of democratic countries. It is an attack on human rights. It is true that there must be dialogue, but precisely for that reason we must make it clear to the People’s Republic of China that further economic cooperation must go hand in hand with further democratisation of their country. We therefore demand the release of Ai Weiwei.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, whenever dictators want to avoid being accused of political trials, they always play the tax evasion or economic crimes card. It was the case in the former GDR, it is the case in Russia, and unfortunately, it is also the case in the People’s Republic of China. That is why I emphatically endorse this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The delegation of the European Union to China and a public statement immediately condemned the increasing use of arbitrary detention against human rights defenders, lawyers and activists in China, and underline the EU’s concerns regarding Ai Weiwei.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we have no information concerning Mr Ai’s whereabouts, and I wish to emphasise today that the EU’s view on arbitrary detention and disappearance is that it constitutes a grave violation of human rights and is unacceptable in all circumstances. We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as the resolution before this House makes clear, the detention of Ai Weiwei is only one among many recent incidents of arbitrary detention and disappearance in China. Several prominent Chinese lawyers who frequently act for defendants in human rights cases are reported to have been arrested by police officials since February and have not been seen since.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns about their treatment are only intensified by the ongoing disappearance of the lawyer Gao Zhisheng who, with the exception of a brief reappearance in April 2010, has now been missing for over two years. The High Representative is worried about reports based on interviews with Mr Gao in April 2010 that during his initial period of disappearance, he was detained incommunicado in a variety of unauthorised places of detention and subjected to improper treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, moreover, reports that in recent weeks, a significant number of bloggers and political activists have either been charged with criminal offences, such as subverting state power, or have been detained without charge.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure this House that the Vice-President/High Representative, Catherine Ashton, is following developments very closely and will raise these issues with the Chinese authorities at the earliest opportunity, and that the EU will also make known its concern to the Chinese authorities at the next round of the EU-China human rights dialogue, for which we have proposed dates in May. Allow me to support the statement by Mrs Meissner that what is really needed is one voice, a unified message, which comes not only from the EU institutions, but from all EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The many attempts of the government in exile or the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetans, to find a sensible solution through negotiation with the Chinese ruling power, have always ended in failure. The Chinese clearly do not regard the Tibetans as partners in a shared state, but as an obstacle preventing them from taking full possession of an occupied territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the Nepalese Government is therefore complicated. On the one hand, it must comply with its international obligations and guarantee universal rights to the Tibetan community, but on the other, it cannot disregard the opinion of its enormous neighbour. The position of the Nepalese Government vis-à-vis the elections to the Tibetan Government in exile clearly tells us who is the real global player in this region. For the Nepalese Government, it is China.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans can make symbolic gestures and declare our reservations regarding the weak Nepalese Government. However, if we really want to bring about a change the position of the Tibetan people, our partner in the dialogue must be the Chinese Government, as it is the political leader in the region, influencing the rules of regional politics. We can, of course, make a declaration to the Nepalese Government, but that will not solve the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no surprise, therefore, that the Nepalese authorities prevented Tibetan refugees living in Nepal from voting for a prime minister and a parliament in exile.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, a similar election plan for last October was disrupted by Nepalese police, undoubtedly in response to pressure from Beijing. The fact that China has sought to interfere with an unofficial election taking place in another sovereign neighbouring state is an indication of its leaders’ contempt for democracy and their paranoia about Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obviously irrelevant to China that time and time again, the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, has stressed that he seeks maximum autonomy for Tibet, not independence. I hope that the High Representative – who is not here today – will raise this episode with China and also with Nepal, whose own nascent democracy is kept afloat partly by EU taxpayers’ money in the form of financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to take this opportunity to salute the courage, fortitude and peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people whose example is an inspiration to us all. Nepal is indeed in a delicate position, geopolitically and geographically speaking, but it should seek inspiration from its democratic neighbour to the south, India, rather than from the repressive dictatorship which exists to its north, namely the PRC. Democracy will, I hope, one day be the norm throughout the whole of Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the justification for the amendments is based on the causal nature of the occupation of Tibet by the People’s Republic of China in the thwarting of the Tibetan elections in Nepal. Although the resolution addressed the issue of the ban on elections for the Tibetan Government in exile in Nepal, it cannot be ripped out of the wider context of the status of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if there were no reference to the Chinese occupation of Tibet, which is the very cause and reason for Beijing putting pressure on the Nepalese Government, it would be like talking about the First World War without mentioning the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.</p>

Between 1939 and 1990, a total of 15 Polish prime ministers and six presidents ruled from political exile. Poles did not give up the pursuit of democracy, and finally the red colour of solidarity was able to combine with the white of the ballot paper to give birth to a new, democratic state in 1989.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, too, has a chance for a new beginning thanks to the constitution, which will come into force on 28 May. It would be a pity if Nepal spoiled this celebration by continuing to limit the rights of the Tibetan minority and got a red card from the international community as a result. I consider preventing the participation of Tibetans from Nepal in the recent elections of the Prime Minister in exile an unacceptable violation of fundamental civil rights. The European Union should use all diplomatic and financial means in order to neutralise the pressure on Nepal by China and, in the long term, to ensure that the Tibetans have the right to vote, associate and demonstrate their views.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as in the case of Poland, where it was not possible to prevent the work of the 21 representatives of government who were in exile, so will the Dalai Lama’s successors, I am convinced, not stop their activities. Nepal and China should bear this in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My experience in Switzerland was the same as that of my fellow Members in other countries: the elections were conducted fairly, in secret and absolutely in accordance with democratic rules. The only exception was in Nepal, where security forces – under pressure from the Chinese Government – prevented tens of thousands of Tibetans from taking part in the elections.

If one thing is certain, it is that Beijing has found a new ally in its harassment of the Tibetan people, and that new ally is Nepal. In reality, though, all this goes far beyond the elections because, for several years now, the Nepalese Government, under pressure from the Chinese authorities, has been placing ever more restrictions on the freedom of expression of Tibetans living in exile on its soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Last June, Kathmandu handed over Tibetan refugees to the Chinese authorities. Preventive arrests and the ban on demonstrations, assembly and even movement, have become a common occurrence for Tibetans living in Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament must therefore stop being hypocritical and not just be indignant but also strongly condemn these acts of repression by Nepal and, more generally, the very many – too many – violations of human rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Moreover, we call on Nepal to stop this harassment and ill-treatment of political refugees, and simply to respect their rights. When we consider Nepal’s history as a host country – something which it has always been for Tibetans until recently – it is ultimately very sad to see what that government is inflicting on political refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the arguments that was always used by those who were critical of Tibetan resistance was that this resistance, focused on the figure of the Dalai Lama, had many non-democratic aspects. Now that the Tibetan resistance is in the process of democratisation, it is extremely unfortunate that Nepal, a country where so many Tibetans live, has prevented the democratic elections from being conducted in a normal way. However, I would also ask you to appreciate one thing: often, our governments are the first to yield to pressure by the Chinese Government to create a reality that agrees with the dreams and wishes of the Chinese leaders. We have to understand that in Nepal, the government probably wanted to do the same thing. Therefore, if we want to put pressure on the Nepalese Government to act differently, we also have to start by putting pressure on our own governments to show that they have some backbone in their discussions with the Chinese authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have enjoyed freedom of economic activity, the right to reside in Nepal and, until recently, also some political space to debate the future of Tibet amongst themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent elections on 20 March were an important event for the community outside Tibet and represent a significant step forward in a long reform process envisaged by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, we note with concern that the Nepalese authorities are tightening their grip on the political activities of Tibetans in Nepal. On 20 March, more than 10 000 of them were effectively stopped from voting by the authorities. This is not the first time this has happened. During an earlier round of voting in Nepal on 3 October last year, the polls were subject to a crack-down by the Nepalese authorities, which seized ballot boxes and closed the Tibetan community’s voting sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, through its delegation in Kathmandu and the embassies of the EU Member States, has been monitoring these developments in close contact with the Tibetan community and the government. The EU takes the view that Tibetan refugees should be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of association in accordance with international human rights standards. This should be done in a way which permits the smooth implementation of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to Nepal’s territory should be maintained, and the gentlemen’s agreement between the government of Nepal and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees should be honoured. New Tibetan arrivals apprehended by the Nepalese authorities <span class="italic">en route </span>to Kathmandu should be transferred to the UNHCR’s care promptly and without hindrance. Pre-1990 Tibetans who are recognised as refugees by the Nepalese Government should be provided with adequate Nepalese registration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ensure this House that the EU will continue to raise this issue with the authorities and continue its monitoring and reporting on future developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is, of course, one of the best known of all leaders, and people all over the world have derived strength and consolation from his ideas about goodness, understanding and pacifism.</p>
<p class="contents">His spiritual role will remain in place, but his political duties will now be transferred to the Prime Minister of Tibet’s government in exile. That, however, will not be without its problems. Owing to growing pressure from the Chinese Government, the 20 000 or so Tibetans living in Nepal have not been allowed to vote. The Nepalese Government has said that the demonstrations by Tibetans go against the ‘One China’ policy and has confirmed that it will not allow ‘anti­Beijing activities’ on its soil. It has therefore imposed a voting ban on Tibetan groups.</p>
<p class="contents">This comes as no surprise, since the Nepalese authorities have been repeatedly guilty of breaching the freedom of expression and human rights of Tibetans in exile. This is despite the fact that Nepal has signed the UN international human rights agreements relating to civil and political rights. </p>
<p class="contents">From its delegation in Kathmandu, the European External Action Service should carefully monitor the political situation in Nepal and, in particular, the treatment of Tibetan refugees, and ensure that their rights are being respected.

A nation with such a rich and unique culture lives under a constant threat from a powerful neighbour. Now that the Dalai Lama has resigned from political leadership in favour of a new generation of democratic leaders, the Tibetans have been faced with an opportunity to strengthen democratic traditions, despite the fact that the Tibetan Government is still forced to operate in exile. However, thousands of Tibetans living in Nepal have been deprived of this right. The pressure from China seems to be very effective, and what have so far been peaceful demonstrations in defence of freedom of expression and fundamental rights may become a situation which is difficult to control, and this will certainly have international repercussions. After all, we can imagine how effectively the Chinese Government will want to deal with those who ‘disturb the peace’ in Tibet. Recent events should remind the world that the rights of the Tibetan people are constantly being violated and that the issue of Tibet is not a closed chapter, because the Tibetans will certainly continue to insist on respect for their independence, and they will do so with ever-increasing clamour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

The reason for this decision was, just like today, serious violations of human rights by the ruling administration.</p>
<p class="contents">New cases of intimidation, arrests and also the uninvestigated disappearance of political rivals of the ruling party confirm to us that Robert Mugabe and his political party know that a fair and transparent political contest would strip them of power and raise the prospect of penalties for terrorising the population and pillaging the wealth of the country over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">We can surely all agree on the adoption of the draft resolution, in the hope that measures initiated by the EU may assist the people of Zimbabwe, who are terrorised by their government, to reverse, with the assistance of civic and opposition leaders, the current difficult situation in the country by means that are as peaceful as possible. For the European Union to accredit an ambassador of Robert Mugabe in this situation would surely be seen as an affront to decent people.

<p class="contents">We have been clear on two points. Firstly, that as long as Robert Mugabe remained in power, protected by a small self-serving element in Zanu-PF and the security forces, pillaging the nation’s wealth for their own enrichment, there was little prospect of real change. Secondly, that it was up to the people of Zimbabwe, with the support of their African neighbours – and here I name South Africa in particular of course – to bring about the necessary change.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe, just maybe, there is at last some movement in the right direction. You know when Mugabe is worried: he starts to panic. His police and militia start attacking anyone they see as opponents. The MDC is supposed to be in a power-sharing coalition, but in the past few days, MDC Ministers and MPs, as well as human rights activists, have been beaten up and arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose Mugabe is increasingly nervous on two counts. He has seen what has happened to his friend and main bankroller, Gaddafi; and just a week ago, on 31 March, the Southern African Development Community, which includes South Africa and all Zimbabwe’s neighbours, at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in Zimbabwe. It has called for an end to that violence and for all elements of the global political agreement to be implemented. It has appointed a team to work out a road map to peaceful, free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, and today, that team is in Harare.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling on European governments and the EU to intensify their engagement to use all their political influence in Southern Africa to help bring about rapid change for the better in Zimbabwe and pave the way for properly monitored elections to be held in an atmosphere free from intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Until there is evidence of real change, the restrictive measures specifically targeting Mugabe and his close allies must remain in place. In this regard, there is no way that the EU should accredit Mugabe’s unilaterally appointed envoy as ambassador. Once the people of Zimbabwe have their freedom restored, and genuine democracy and the rule of law established, I feel sure that the international community, including the EU, stands ready to come forward with generous assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I used to work for a development organisation in Amsterdam and, every now and then, we would bring Zimbabwean human rights activists to the Netherlands, to Europe, in order to give them some breathing space. Not just so they could get to know other activists and swap stories, but also to give them an opportunity to get away from Zimbabwe for a little while.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the people I met at that time was Abel Chikomo, whom we have also mentioned in this resolution. A human rights activist who has never lost his enthusiasm, his motivation, for the cause in all these years. It is because of people like him that we are adopting these kinds of resolutions because, to be honest, I do not think that Mr Mugabe is losing any sleep over this. What these resolutions are about is ensuring that he and his colleagues from the MDC have renewed motivation to continue their work. What could we possibly aim to do with these resolutions other than enforcing sanctions?</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore insist that we tighten the Kimberley Process for the trade in conflict diamonds to such an extent that diamonds from Zimbabwe are prevented from being offered for sale at all, because they are the reason why the government has been violating human rights, oppressing people, using child labour and so forth.

The international community and, in particular, the political players in the region, such as the Southern African Development Community, cannot tolerate the harassment and arbitrary arrests carried out by Zanu-PF and the security forces against civil society activists and members and supporters of the MDC, and they have to demand greater respect for human rights before the elections take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Police raids on offices of human rights organisations, such as the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum and several others, allegedly in searches for subversive material, and the arrests of various NGO workers and members of the MDC itself, along with students and young activists, which have intensified since February, are tactics in an unacceptable campaign of intimidation. Instead of launching a campaign of terror against those who refuse to sign a petition against the restrictive measures imposed by the EU on leaders linked to Mugabe, the leaders of Zanu-PF should pay more attention to the lessons to be drawn from the Arab Spring, and allow truly free elections to take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the three topics we are discussing, this is by far the worst and probably the most recurring, as speakers have said. Robert Mugabe has been strutting the world stage for far too long now and has been behaving in a most dictatorial and brutal fashion towards his own people, and particularly towards opponents within his country.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of national unity, which was set up in 2009 to bring about democracy, is obviously not working, due to his efforts to ensure that it does not. The intimidation, arbitrary arrests and disappearances – which is probably another way of saying summary executions – of opponents, particularly in recent months, is quite unacceptable. Even NGOs have not escaped: their offices have been raided and their staff have been detained, so it is quite obvious that action needs to be taken against this dictator.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Van Orden said, at least the African Union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him, and that gives us here in the European Union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure, firstly, that Mr Mugabe stops the arrests and the executions, and secondly, that the constitution is accepted for the freedom of the Zimbabwean people, which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that Mr Mugabe and his allies have done everything they can to ensure that this agreement does not work. They have used pressure and intimidation in attempts to break the opposition movement, which now has a majority in the lower house of parliament. Just a few minutes ago, it was reported that there have been attacks and violence towards people who had gathered around a memorial where there were MDC militants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the EU does not avert its gaze from what is happening in Zimbabwe, that it does not allow Mr Mugabe to get away with this final trick of appointing an ambassador without going through his country’s constitutional mechanisms, and that it also ensures that the sale of diamonds does not profit Mr Mugabe and his allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Agreements concerning the distribution of power are often problematic. This is due to the fact that generally, they do not reflect the result of a democratic decision of the citizens, but a compromise forced by the situation. This was precisely the case in Zimbabwe. However, agreements on the power sharing can be acceptable and may have a positive impact on society if certain conditions are met. One of them is the improvement of the human rights situation. That is why we are dealing with human rights in this country. For example, it is questionable whether the restrictive measures represent a necessary and effective tool. However, we must not allow people who do not want to sign a petition calling for the abolition of these measures to be beaten and harassed. That is why we defend those who struggle for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, recent developments in Zimbabwe are worrying. The Chairman of the Kimberley Process, Mr Mathieu Yamba from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has decided unilaterally, and without consultation, to allow the marketing of diamonds from Zimbabwe’s Marange mine. This mine, which was debated in the House last year, was seized by President Robert Mugabe and his cronies. Hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing, raping, and even killing, local residents.</p>
<p class="contents">The sale of diamonds from the Marange mine will help Mugabe to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on Zimbabwe and, indeed, enrich his Zanu-PF thugs. I therefore urge the European Union, as a party to the Kimberley Process, to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus-based decision making in the Kimberley Process. More generally, I have long been calling for a similar system, a certification, to cover other natural resources extracted in Africa in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases. I am pleased to be working alongside the London-based, internationally renowned, human rights NGO Global Witness in this endeavour, in which the US Administration is leading the way with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment has reached 90%, average life expectancy is 44 years, and the citizens of this country have no access to basic healthcare services. It is obvious that the political agreement reached two years ago by President Mugabe and Prime Minister Tsvangirai has failed to meet the hopes placed in it and that a new, fully democratic solution is needed. The internal situation in Zimbabwe has not changed in the last six months, but the external situation has. Today, we are debating a country in the context of the ‘Spring of Nations’ in Africa, and although Harare is 6 000 kilometres away from Tunis, the most recent case of Côte d’Ivoire shows that sometimes, democracy knows no barriers at all. The European Parliament therefore urges the government of Zimbabwe to take into account the current international situation and the strong reorientation in domestic politics and, above all, to cease repression of the political opposition, to release its representatives from the prisons and allow them to participate in the elections.</p>

With the prospect of the elections in June, President Mugabe is conducting a campaign of intimidation against his rival candidates. Hundreds of government officials, human rights activists and opponents of the regime have been arrested during the last two months. This situation is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the drafting of a democratic constitution has been postponed for a year by Mugabe. The new fundamental law would have guaranteed that the elections were held in transparent circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that the country’s economic situation is deeply affected. The President supports nationalisation of the mining sector, which is the main economic sector in Zimbabwe. Such a measure is harmful as it is precisely the foreign investments in this sector which have maintained the state’s stability in the wake of the economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Zimbabwe has been unable to move towards democracy. On the contrary, in the past few months, there has been a clear increase in the intimidation of political opponents and the number of arbitrary arrests and disappearances. Efforts to create stability will not bear fruit in a political climate like the present one.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is still a country where you can be abused or tortured for your political opinions. The legislative system, which suppresses free and open journalism, restricts the right to freedom of speech. Journalists are harassed. Everything should be done to support the country’s progress towards genuine democracy and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right and fitting that, in February this year, the European Council decided to extend restrictive measures concerning people and organisations connected with the Mugabe administration and to keep a record of the blacklist. I also think that these should be continued until there is real evidence of genuine change in Zimbabwe. However, the measures should only be targeted at Zimbabwe’s corrupt government and must not be allowed to exacerbate the plight of the Zimbabwean people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every glimpse of hope of some positive development is immediately crushed by outbursts of political repression and violence. This is exactly what happened again just a couple of months ago. The European Union therefore had to proceed to renew its restrictive measures, for the eighth time, in February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">By this clear gesture, we wanted to underline the critical importance of an agreement between the government parties on the necessary steps leading to elections in the country. In this context, the EU emphasised its willingness to revise its decision in response to further concrete developments on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is deeply concerned at the upsurge in political violence seen in recent months in Zimbabwe. On 11 March, together with 21 embassies and representations, the EU issued a statement to express its concerns over the increase in what appears to be politically motivated intimidation and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the EU welcomes the outcome of the recent SADC summit on 31 March 2011. The SADC communiqué calls for an immediate end to violence, intimidation, hate speech and harassment, and calls upon the government of Zimbabwe to complete all necessary steps to hold an election. It offers assistance so that elections can be organised in accordance with SADC principles and guidelines governing democratic elections. For that reason, the SADC will appoint officials to join the South African facilitation team and work with the joint monitoring and implementation committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU believes that strengthened facilitation and mediation efforts by SADC and South Africa are key to preventing further instability in Zimbabwe. The EU welcomes the region’s efforts to mediate in the Zimbabwean crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa, in its capacity as facilitator, together with the SADC, as guarantor of the Global Political Agreement, has decided to accredit the Zimbabwean Ambassador. At this point in time, keeping a formal channel of communication open with Zimbabwe and maintaining a dialogue with the inclusive government is vital, and we should not jeopardise the position of the EU Ambassador in Harare. The EU will act and proceed in close coordination with all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU remains the largest provider of development assistance to Zimbabwe. We want to clearly express that we are tough on the regime, but we try to assist the people. With the disbursement of approximately 365 million since the establishment of the Global Political Agreement in 2009, we are – as I said – the largest donor.</p>
<p class="contents">Resources are only channelled through UN bodies and specialised NGOs. Since 2009, the EU has also supported governance reforms, as stipulated in the Global Political Agreement, including the constitutional reform process. The EU also funds human rights programmes, including programmes from human rights defenders. We just have to hope that all the international pressure will finally lead to free and fair elections in Zimbabwe and to the gradual normalisation of the very difficult situation in this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are core EU values which the EU is consistently promoting in its relations with third countries.</p>
<p>At the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit, which took place in Brussels on 22 November 2010, the leaders recalled that EU-Ukraine relations were based on common values and a common history, and that the EU had acknowledged Ukraine's European aspirations and welcomed its European choice. They also noted that the depth of the EU-Ukraine relationship would be determined by the implementation of reforms and by further consolidation of common values.</p>
<p>The parties discussed the issue of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and the rule of law based on an independent and impartial judiciary. They stressed in particular the importance of a free media. Following the recent local elections, the leaders recalled the need for further strengthening of democratic development in Ukraine, in particular the electoral framework.</p>
<p>The leaders took note of the recent constitutional developments in Ukraine. The EU side encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to undertake constitutional reform in an inclusive and comprehensive manner in close cooperation with the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The leaders expressed their satisfaction at the progress achieved in EU-Ukraine relations. In this regard they stressed the importance of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement which is currently being negotiated and looked forward to the conclusion of negotiations as soon as possible while retaining the quality and viability of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p>The Council is concerned at consistent and wide-spread reports of deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine. Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. The EU will continue to use every opportunity to underline the importance of full respect for rule of law, including in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and notably with regard to the principle of a fair, impartial and independent justice, as well as the need to ensure that the criminal law is not used for political ends.</p>
<p>The EU is also following closely the situation of the rights of persons belonging to minorities in Ukraine and is monitoring developments in Ukraine's progress towards a modern legal framework for ensuring the rights of persons belonging to minorities and towards implementation of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The EU will continue to regularly raise these issues with the Ukrainian authorities as part of its on-going dialogue with Ukraine.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000109"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As in all trade negotiations, through its Trade Policy Committee, the Council is following the developments in the negotiations with Mercosur closely. The Council is focussing particularly on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down in the negotiating mandate which was adopted by the Council on 13 September 1999. The Council has taken careful note of the Commission’s commitment to remain within this mandate and to remain vigilant about any adverse impact of a possible agreement, in particular on the most sensitive products.</p>
<p>In this respect, it should be underlined that Commissioner Ciolos has repeatedly recognised the sensitivity of the Mercosur negotiations for the EU agriculture sector. Most recently at the Council session on 17 March 2011, he assured the Council that the Commission is following a cautious approach in these negotiations, taking into account the defensive and offensive interests of the EU in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>On the issue of consistency between agricultural policy and trade policy and the consequences of the re-launch of negotiations with the Mercosur, the attention of the honourable Member is drawn to the conclusions adopted by the Council in June 2010 on the international competitiveness of the European agri-food model<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A growing world population results in increasing food demand. Droughts, floods and natural catastrophes have played their part together with surging energy prices and export restrictions by some of our global partners. Moreover, excessive price volatility can destabilise agricultural economies and affect food security at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>In this context, two of the objectives of the CAP as set out in the Treaty are particularly important. First, ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. Second, increasing agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour.</p>
<p>The June 2010 European Council's concluded that a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition</p>
<p>The Presidency conclusions on the CAP towards 2020<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which were supported last month by a very large majority of Members of the Council, recognise that economically viable and environmentally sustainable food production remains the key objective for the future CAP.</p>
<p>The Council has noted the views of the European Parliament as expressed in recent resolutions, particularly on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, on the EU protein deficit and on the link between EU agriculture and international trade. The Council looks forward to the debate with the Parliament on the Commission's proposals on the CAP post 2013 later in the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In its Conclusions on Improving Environmental Policy Instruments, adopted on 20 December 2010, the Council welcomed that more environmental considerations have been integrated into strategic initiatives like the Europe 2020 Strategy, which puts forward the promotion of a more resource efficient, greener and more competitive economy<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Council also called for intensified greening of the EU Financial Framework, inter alia to promote the transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon, resource efficient, biodiversity friendly and climate resilient economy<a href="#defann_4_2" name="refann_4_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In its Conclusions of 4 February 2011<a href="#defann_4_3" name="refann_4_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the European Council underlined that it is vital to promote a regulatory framework attractive to investment. It was highlighted that the EU and its Member States will promote investment in renewable and safe and sustainable low carbon technologies and focus on implementing the technology priorities established in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan.<a href="#defann_4_4" name="refann_4_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Furthermore, it is stated that at national level, Member States recall their willingness to devote at least 50% of ETS revenue to finance climate-related action, including innovative projects. The European Council also underlined that investments in energy efficiency will enhance competitiveness and support security of energy supply and sustainability at low cost and that a determined action is needed to tap the considerable potential for higher energy savings of buildings, transport, products and processes.<a href="#defann_4_5" name="refann_4_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Council also stressed, in its Conclusions on "Energy 2020: A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy", adopted on 28 February <a href="#defann_4_6" name="refann_4_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, that, building upon the SET-Plan activities, initiatives concerning technologies in relation with electricity storage, sustainable biofuels, smart grids, and smart cities, as well as clean vehicles, ocean and marine energy should be launched. The Council stressed also that the EU competitive position should be reflected in the financial commitments of the industry as well as in public funding terms and would benefit from a range of financial instruments. Research, development and deployment of safe and sustainable low carbon technologies should be prioritized in future programmes.</p>
<p>The Council also considered that leverage of existing means could be facilitated by making use of innovative financing mechanisms. Possible innovative financing tools would need further analysis and they would need to be flexible in order to cater for national circumstances.</p>
<p>The European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR)<a href="#defann_4_7" name="refann_4_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> provides financing for energy projects to contribute i.a. to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The complementing measure adopted in 2010<a href="#defann_4_8" name="refann_4_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> created a financial facility giving additional support to energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.</p>
<p>In total, EU level financial support to renewable energies has amounted to roughly 3.26 bn EUR per year during the 2007-2009 period<a href="#defann_4_9" name="refann_4_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>. A major new source of financial support for renewables at the EU level is the "NER 300" programme<a href="#defann_4_10" name="refann_4_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Investment in "green" innovation and infrastructure is also supported through Cohesion Policy<a href="#defann_4_11" name="refann_4_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>, the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme<a href="#defann_4_12" name="refann_4_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> (including through the tool ELENA), and the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (2007-2013)<a href="#defann_4_13" name="refann_4_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In March 2011, the Commission presented the Communication “Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050”<a href="#defann_4_14" name="refann_4_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> (the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap) and the Communication on an "Energy Efficiency Plan 2011"<a href="#defann_4_15" name="refann_4_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a>, currently under discussion in the Council.</p>
<p>Important decisions will be taken in the next few months, for instance in terms of the Multiannual Financial Framework, the implementation of the White Paper on Transport, the Energy Efficiency Plan, and the Common Agricultural Policy. It is therefore key for the Environment Council, in its June session, to agree on a set of conclusions that set out strategic and operational steps forward.</p>
<p>In light of the above, on 14 March, the Environmental Council welcomed the presentation of the Commission on the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap and stated that it aims to adopt Council Conclusions at the June Environmental Council on it, with a view to the June 2011 European Council. Furthermore, as energy efficiency has a central role in a low-carbon growth and is closely linked to the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap, it is important to note that the TTE- Energy Council also plans to adopt council conclusions on the Energy Efficiency Plan 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The European Union is fighting homelessness and housing exclusion in the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy, adopted by the European Council on 17 June 2010<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Actions on this matter are taken more specifically under the heading of the flagship initiative "European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion: A European framework for social and territorial cohesion"<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This Platform will set a dynamic framework for action to ensure that people experiencing poverty and social exclusion are enabled to live in dignity and take an active part in society<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In its Conclusions on the Platform, adopted on 7 March 2011, the Council recalled "that certain groups of the population are particularly exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion while others are subject to the most extreme forms of poverty (such as homelessness)"<a href="#defann_5_4" name="refann_5_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The homelessness issue is covered by the Open Method of Coordination in the area of Social Protection and Social Inclusion (Social OMC), including peer reviews. In order to support national strategies in the fight against homelessness, the Council bases its work on the outcome of the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, organised in December 2010 under Belgian Presidency<a href="#defann_5_5" name="refann_5_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, and on the 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion<a href="#defann_5_6" name="refann_5_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. In this report it is underlined that integrated strategies to address housing exclusion and homelessness have an important role to play in post-crisis policies, with a view to build cohesive and environmentally sustainable societies<a href="#defann_5_7" name="refann_5_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. In its contribution to the European Council (24-25 March 2011), the Social Protection Committee underlines that it will continue work on homelessness and housing exclusion<a href="#defann_5_8" name="refann_5_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In December 2010, the Council adopted a Declaration on "The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion: Working together to fight poverty in 2010 and beyond"<a href="#defann_5_9" name="refann_5_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>, in order to mark the closing of this European Year. In this declaration the Council underlined that particular attention should be given to vulnerable groups and to extreme forms of poverty such as homelessness. The Council also highlighted that the European Union and its Member States should work together at European, national, regional and local levels in the fight against poverty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the fact that Turkey maintains geographical limitations to the Geneva Convention on refugees and its supplementary protocol. The EU position on the matter, however, remains very clear - this limitation is not in line with the EU acquis on asylum, and Turkey should lift it, and fully implement the Geneva Convention and its supplementary protocol.</p>
<p>Turkey, as a candidate country, has to meet the political criteria set down by the Copenhagen European Council, in particular by fulfilling the requirements of the Negotiating Framework and the Accession Partnership. It also follows from the Negotiating Framework that Turkey is expected to progressively align with the EU acquis - including in the area of asylum.</p>
<p>The lifting of this geographical limitation is also highlighted as a priority in the revised Accession Partnership with Turkey. I would like to recall that the Council systematically calls on Turkey to step up its efforts in meeting the requirements specified in the Negotiating Framework, covering inter alia implementation of the Accession Partnership. The need for sustained efforts in the area of asylum was particularly stressed by the Union at the EU-Turkey Association Council (Ministerial level) on 10 May 2010, and the matter is also regularly raised by the Commission in its meetings with Turkey.</p>
<p>I can therefore assure the honourable Member that this issue will continue to be closely followed and systematically raised at all levels, as appropriate, as full implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol forms part of the requirements against which Turkey's progress in the negotiations is being measured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000126"></a>

<p>These changes will have lasting consequences for the people and countries of the region. We pay tribute to the courage demonstrated by the people of the region. They have pursued with dignity their legitimate aspirations for democratic change. The changes now underway carry the hope for better life and for greater respect of human rights, pluralism, the rule of law and social justice.</p>
<p>Movement towards democracy is not an easy path - there are risks and uncertainties associated with these transitions. While acknowledging the difficulties, the European Union has taken the clear option of supporting the quest of the peoples of the region for democratic change.</p>
<p>The European Union is keen to support countries in search for a transition from autocratic regimes to democracy, as it has done notably in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The EU is determined to support all steps towards democratic transformation, allowing for peaceful change, growth and prosperity in the Southern neighbourhood. This was confirmed at the highest level by the European Council at its extraordinary meeting of 11 March 2011. Heads of States and governments discussed the developments in the region and extended their full support to the ongoing democratic transformation. They underlined our shared interest for a democratic, stable, prosperous and peaceful Southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>With a view to a qualitative step forward in our relations with our Southern neighbours, the Commission and the High Representative on 8 March released a joint Communication on a "Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean".</p>
<p>The Communication is based on the principle of a joint commitment to commonly shared values such as democracy, human rights, social justice, good governance and the rule of law. The demands for political participation, dignity, freedom and employment opportunities expressed in recent weeks can only be addressed through ambitious political and economic reforms. All countries in the region need to undertake or accelerate such political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Our renewed policy should take into account the specificity of each situation and country in the region. Existing partnership and assistance programmes will be reviewed in close cooperation with the partners in the region, with the objective of better targeting present needs, based on a country-focused approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000133"></a>

In those Conclusions, the Council reaffirms "the need to continue investing in transport infrastructure to ensure proper development of the TEN-T in all transport modes, as a basis for the internal market and competitiveness, economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union and its connection to neighbouring countries, focusing on the "European added value", and taking into account, inter alia, environmental objectives, when defining the future TEN-T policy." It also emphasises that, "while major transnational traffic flows are an important criterion for the planning of the TEN-T, economic, social and territorial cohesion and access to the TEN-T are vital too, and are addressed, to a large extent, by the comprehensive network layer of the current TEN-T; therefore, and given its importance as a reference basis for a variety of legislation in the transport sector, advocates maintaining this comprehensive network."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to bring to the attention of the honourable Member that, to its knowledge, in the European Union 143 nuclear power reactors (and not nuclear power plants) are in operation. Further 51 nuclear power reactors are in operation in the Russian Federation, Switzerland and Ukraine<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>During its extraordinary meeting on energy on 21 March 2011<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Council discussed the response at EU and Member state level to the recent developments in Japan. The Presidency highlighted that the priority is, first and foremost, to provide this country with humanitarian as well as technical assistance.</p>
<p>As far as nuclear safety is concerned, during the same meeting the Council underlined that the priority is to ensure that the highest standards are in force and that improving safety is a continuing process. The Council also welcomed voluntary steps taken by national authorities and industry operators regarding the review of the safety of nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>The Council took also note that there is a shared willingness to launch a process for the definition of a comprehensive risk and safety assessment ("stress-test") of nuclear plants in Europe. In this context, the Council underlined the importance of transparency regarding both the outcome of this assessment and measures taken by member states at national level.</p>
<p>On the same meeting, Member States and the Commission invited ENSREG (European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group) and other relevant bodies to define the scope and modalities of such tests, making use of the available expertise and in due course of the lessons to be learnt from the recent accident. The Council took note of the possible areas (flood risks, seismic risks, back-up systems, emergency procedures) that could be the basis for this assessment. The Council also underlined the need to involve neighbouring third countries in a similar safety and risk assessment for existing and future plants.</p>
<p>These conclusions have been confirmed by the European Council on its meeting of 24-25 March 2011<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The European Council underlined that the assessments ("stress-tests") will be conducted by independent national authorities and through peer review and that their outcome and any necessary subsequent measures that will be taken should be shared with the Commission and within the ENSREG and should be made public. The European Council will assess initial findings by the end of 2011, on the basis of a report from the Commission.</p>
<p>The European Council highlighted that the priority of ensuring the safety of nuclear plants obviously cannot stop at our borders and that the EU will request that similar "stress tests" be carried out in the neighbouring countries and worldwide, regarding both existing and planned plants. In this regard full use should be made of relevant international organisations.</p>
<p>In this context, the European Council also underlined that the highest standards for nuclear safety should be implemented and continuously improved in the EU and promoted internationally.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights Council (HRC), clarifies that the Members of this body have to "uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, and shall fully cooperate with the Council". Consequently, when electing the 47 Members of the HRC, the General Assembly shall take into account the human rights records and commitments of all candidates.</p>
<p>Until now, the UN General Assembly has not fully implemented this principle, as we have seen in the case of Libya. That is why the issue of “quality membership” must form an important part of the ongoing HRC Review, and indeed the UN General Assembly decided to include the issue in the New York leg of the Review. The co-facilitators appointed by the President of the General Assembly to steer the HRC Review debate in New York organised a first meeting specifically to address this matter on 29 March. As a contribution to this debate, the EU has put forward concrete ideas, such as holding hearings for candidates to the HRC prior to the elections, involving Member States, NGOs and National Human Rights Institutions. These hearings should focus on voluntary pledges and commitments, as well as on how the candidate country intends to comply with the requirement of upholding the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000117"></a>

<p>(EN) While the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological development (FP7, 2007-2013) does not provide for sports-related research as such, FP7 does promote research on the health benefits of physical activity.</p>
<p>The FP7 Health and Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Biotechnologies Themes and the Regions of Knowledge activity, have however addressed physical activity and its links to health promotion and disease prevention and development through a number of FP7 projects. Some EUR 39 million have been invested in such research funding over the period 2005 to 2010, translating into some eight EU projects. On-going evaluations may also result in other projects being funded in this area.</p>
<p>A number of relevant FP7 projects have been funded over the last four years. The PAPA project aims to promote adolescent health through a behavioural change intervention aimed at improved the quality of their participation in physical activity via youth sport, in particular football.

The EXGENSIS project (FP6) focuses on intracellular signaling pathways during exercise and the effects of such exercise. The TOYBOX project uses behavioural models to understand and promote fun, healthy food, play and policy for the prevention of obesity in early childhood, while the I.FAMILY project starting in March 2012 will investigate how the built environment impacts on physical activity, sedentary behaviours and sleep patterns interact with dietary behaviour.</p>
<p>At a regional level, the AFRESH project aims at developing a research agenda for reducing diet- and physical inactivity-related (chronic) diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and various types of cancer, by developing innovative products and services within the field of nutrition and physical activity.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission fully recognises the fact that physical activity is a key factor contributing to the prevention of major lifestyle related diseases such as obesity and that relevant research is needed to provide the necessary basis for more effective and efficient evidence-based strategies of health promotion and disease prevention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000121"></a>

<p>(EN) The United States is the international partner with whom the European Union has the richest, most intensive relations in Science and Technology (S&amp;T). This is true from all points of view: amounts of mutual Research and Development (R&amp;D) investment, flows of scientists and researchers, volumes of cooperative activities and the number of co-authored publications and patents. International cooperation is important for supporting the Europe 2020 goals and so activities with the United States need to be a priority. The Commissioner in charge for Industry and Entrepreneurship, Mr Tajani, has travelled to the United States (US) twice in 2010 to boost the EU-US collaboration, including the first trip abroad as Commissioner.</p>
<p>The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013) is the main funding mechanism for European-level research, which also supports the EU's international cooperation. Outside Europe, the United States is the number one participant in the 7th Framework Programme, with well over 300 signed grant agreements and other collaborations. Its participation is particularly strong in the themes of Health, Information and Communication Technologies, Nanotechnologies and Materials, Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and Biotechnologies, and Environment.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the United States was renewed in 2009 until 2013. In May 2010 in Washington DC the annual joint meeting was held under this agreement, coordinated on the United States side by the Department of State. Both parties took stock of progress under that agreement, and new ways of working together are being developed. These range from the twinning of projects through to the mutual opening of research programmes, such as those in the area of health research with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The next meeting under the agreement is planned for September 2011 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The S&amp;T agreement also provides the framework for a number of Implementing Arrangements with specific United States government departments and agencies. One example is the Implementing Arrangement with the Department of Homeland Security on civil security research, which was signed in November 2010 by the Commissioner in charge for Industry and Entrepreneurship Mr Tajani. The Joint Research Centre is currently leading discussions on a similar arrangement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), on issues as diverse as environmental contaminants, coastal hazards, space weather, climate change and crisis management. This year will also see the renewal of our 20-year relationship with the United States on biotechnology research, as well as the continuation of our dialogue on civil space cooperation.</p>
<p>Innovation is an area where Europe has a strong interest in sharing experiences with the United States on how best to turn knowledge into stronger economic growth and job creation. Among the most interesting developments over the past year is the new Transatlantic Innovation Action Partnership, launched under the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). This partnership responds to the political direction given to the TEC at the last EU-US summit, i.e. to promote innovation, streamline regulation, and eliminate barriers to trade and investment. In December 2010, the TEC agreed on an initial work plan for the Innovation Action Partnership. Work has started in the areas of the bio-economy, raw materials and the cross-cutting aspects of innovation policy.</p>
<p>The EU-US Energy Council, established at the end of 2009, is another important development. Three working groups – on energy policy, technologies development and markets – have established themselves and agreed their remits during 2010. The Working Group on Technology and R&amp;D has organised itself to produce operational deliverables. The EU also collaborates with the United States in multilateral settings such as the fusion reactor, ITER<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In order to gain more from joint efforts, the Commission will continue working on a more strategic focus to our research collaboration. This will concentrate on the global challenges, and be consistent with the Europe 2020 goals, as well as the aims of the Innovation Union initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member rightly states, the Innovation Union is at the heart of our strategy for growth and jobs. It will help secure future economic growth for the EU through the development of our capacity to create new knowledge and to transform it into successful products. A key role in this process will be played by enhanced research cooperation between the Member States, notably through Joint Programming.</p>
<p>Concerning the expansion of R&amp;D in certain regions, the underlying principle governing the allocation of research funding under the Framework Programme is excellence. This means that only the very best research proposals are selected for funding. It is not possible therefore, nor would it be desirable, for the Commission to try to direct research funding under the FP to specific regions.</p>
<p>However, as the honourable Member suggests, it is clear that some regions have established advantages in given domains of research, whether they be natural advantages or related to past investment in research capacity, including human resources. Regions with such advantages will be well placed to submit strong research proposals that have a good chance of attracting EU research funding.</p>
<p>Of course, regional advantages will not always be as obvious as sunshine in Spain and wind in Ireland. Therefore, regions need to be able to identify and develop their potential advantages. This is why the Commission is strongly in favour of the development of smart specialisation strategies in the regions.</p>
<p>Smart specialisation is one of the 10 conditions for well-performing national and regional research and innovation systems under the Innovation Union's self assessment tool. It aims at encouraging national and regional authorities to concentrate resources on a limited number of priorities to ensure a more effective use of public funds and help to leverage private investment.</p>
<p>Smart specialisation strategies are a means to exploit regional diversity, stimulate cooperation across national and regional borders and open up new opportunities by avoiding fragmentation and ensuring that knowledge flows more freely across the EU. They can be instrumental in helping regions to identify both their key assets and the factors that hamper innovation; to concentrate resources on key priorities and to design the right policy mix to unleash smart growth. They can also ensure a more effective and complimentary use of EU funds and national and regional investments.</p>
<p>To assist the regions in this process the Commission is in the process of launching a ‘Smart Specialisation Platform’ with the necessary resources to spread information, encourage mutual learning and increase capacities and skills.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000129"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers research in the HIV/AIDS and in malaria fields as a high priority and has been supporting research in these areas through the Research Framework Programmes (FP), with the overall aim to structure and integrate European research by creating a close partnership between research teams in European and disease-endemic countries as well as between industrial and public sector research.</p>
<p>From 1998 until 2010, the EU has supported collaborative research with EUR 259.9 million on 84 HIV/AIDS projects and EUR 150.3 million on 59 malaria projects. EU-funded research includes new therapeutic and preventive strategies against the two diseases, from early discovery to clinical testing of new drugs, vaccine candidates, HIV microbicides and new tools for malaria vector control. Throughout its funding, strong emphasis has been put on collaboration with disease-endemic countries, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa. Particular achievements have been the comparability of data sets on new drugs or vaccine candidates, helping to harmonize pre-clinical assays and animal models and making European research more competitive at international level.</p>
<p>Two concrete examples are: the HIVIS project, which delivered an IV/AIDS vaccine candidate, which is now in the late phases of clinical trial to assess safety and immunogenicity, and the malaria basic research network BioMalPar, which has developed into a cornerstone of EU basic research with an integrative malaria graduate school. At present the Commission is setting its priorities for future funding in the HIV/AIDS and malaria areas for the next 2012 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013) Health calls.</p>
<p>In 2003, the European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established by the EU to support clinical research and capacity building on the three main poverty-related diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP is the first initiative based on Article 169 of the EU treaty (now Article 185). It is funded with EUR 200 million by the EU through FP6 and co-funded with EUR 200 million from 16 European EDCTP partner countries. Additional co-funding comes from third parties. Since 2003, EDCTP supported 163 projects with a total value of approximately EUR 311 million. Among these are 54 clinical trials of which 24 are on HIV/AIDS (EUR 102 million) and 12 on malaria (EUR 68 million). EDCTP as succeeded to build a true partnership between Europe and Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000137"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission intends that EU funding for research and innovation will be provided from 2014 onwards through a Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation Funding.</p>
<p>The Common Strategic Framework was proposed in the EU Budget Review. The main principles on which it will be based were outlined there: supporting key Europe 2020 policy priorities, increasing EU added value and generating more impact from EU expenditure.</p>
<p>The aim of the Common Strategic Framework is to make EU research and innovation funding more efficient, with greater impact and providing simplified access for participants.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted on 9 February 2011 a Green Paper entitled: “From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU research and innovation funding”<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Green Paper has outlined three major objectives for the Common Strategic Framework: tackling major societal challenges, strengthening the competitiveness of Europe's industry and raising the levels of excellence in the European research base. Research into food, agriculture and biotechnology can contribute to tackle these challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission is seeking input from as broad a range of stakeholders as possible, including that of the other EU institutions. Stakeholders are invited to provide input until 20 May 2011.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently consulting its stakeholders and the outcome of the consultation will feed into its further proposal development. Therefore, it is at this stage premature to discuss the possible architecture of the future programme or the role of any particular themes or sectors therein, including potential budgets. The overall budget will depend on the decisions on the future multi-annual financial perspectives for the post 2013 period.</p>
<p>Several studies and reports (United Kingdom Foresight "The Future of Food and Farming", the on-going work on agriculture foresight carried out by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research, the 2009 OECD report on "Challenges for Agricultural Research", etc.) advocate for ambitious research programmes in agriculture. They focus on the challenges that agriculture will need to respond to in the coming decades: catering for the food needs of a growing population, with more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable practices deriving from increases in scarcities (water, energy, soil depletion, etc.), taking into account the needs to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>Within this context a number of important questions arise. How should research and innovation best enhance the smart use of biological (animal and plant production and health and their inputs, biomass availability, forestry management and waste), and physical resources (land use, soil integrity, water availability, climate change, etc)? How can research and innovation best contribute to increase yields and enhance soils in a sustainable manner, while preserving, ecosystems? How can the agri-sector competiveness best be fostered through science and technology applied to farming, food processing and bio based industries? All those questions and many more will be duly considered in the coming months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) With reference to the honourable Members question on what steps the Commission has taken in response to the alleged violations of EU environmental law with regard to the Kaliakra Peninsula and other Natura 2000 protected areas in Bulgaria, the Commission would refer to the number of infringement procedures it has initiated against Bulgaria, and to the constructive dialogue it has engaged in with both the Bulgarian authorities and the environmental NGOs.</p>
<p>More specifically, with regard to the Special Protection Areas (SPAs) part of the Natura 2000 network in Bulgaria, as a result of the above-mentioned dialogue the Commission is expecting concrete steps for the extension of Rila, Pirin, Lomovete, Central Balkan, and Western Rhodopes SPAs. The Bulgarian authorities committed to finalize and formally adopt those extensions by the end of March 2011. The Commission was informed that on 11.3.2011 the National Council for Biodiversity, which is the expert advisory body to the Bulgarian Minister of Environment and Water, has discussed concrete proposals for extensions of the above-mentioned SPAs. This indicates that the relevant national procedure is moving forward as agreed. With regard to Kaliakra SPA, recently both the Bulgarian authorities and the environmental NGOs submitted large quantity of technical information which the Commission services are carefully studying and evaluating.</p>
<p>With reference to the honourable Members question on what action the Commission will take to ensure that the irregularities referred to in the complementary letter of formal notice (LFN) sent to the Bulgarian authorities on 18.3.2010 are rectified, the Commission would refer to the large amount of technical information submitted by the Bulgarian authorities in their reply to the complementary LFN of 20.5.2010, and in their additional communication of 8.9.2010. This LFN is additional to the LFN sent on 3.11.2009. Both letters address large number of plans and projects authorised without considering the protection of IBAs and SPAs. Given the volumes and complexity of the information received, the technical assessment has been outsourced and is expected to be finalized by the end of March 2011. Furthermore, additional technical information has been provided to the Commission by environmental NGOs on 3.3.2011. This information is currently being carefully studied and evaluated.</p>

Furthermore, any future decisions with regard to the infringement procedures against Bulgaria for bad application of EU environmental law are decisions for the Commission as a whole and will be based on both sound legal analysis as well as precise factual and scientific information.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Only 17% of the Species and Habitats of European conservation concern, protected under the EU Habitats Directive, have a favourable conservation status.</p>
<p>Reaching the new 2020 EU headline target to halt biodiversity loss and restore ecosystems and the services they provide will require a significant effort to step up implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives to ensure significant and measurable progress towards achieving a favourable conservation status for species and habitats of European importance. This headline target will be addressed in a new EU Biodiversity Strategy that will be adopted by the Commission shortly. The Strategy will also respond to the global commitments made by the EU in Nagoya last October in the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>The EU Birds and Habitats Directives are critical tools to achieve EU biodiversity goals and as they stand are fully fit for purpose. The Commission will therefore not accept their watering down at this crucial time of implementation.</p>
<p>As regards implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation more generally, the Commission intends to come forward with a new Communication on this issue later in 2011 in order to improve the overall governance structure and knowledge base that underpins the implementation of the environmental acquis. In the context of this initiative, the Commission will reflect in detail on possible options for strengthening the monitoring and control capabilities at EU level and the national inspection systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000135"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission takes due account of scientific assessment, where decisions on environmental matters are concerned. This is in fact a requirement under the Treaty, which specifically stipulates that environment policy shall take account of available scientific data, and the Commission is committed to an evidence and science-based approach to policy-making.</p>
<p>In developing and implementing EU environment policy, the Commission uses research, data and analysis of the European Environment Agency, the Joint Research Centre and other EU-funded research. It also commissions specific studies to bring together the most relevant, best and up-to-date knowledge, as and when required.</p>
<p>Whilst Member States remain fully responsible for the full and correct implementation of European environmental legislation and requirements, the Commission takes a strict but helpful approach in its role of ensuring they meet these obligations. On the one hand it takes a strict but balanced approach to infringements, whilst on the other hand it seeks to offer as much assistance as possible in pursuit of the delivery of EU environment policy objectives, so that EU-wide environmental improvements can be achieved.</p>
<p>Solidarity is a core principle of the EU. One of the ways solidarity is expressed is via the EU budget. Financial support is available to Member States from the LIFE-plus environment financial instrument. Support from the Structural Funds is also possible. The Cohesion Fund, for example, contributes some EUR6.5 billion per year towards environmental infrastructure, focusing on waste water, water supply and waste, mostly in the new Member States.</p>
<p>Other significant environment-related funding is available under Rural Development, managed through the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, scientific capacity-building in the environment field is supported through EU-funded research.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports the Member States' efforts to achieve environmental goals in a number of other ways, inter alia by issuing guidelines that aim to provide information useful to those implementing environment policy. In specific areas of policy where this is thought to be useful, these guidelines go beyond the information provided within EU environment legislation and are drafted with better implementation in mind. Also, specific advice is offered to individual Member States by the European Commission, e.g. through periodic 'package meetings' where a number of environment policy implementation issues can be raised in a bilateral setting. In addition, the Commission gives individual expert advice to officials at various levels in Member States, on request. And finally, there is a wide range of support offered by the European Environment Agency, whose role includes support for Member States and others across a wide range of policy issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000146"></a>

<p>(EN) The demand of all types of raw material – including precious metals – is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. In order to face this challenging situation, building a more resource-efficient society is crucial to the EU’s economic and ecological security.</p>
<p>In that context, the Commission has recently adopted 3 interconnected Communications:</p>
<p>1. the Communication on a 'Resource Efficient Europe'<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which provides a strategic framework to shift towards resource-efficient growth in Europe. Improve waste management in order to use waste as resource is obviously a central element of this strategy;</p>
<p>2. the report on the Thematic Strategy on Waste Prevention and Recycling<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> identifying the main success and limitations of the European recycling policies and including clear proposals to make progress to set up a "recycling society"; and</p>
<p>3. the Communication on Raw materials<a href="#defann_20_3" name="refann_20_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> consisting in an integrated strategy to ensure the sustainable availability of raw material notably through resource efficiency and recycling.</p>
<p>Increasing collection and recycling of electronic waste is one of the practical elements of these strategies and the Commission agrees with the honourable Member that more needs to be done. Gathering the electronic waste from many small sources is a big collective task which is best achieved by setting a clear and ambitious legislative framework. This is the reason for being of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, or WEEE<a href="#defann_20_4" name="refann_20_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> The current collection rate is about one third of waste electrical and electronic equipment generated, and it is realistic to raise it to 85% by 2016 as proposed by the Commission<a href="#defann_20_5" name="refann_20_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and as supported by the Parliament in first reading. The Council has proposed a later date (2020 or 2022) for achieving such an ambition level and new promising debates are expected in the coming months to finalise this dossier in second reading.</p>
<p>The WEEE Directive also includes minimum recycling targets, differentiated by category of equipment. According to the 'producer responsibility' principle, producers are responsible to set up systems for the proper treatment of WEEE collected. They profit from the recovery of precious materials, which indeed are a significant source of secondary often precious raw material.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the foreseeable future recycling can not replace the use of primary materials entirely. Demand for new products keeps rising, the resources become available only after a certain time, and recycling rates are not 100%. Collection and recycling rates must be raised as much as possible. And while primary mining is still needed, rules remain necessary to ensure that extractive industries operate in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
<p>There is a comprehensive set of rules in place for this purpose, including the Directives on Environmental Impact Assessments, Strategic Environmental Assessments, and Industrial Emissions. More specifically, cyanide mining technologies are covered in the Mining Waste Directive. The Commission's priority must be to ensure the full implementation of this Directive. It includes several requirements to ensure the safety of mining waste facilities and limit their impact on the environment. Strict limit values for cyanide concentration – the strictest world wide to the Commission's best knowledge - are defined in the Directive.</p>
<p>Waste facilities have to be operated using the "best available technique" concept as defined in a publically available reference document. The Commission is now working on the development of inspection guidance for the Member States to ensure a full enforcement of the Directive.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission would like to insist on the importance of moving towards a resource efficient society. The example provided by the honourable Member on the recycling of discarded mobile phones is particularly relevant. Recycling more provides several advantages from reducing environmental impacts to ensuring a sustainable and stable access to raw material and developing jobs and innovation in the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 11 March 2011, the Commission adopted a Commission Decision<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the United Kingdom (UK) request to be exempted from the obligation to apply the PM10 limit values in London and Gibraltar. As regards London, this was the second time the UK requested an exemption after the first request was rejected by the Commission in December 2009.</p>
<p>According to this Decision, the UK authorities have to adjust the air quality plan for London by 11 June 2011. This is the date by which the exemption ends and the PM10 daily limit value will have to be met.</p>
<p>As stated in the Commission Decision, the UK has produced an air quality plan outlining how it plans to reach compliance by 11 June 2011. However, in view of the very narrow margin by which compliance is projected and the risk of further exceedances, the Commission has asked the UK authorities to adopt further measures effective for controlling or, where necessary, suspending activities which contribute to the risk of the limit value being exceeded. This is meant to ensure the full toolbox for addressing exceedances is readily available when/if required, irrespective of whether such exceedances would appear.</p>
<p>The competence to decide on the measures lies entirely with the Member States. Under the "subsidiarity" principle it is acknowledged that Member States - and their local authorities - are best placed to identify the most efficient and tailor made measures to address high concentration levels in their air quality zones.</p>
<p>As the long term measures are provided for in the already existing air quality plan, the short-term measures are meant to address any risk of exceedances during, for example, specific pollution episodes. Those measures are therefore not supposed to address a sustained exceedance problem over the long-term but rather meant to be seen as complementing instead of 'emergency' actions.</p>
<p>Measures that could fall under this category could be measures in relation to motor-vehicle traffic, construction works, the use of industrial plants or products and domestic heating. They could consist of controlling and, where necessary, suspending those activities contributing to the risk of the limit value being exceeded. Specific actions aimed at the protection of sensitive population groups, including children, may also be considered.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands the concerns of the honourable Member. Similar preoccupations have been expressed by other Members of the European Parliament, Member States and the European industry.</p>
<p>At the moment, the EU has no international commitments vis-à-vis China in the area of public procurement. As a consequence, Chinese suppliers and/or Chinese goods do not enjoy a secured access to the EU procurement markets, unlike the General Partnership Agreement (GPA) or Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners for sectors covered by these agreements. Since China is currently negotiating accession to the GPA this situation could change in the coming years. In the context of the accession process the EU requests China to commit to setting ambitious market access goals.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Commission will present a legislative proposal clarifying the terms of access to the EU public procurement markets for bids and suppliers from third countries, covering procurement committed internationally and procurement not committed. The objective of this proposal will be to restore fair competition in the internal market and to ensure an increased leverage of the EU in international negotiations. This proposal has been announced by the Commission in its Communications "Towards a Single Market Act"<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and "Trade, Growth and World Affairs"<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It will clarify the position of third countries (and their suppliers) which have not subscribed to any international commitments vis-à-vis the EU in this field and should be based on a principle of reciprocity. The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment in order to make a cost-benefit analysis of the possible options.</p>
<p>The current EU rules on public procurement already contain provisions on abnormally low tenders. These provisions give contracting authorities the power, after having verified the constituent elements of the tender, to reject the tender if they consider that there are no sufficient guarantees that the tenderer will perform the contract according to the terms offered. Moreover, contracting authorities should require contractors to execute the works in accordance with the terms of the concluded contract and can, under the conditions defined in the law of the Member State concerned, ask the competent court to issue an injunction to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that European business and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to bear disproportionately high costs when they seek patent protection in Europe. Most of these costs come from the patent translation requirements imposed by the Member States. It is clear that these costs have an adverse effect on the global competitiveness innovative businesses in Europe.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Commission presented a proposal with the objective of creating an EU patent. The EU patent would have allowed SMEs to get patent protection through a single application in the entire EU. Also, the translation requirements would have been limited.</p>
<p>Member States, however, could not reach a unianimous agreement that would have been necessary for the creation of the EU patent. This failure was confirmed at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 10 December 2010 and subsequently 25 Member States decided to embark on enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection.</p>
<p>On 10 March 2011, following the consent given by the European Parliament, the Competitiveness Council authorised the launch of enhanced cooperation between 25 Member States. At this stage, Spain and Italy decided not to participate. They have the possibility to join in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission will soon present its proposals for the implementing regulations with simplified registration and translation requirements. The timely adoption of these regulations by the Council and the European Parliament would ensure that European SMEs could get patent protection for the territories of 25 Member States for less than 10% of the sum they have to pay today for patent protection in the entire EU. In addition they would continue to have the possiblity to apply for patent protection in Spain and Italy. If they do, they would still not pay more altogether than 20% of the sum they have to pay today for patent protection in the 27 countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000130"></a>

<p>The red mud disaster in Hungary raised awareness of functioning technologies for the industrial utilisation and recycling of red mud, as highlighted by several European and international experts. According to scientific calculations, a considerable amount of iron, titanium and other rare metals can be extracted from red mud, but the material can also be applied in the construction industry, namely in cement production. Such tests have been conducted in Japan and in India. It is calculated that approximately 220 million tons of red mud is stored within the territory of the EU in various forms. These solutions are within reach. Nonetheless, further research is needed in order to perfect them, and their application will require considerable investment.</p>
<p>Does the Commission think that financing research into such technologies is in the interest of European citizens? What possible European financial resources can be applied for this purpose?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the Communication on raw materials adopted on 2<span class="sup">nd</span> February 2011, the Commission stated that the extraction of useful materials from waste – including mining waste – is one of the main sources of metals and minerals for European industry. It was also recognised that the use of secondary raw materials contributes to resource efficiency, to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, to the preservation of the environment and the reduction of external dependence on raw materials.</p>
<p>That said, the potential of many of these resources is not being fully exploited and the barriers which prevent recycling need to be further addressed.</p>
<p>In order to help address this situation, in 2011 the Commission will assess whether to launch an Innovation Partnership on raw materials within the Europe 2020 Flagship on Innovation Union. Such a partnership could enhance innovation in recycling and in other parts of the raw materials value chain. As such, innovative ways to recover resources from mining waste – including 'red mud' – could be considered within this proposed partnership.</p>
<p>Under the next FP7 call for proposals to be published in July 2011, the industrial technologies theme called "Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies" – NMP plans to finance R&amp;D proposals on new environmentally friendly approaches in minerals processing.</p>
<p>The planned mineral processing topic is directly relevant to the question in terms of targeting R&amp;D on:</p>
<p>novel technologies for the processing of low-quality raw materials and tailings with increased removal of impurities and recovery of usable minerals, including base and precious metals, but also critical raw materials for the EU , for example rare earth elements;</p>
<p>closed process system with non-toxic reagents with zero impact on existing surroundings, and where appropriate mobile mineral processing plants;</p>
<p>advanced waste, water and energy management; and</p>
<p>better process control and automation through intelligent IT based systems for process intensification and reducing human exposure.</p>
<p>Red mud recycling is also covered by this research topic. It is expected that between EUR 15-20 Mio will be spent on several research projects.</p>
<p>In addition, LIFE is the EU’s financial instrument supporting environmental and nature conservation projects throughout the EU. In 2003, a Greek project on "Rehabilitation of abandoned bauxite surface mines using alumina red mud as filler" was financed by LIFE. This project (LIFE03 ENV/GR/000213) succeeded in developing a full design for the refilling of abandoned open pit mines with red mud. Its tests showed the success and potential environmental benefits of this innovative dry disposal system of red mud as a way of both rehabilitating disused pits and reducing pollution of the sea.</p>
<p>The LIFE programme is composed of three strands (LIFE+ Nature &amp; Biodiversity; LIFE+ Environment Policy &amp; Governance and LIFE+ Information &amp; Communication). A project on industrial reutilization and recycling of red mud in Europe could be financed under the LIFE+ Environment Policy &amp; Governance strand.</p>
<p>The LIFE + 2011 Call for porposals has been published the 26 February 2011 and the deadline for the applicants to send their proposals is set at 18 July 2011.</p>
<p>Finally, recycling is one of the prioirites under the Competitiveness and Innovaiton Framework Programme- eco-innovation strand. The market replication projects support innovative solutions concerned with replication of eco-innovative techniques, products, services or practices. This instrument is oriented towards SMEs and aims to close the gap between research and market up-take as well as broader market penetration of eco-innovation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000131"></a>

<p>We now have all the necessary elements in place to start undertaking the preparatory work for the pilot including, notably, drawing up recommendations for a Strategic Implementation Plan, by end of summer 2011, on the basis of which initiatives will be put forward through appropriate institutional channels for the implementation of the pilot EIP. The Commission will then, and in principle before the end of 2011, present its views and proposals in a Communication to Council and Parliament for their political endorsement.</p>
<p>The Commission will seek to build synergies between the pilot EIP on Active and healthy Ageing and the 2012 European Year for Active Ageing. The European Year 2012 should ensure greater visibility for the EIP. On the other hand, the EIP, which will run until 2020, could be a good vehicle to implement some of the commitments undertaken by stakeholders during the 2012 European Year on Active Ageing and respond to the call of the Council for common principles for active ageing (EPSCO Council conclusions on active ageing adopted in 7 June 2010).</p>
<p>On the basis of the Council conclusions of 26 November 2010 and also taking into account the experience in setting up the present pilot EIP, the views of the stakeholders, and the evaluation of the pilot EIP later in the year, the Commission expects to launch a second wave of innovation partnerships by end of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000138"></a>

Clearly it is in the interest of public authorities that these converge towards a set of business practices that will deliver a sustainable basis for innovative goods and services.</p>
<p>Apple's behaviour could infringe EU rules if Apple were to implement anticompetitive agreements that foreclose competition or abuse a dominant position on the relevant market(s). As there are several platforms and a large number of devices that can provide similar functionalities, it is not clear that any one company, including Apple, has attained a dominant position at this stage.</p>

<p>(FR) A green common agricultural policy (CAP) is a key objective of the reform under way to better meet environmental challenges. The future CAP should make an important contribution to the management of natural resources, in particular with a view to supporting the EU’s international commitments. Indeed, the objectives to be achieved in terms of climate change and biodiversity are an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy, in which the CAP plays a full part.</p>
<p>In accordance, therefore, with the broad lines of the CAP reform project, set out in the Commission Communication of 18 November 2010<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the future CAP must meet, at the same time, the requirements of food security, management of natural resources and vitality of rural areas. As regards maintaining biodiversity and combating climate change, both the first pillar and the second pillar of the CAP must help to achieve this. The Commission proposes in particular a green component under the first pillar to accommodate the obligation for farmers to carry out actions such as, for example, permanent meadow upkeep, crop rotation, vegetation cover and environmental set-aside, and those provided for in Natura 2000 areas.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently looking at various possible ways of implementing this. If the green CAP is to be effective, it is essential to strike the right balance in terms of the cost/benefit of the measures concerned and to ensure that the direct payment management and control system does not become unwieldy. At the same time, green direct payments would go hand in hand with a redefinition of conditionality and appropriate rural development measures. An impact assessment is being carried out with a view to the presentation of legislative proposals by the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission will provide the European Parliament with a comprehensive reply to the Resolution on EU agriculture and international trade<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> referred to by the honourable Member in her question, in accordance with the rules in force concerning the follow up by the Commission regarding non-legislative Resolutions of the Parliament.</p>
<p>While it is a fact that trade liberalisation raises challenges for EU agriculture, it is important to highlight that trade agreements provide new opportunities to EU agriculture stemming from our partners' concessions and it would be wrong to simply portray increased trade openness as a mere lose-lose scenario for EU agriculture. In addition, the wider benefits potentially delivered by trade openings for the European economy as a whole need to be borne in mind.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue of trade negotiations with Mercosur, the negotiations on a EU - Mercosur Association Agreement have been re-launched in view of reaching a balanced and comprehensive agreement between the two regions, which would deepen relations and offer great political and economic benefits to both sides. The Commission is fully committed to pursue this goal. The re-launch of these negotiations has received support from both stakeholders and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Mercosur is a large and dynamic economy with a GDP growth rate of around 8% in 2010. An agreement with Mercosur would be the first comprehensive deal on trade for our South American partners. It would give EU exporters an edge over their competitors in the rest of the world by enshrining privileged access to a market of 260 million people of middle income in one region of the world where purchasing power is rising fastest.</p>
<p>In general, the very challenge when negotiating multilateral or bilateral trade agreements that impact EU agriculture is to strike the right balance between our offensive and our defensive interests in agriculture as well as between agriculture and other areas of our trade negotiations. The Commission is very conscious of this and will continue to pursue such a goal, in close cooperation with the Parliament and the Council, with respect to the range of ongoing talks to which the EU remains fully committed, whether in multilateral or in bilateral contexts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The EU has expressed its readiness to mobilise resources in support of the democratic transition in Egypt. This could include, among others, capacity building and technical assistance for election preparation, institution building as well as election observation. The development of the ongoing reforms in Egypt is in the hands of the Egyptian authorities and the Egyptian people. The Commission is ready to provide support, as soon as Egypt asks for it. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its interest in observing the Egyptian elections in the past. With the ongoing democratic reform, this issue is growing in importance. The EU will be ready to send a fully fledged, or a more limited electoral assessment or electoral expert’s mission if the Egyptian authorities invite us to do so.</p>
<p>The popular uprising of 25 January 2011 started thanks to the engagement of the youth and emerging political movements. The EU attaches great importance to working with these groups of civil society. For this reason EUR 2 million has been allocated from the Instrument for Stability for immediate support to the civil society organisations and civic movements. The main objective of the programme will be to increase their capacity to participate in the ongoing reform, create platforms for exchange of views, provide expertise and trainings and support public awareness. The programme will mobilise experts from Europe, including Central and Eastern Europe, as well as from the Arab region. Special attention will be paid to the role of women.</p>
<p>A civil society support package in the amount of EUR 17,7 million is also being launched locally in Cairo through the calls for proposals. Their timeframe is longer and the projects will start mostly around summer, hence their focus is adjusted to women rights, youth, children rights, media, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, combating torture, etc.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000147"></a>

<p>(EN) As stated in the White Paper on transport policy<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, further simplification of administrative procedures in force in maritime transport is still necessary to encourage that waterborne transport is used to its full potential.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Blue Belt pilot project, undertaken by the European Maritime Safety Agency in cooperation with customs authorities and a number of volunteering shipping companies and due for completion in 2011, will show to the customs authorities in Member States how EU monitoring capabilities developed by this Agency can help them in their daily task, and how usual administrative formalities can be eased, without reducing the level of compliance to the various legislations. Amongst the more than two hundred vessels which will participate to the pilot project a number are involved in deep sea operations.

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the recent, totally unacceptable incidents in the European Parliament. It is the primary responsibility of the Parliament and its Members to take the necessary actions and measures to prevent similar behaviour in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission has drafted a Code of Conduct for Commissioners which is stricter than its previous one and among the strictest codes currently in force. The Parliament has been consulted on the draft and the Commission will adopt the new Code as soon as possible taking into account the comments of the Parliament.</p>
<p>This shall not prevent the Commission and the Parliament from reflecting together how can be found the best possible standards for the members of all institutions with their respective roles and mandates. But it would be up to the Parliament to initiate the debate with rules it would envisage for Members of the Parliament. The Commission do not want to give the impression that the Commission tries to regulate the work of Members of the Parliament.</p>
<p>With regard to the Transparency Register, the honourable Member will be aware that a draft agreement on a joint transparency register of the Parliament and the Commission, prepared by a working group led by Parliament Vice-President Wallis and Commission Vice-President Šefčovič, is currently under examination in the Constitutional Affairs' (AFCO) Committee (President Casini report). The Commission and the Parliament have invited the Council to join the agreement and contacts are on-going in this regard.</p>
<p>Especially under the current circumstances, the Commission strongly recommend a quick adoption of the agreement as it is and plead not to delay its implementation by new legal and political discussions about the voluntary or mandatory character of the register. The discussions and especially a legislative process would take months and years before a register would see the light of the day.</p>
<p>The Commission and the Parliament must bear in mind that we do not need a register to ban behaviour which is most obviously unethical and possibly even criminal. It is for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), prosecutors and the Courts to enforce the laws which exist.</p>
<p>The contribution of the Transparency Register will be to provide information to citizens, civil servants and to all of us about all those organisations which are influencing the discussions in both our institutions.</p>
<p>All those who register − be they lobbyists, think tanks, NGOs or others – will provide information about their intentions, their finances and their main activities. They will subscribe to a code of conduct and a system of sanctions in case of breach of the rules. There are already today around 3,800 organisations in the current Commission register.</p>
<p>All those who will not be in the Transparency Register will have to be asked why they are not in and if they have anything to hide. And everyone should be more than prudent when dealing with such organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
