This will ensure that you are well prepared to support your country during its forthcoming accession to the European Union. You will be preparing yourselves to represent the interests of a full Member State of the European Union and of the citizens of your country here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the European Parliament has already ratified the Treaty of Accession. We hope that, on 1 July 2013, Croatia will become the 28th Member State of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This will be an historic day for Croatia. I believe it will also be an historic day for the European Union and for the Western Balkans as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that new colleagues from a country which is joining the EU are working with us here, first as observers and then later as full members, sends out a signal that the European Union as a concept for the cooperation of states and peoples across national borders has not lost any of its fascination, despite the crisis which we are discussing on a daily basis and which we will have to debate once again here today. There are still many countries which envy us our integration process. There are also peoples who want to join this community of nations. We should not see this as a burden, but as a great opportunity and as an affirmation of the concept of European integration. Therefore, I think it is an encouraging sign that in this situation, in which we are all thinking so often about the purpose of our European integration efforts, other nations want to join us. All of this is expressed symbolically by the presence of the new observers from Croatia. Once again, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you.</p>

However, in the current situation, it runs the risk of being misunderstood. It is about the greening of the tax system and, in particular, the energy tax system and the taxes on petrol and diesel as vehicle fuels. In this context, there will definitely be concerns in some countries that this report will lead to vehicle fuels, and particularly diesel, becoming more expensive, against the background of fuel prices that are already very high. It is true that the report makes it clear that this is not intended to happen today, but at a later date. The report also states, although somewhat vaguely, that there will be compensation for increases in diesel prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the interest of Ms Lulling and of our common environmental awareness and policy making, we should defer this report, so that we can look again at how we can clarify the situation with regard to diesel in particular. This is why I am tabling this motion. I understand that Ms Lulling is sceptical, but it would be in her interest and in that of her report if we could make the wording clearer and then submit it to Parliament at a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last night, the Argentinean Government announced that it intends to expropriate the majority stake held by the Spanish company Repsol in the YPF energy company. This announcement gives cause for grave concern. YPF is an important European Union investment in Argentina. A takeover sends a very negative signal to international investors and could seriously harm the business environment in Argentina. The measure creates legal insecurity for all European Union and foreign firms in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also alarmed to note that the President referred in her speech to investments in other sectors, such as telecoms and banking. This announcement adds to a number of problematic decisions taken by Argentina over the past few years in the areas of import restrictions and investment policy. The government of Argentina must ensure compliance with its international commitments on the treatment and protection of investments originating from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this announcement, we have decided to postpone the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee which had been scheduled to take place on Friday this week. This matter will also be discussed at next Monday’s Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg. The Spanish Government has our full backing in this matter. The European Union delegation in Argentina has conveyed these concerns to the government of Argentina. The announcement was only made last night, but the Commission and the External Action Service are studying the Argentinean draft measure so as to determine the next steps. All possible options are being analysed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title14"></a><a name="creitem14"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Richard Howitt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– Mr President, our debate on the annual human rights report this year – although delayed – comes at an even more important time, because it allows us to make an input into the strategic review, which represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make human rights even more central to what we are about in the European Union. If human rights are indeed a silver thread, the review must demonstrate that there is a silver bullet.</p>
<p class="contents">In our vote tomorrow, we shall ask Baroness Ashton to appoint a special representative to ensure that Europe’s voice on human rights is heard clearly on the world stage and that human rights are put on an equal footing with other foreign policy working groups in the Council. Indeed, we warmly thank her for adopting these proposals in the course of our joint discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall ask for a timetable to be set so that human rights focal points are designated in all our delegations worldwide. We ask for human rights organisations to be treated as partners and not simply as agents of delivery. We ask for concrete mechanisms so that allegations of human rights violations within Europe do not compromise our ability to promote human rights outside. Although it is always right to seek to protect those whose lives are at risk, there must be a major increase in the transparency of EU human rights policies, as accountability for those who abuse human rights can only be achieved if there is also accountability for those of us who seek to promote them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, we name six EU countries which have failed to legislate for the International Criminal Court. We say that the European Neighbourhood Policy is wrong to tolerate thirteen countries which have failed to either sign or to ratify the UN Protocol against Torture, and we name my own country – the United Kingdom – which has shamefully obstructed EU ratification of the EU Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To the High Representative: I understand why you advocated ‘more for more’ in the wake of the Arab Spring, but we were negotiating improved trade terms with Gaddafi just four weeks before we started dropping bombs on him. Today, we ask you to address the harder question of ‘less for less’. Suspending the EU’s international agreements is too blunt an instrument, and one which is too rarely used. We ask for country-by-country human rights benchmarks and indices and for mechanisms to enable their use for a real escalation of response.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have long argued that speaking up for human rights is more important than staying silent for the sake of European unity. This is why we should congratulate Belgium and Austria for voting for the inquiry into settlements in the Palestinian territories, and why we introduced an amendment maintaining support for the investigation of war crimes in Gaza. Whilst sincerely welcoming the cooperation of the shadow rapporteurs in not-always-easy circumstances, I regret that there was a left/right split in the votes at committee on this and on the issues of women’s rights, on discrimination against <span class="italic">all</span> religions and on justice for the victims of extraordinary rendition.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that tomorrow, all of us will vote together for human rights. In this report, too, I have particularly examined the issues of social media and of business and human rights. Just as there is a constant race for new technologies, there is a race between those harnessing new media for the purpose of liberation and those who seek to use it for repression. I do not hesitate to say that Vodafone must learn from doing Mubarak’s bidding or to give due credit to Google for refusing to be complicit with censorship in China. I hope to come back to all these issues in my report on corporate responsibility later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call for a new human rights tsar to be appointed in order to put Europe on an equal footing with the United States, where the post of Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy and Human Rights exists; mechanisms to ensure full compliance with human rights by the European Union within our own borders; concrete measures to demonstrate that we have learnt from past mistakes from before the Arab Spring; and an understanding that freedom of expression has a new meaning in a new media age. These are some of our key conclusions this year, and I commend them to the House.</p>

This is a mark of recognition of the importance of integrating human rights effectively into development cooperation, in keeping with the rationale from the Lisbon Treaty of pursuing a consistent foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I welcome the new approach featured in the joint communication on human rights and democracy at the heart of the European Union’s external actions. This is an integrated human rights strategy covering the whole gamut of EU policies. However, a great deal still needs to be done to make the strategy a reality. Budget support should be linked more closely to the situation regarding human rights and governance in the beneficiary countries, and I believe that detailed criteria must be set out for granting this support.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is a difficult subject to raise at a time of economic crisis, another key aspect is to increase the funding for European mechanisms for supporting democracy and human rights. They provide the EU with practical tools for promoting democracy and human rights in third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, since 1983, when the European Parliament began adopting an annual report and resolution on human rights, this House has done more than any EU institution to focus on such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">While we may sometimes disagree about how best to champion respect for human rights globally, we stand united in our aim: to see a freer world, where people’s dignity is respected – wherever they may be from – and for the EU, and the External Action Service in particular, to play a key role in supporting people’s struggles for their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to turn to the report by Richard Howitt which is before us today. First of all, I want to congratulate him for achieving consensus across the political spectrum on this report. I believe it is essential reading for me, my colleagues in the Commission and my colleagues in the Council. The very first paragraph of the report is about coherence between the internal and external policies of the European Union – one of the main themes from the Communication of December. It is a particularly important theme for Parliament this week, since on Thursday, it will hear statements from the Council and the Commission on the European Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, ‘coherence’ might sound dry, but this really does mean that human rights can be woven into everything we do, in Europe and beyond. It means making sure that people everywhere benefit from the same universal rights, regardless of who they are or where they live.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also highlights the importance of accountability and the importance of our work in developing, in serious situations, the accountability that we have. I will pick out two themes that, in a sense, are very important both for coherence and accountability. Firstly, the role of women, especially as yesterday, I met Michelle Bachelet to talk about the role of women and to sign agreements with UN Women on how to go forward and support women across the world. Secondly – especially at the present time – discrimination against people of faith, including Christians, and those who have other beliefs. Tolerance is at the heart of the European Union, and that is why we need to strengthen our policy on the freedom of religion or belief, which is fundamental to a free society.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must work continuously for the widest possible ratification, acceptance and approval of, and accession to, the Rome Statute. That work is progressing. So far, we have signed three bilateral agreements, including ICC clauses, and initialled another three, and we are negotiating another 15. We have also included ICC clauses in many of our ENP action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the power to promote human rights by placing countries and regimes on a scale stretching between engagement and isolation and using human rights as a method of measuring how we should address our relationships with different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights have never been more important than they are now, nor indeed have they ever driven so many changes. If we simply look, for example, at what is happening throughout the Middle East and North Africa, men and women, young and old, representing the whole of society, have found the courage to assert their fundamental human rights. Some have been prepared to give their lives for freedom, dignity and a better future. I should like to pay tribute to all of them now.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes that they have brought, as Mr Howitt has said, required the EU to develop a new response to a changing neighbourhood. I believe we have risen to that challenge. Human rights and deep democracy are at the heart of our new approach, and I believe our partnerships with our neighbours are stronger and healthier as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work at the UN Human Rights Council has also helped to reinforce and support these positive and domestically-driven developments. At the 19th session, which concluded on 28 March, the European Union resolution on Syria was adopted with a record vote of 41 in favour, out of a possible 47. Our resolution on human rights in Burma/Myanmar was adopted by consensus, as was the resolution on freedom of religion or belief.</p>
<p class="contents">The session was a success for the rights of individuals, who too often find themselves marginalised and ostracised. The successful panel on ‘Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity’ was a remarkable achievement, for which all credit is due to South Africa’s leadership, together with Ban Ki-moon. It is unacceptable that 80 states still criminalise same-sex relations between consenting adults, and that seven even foresee the death penalty. This is totally incompatible with international human rights law.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very, very important that Barbara Lochbihler and Laima Andrikienė were able to attend the Human Rights Council, where they addressed EU Heads of Mission and met with a wide range of international representatives. This is just another example of the important role of the European Parliament and the important way in which it is seen to promote human rights in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My communication of last December was designed as a contribution to what is an ongoing discussion within and between EU institutions on a more effective and comprehensive approach to human rights and democracy. Now that there has been time to consider what I put forward, I look forward to working with you on the shape of our future strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As I confirmed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 20 March, work is in hand to pave the way for the appointment of a Special Representative for Human Rights as part of a package to put into practice the joint communication. It is important that this person be someone with a strong track record on international human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as was discussed at the ‘Gymnich’ meeting of foreign ministers, we want to agree a political declaration on what we want to achieve, and we want an action plan on how to put this into practice. This will bring together new initiatives as well as others that we have already launched. I am happy to confirm that the network of human rights focal points is nearly complete: 116 EU Delegations now have someone, and many have two, in both their political and cooperation sections.</p>
<p class="contents">On all of this, I want to work closely with the honourable Members. The review of EU human rights policy was first announced in this House. The appointment of a Special Representative was championed by this House. It is therefore natural that ongoing work on human rights and democracy should be in full cooperation with this House. I have written to the Chair of the Human Rights Sub-Committee to ask her to work with me to ensure the fullest possible participation in the drafting of the Joint Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">To end as I began, I pay tribute to Mr Howitt for his work and I pay tribute to the European Parliament for its continuous work in support of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is justified, however, because we are considering this report in conjunction with the new European policy on democratisation and human rights, which follows from the communication to Parliament by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, in December of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">There were many developments in the field of human rights in 2010. At the same time, while adopting this report, we are bound to be affected by the impressions made on us by the Arab Spring, which prompted us to revise our view on supporting the processes of democratisation and respect for human rights. It seems to me that the synergy of the Arab Spring experience provides a new approach to support the processes of democratisation, as does the new approach that stems from the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the opportunity to comment on the contents of the report prepared by Richard Howitt. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent cooperation. In particular, I want to emphasise the critical reference to human rights violations in Belarus, including the rights of convicted persons. This has also been discussed here in Parliament: persons sentenced to death are entitled to decent treatment, and to a fair trial. In addition, their families have the right to information about their relatives and the right to a dignified burial.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I also note with satisfaction the positive development in Belarus involving the release of two political prisoners, Andrei Sannikov and Dmitry Bondarenko. Also encouraging is the most recent Euronest resolution adopted in Baku, which relates to human rights in Partnership Countries, including Ukraine. I welcome the very positive reference to the establishment of a European fund for democracy. This is an instrument which will support democratic processes, both before, during and after the process of transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deplores the heightened persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians, across the world. We cannot tolerate the burning of places of worship, murder, or any other type of persecution of Christians and other religions in the world. The report emphasises the special role of the Eastern Partnership Countries Ombudsmen Cooperation Programme, an initiative by the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection of the Republic of Poland and the Mediator of the French Republic. This promotes good practices which will help to foster respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, reference should also be made to corporate social responsibility, especially in the context of human rights, and most particularly in the context of trade relations with countries that are neighbours of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now need to learn the lessons of our times and engage in a little self-criticism. We need to show that we have learned from our mistakes. Unfortunately, the West and the Member States of the European Union have actively or passively supported dictatorships in North Africa for years in the name of an artificial stability. It has now become clear, and I think that we all understand, that long-term stability is impossible without respect for human rights and democracy. If we really want the European Union to be a reliable player on the international stage, it is high time that we stopped applying double standards to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All aid offered to third countries should be accompanied by effective pressure to make real improvements in this sector. Within this framework, the human rights clause in trade agreements between the Union and third countries is an important instrument and suitable use should be made of it, while it should generally be made clear that the ‘more for more’ approach also means ‘less for less’. It is also important for the Member States to present a united front at the UN and in other important international fora. We therefore welcome the adoption of general guidelines on statements by the European Union at international fora. However, we must, at the same time, repeat our call for regular consultation between ambassadors of EU Member States, in order to improve coordination in the common endeavour to promote and defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two final points: first of all, the need to defend religious freedom is self-evident. However, we must fight for the freedom of all religious groups without exception, not only Christian groups, as called for by certain groups in this Parliament. Finally, I wish to comment on the question of women’s reproductive rights. A woman’s right over her body is a very important human right. It is a right to dignity and freedom. For all of us for whom freedom is a non-negotiable right, a woman’s right over her body is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that reaching agreement on political and moral matters on all sides of the spectrum of the European Parliament is a challenging and difficult task.</p>
<p class="contents">The report raises the question of whether human rights have become a central issue for the EU and whether we have succeeded in mainstreaming them as a pivotal aspect of foreign policy. At the same time, the question remains as to whether human rights have become a common denominator in a political and moral consensus across the political spectrum of this House and of the European Union.</p>

Yes, I believe that the challenge of the future lies in our ability to identify and tackle less obvious, vague and elusive – not to say subtle – violations of human rights, such as selective justice, politicised trials and endemic corruption – all of which undermine any kind of fair and equal treatment of people – as well as illegitimate surveillance, abuse of psychiatry, government sponsored and state-coordinated campaigns of defamation, and slander and blackmail against dissenting individuals and human rights defenders.</p>

<p class="contents">This came in a debate on human rights and in a week when there was a <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> in Guinea-Bissau, a country much closer to the European Union, which has served as a platform for arms and drug trafficking into the EU and which received no more than a mere press release from her office, when it deserved more; a country from which our EU delegation was withdrawn and where Baroness Ashton has still not reinstated that delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a West African country that is at risk of becoming a failed state – if it is not one already – and I wish there were as much urgency in dealing with these issues as there has been in dealing with Repsol, at a time when the EU has vessels flying German flags sailing through Cypriot ports and exporting arms to Syria, at a time when the EU has companies selling Internet censorship and monitoring software to dictatorial regimes, and at a time when international agreements with only the vaguest of references to human rights continue to be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the same kind of readiness to accede to our requests to punish these companies as there has been to come out in Repsol’s defence. There has been enough playing around with human rights. Let us make the new strategies public. Let us be consistent in how we deal with the internal and external dimensions of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the report by Mr Howitt, whom I thank for his collaboration and the extremely concrete and practical suggestions he has included therein, is a valuable tool for the Commission’s future action. As shadow rapporteur for Mr Howitt and as rapporteur for the political and strategic review of fundamental rights in Europe, I hope that the farces can end and the real work can begin. For this I am ready, Baroness Ashton, but for the rest, I am not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly evident in the recognition of the issue of freedom of religion. Religious freedom is an inalienable principle of human rights. Its fundamental nature is confirmed by the UN and Council of Europe conventions. Widespread violations of this right, particularly apparent against Christians, constitute a dramatic violation of human rights worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">One year after the beginning of the Arab Spring, there is an increasing number of real threats to the entire Christian community in the Middle East. We must constantly remind our political partners in the region of this. It would be tragic if Christians were to become the first victim of the democratisation process that was so yearned for in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot agree with the criticism of France and the United Kingdom regarding the European Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. There is a danger that this action could result in a conflict of jurisdiction between the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg, and it may also result in uncontrolled expansion of the competence of European courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The report should not contain any references to so-called reproductive health. Such provisions are a pretext for the promotion and financing of abortions all over the world, even in countries where this procedure is illegal. This is a huge abuse of trust of the citizens and the Member States, who never granted the European Commission any such competence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Take, for example, the images of the sign of the cross carved into the hand and wrist of a 27-year-old married Egyptian woman who managed to escape her kidnappers and torturers.</p>
<p class="contents">To my knowledge, the High Representative responded on 9 December 2011 to previous questions about this extremely serious violation of the legal rights of Egyptian Christians. She mentioned then the difficulty in proving the charges of kidnappings, abuse and forced conversions. At the same time, the High Representative wrote that she would keep urging the Egyptian authorities to take action regarding these heartbreaking cases. Madam High Representative, I would very much like to hold you to this pledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The poignant programmes from an evangelical broadcaster in my country, which are supported by actual evidence, give you every reason to do so. Speaking of evidence, the oldest and largest Egyptian human rights organisation, Euhro, officially reports that, in the last 10 months, over 1 500 Christian parents have come knocking on its doors regarding the abduction of their daughters. In 80% of the cases, this concerns underage girls, only 10 of whom have been returned so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam High Representative, I have seen images of a married Egyptian couple watching a video, alongside their tearful nine-year-old daughter, of their 15-year-old daughter Nabila who has been kidnapped. ‘If you want me to come home, you must first convert to Islam!’ implores Nabila. This new, publicly available evidence about the kidnappings and forced conversions of Egyptian girls and women calls for appropriate action. Continue to exert European pressure on the Egyptian authorities to investigate violations of the law, so that we can inspire confidence in the legal system for the country’s significant Christian minority.</p>

<p class="contents">This report is important because it shows a strong desire to make progress on the demands that Parliament and, more generally, the European Union, ought to have with regard to human rights. In particular, it stresses the need to bring into line the internal and external policies of the European Union in this area, and we know that there is every reason to do so. For, before lecturing the whole world, we must start to effectively put our own house in order and hypocrisy is often to be found in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The report places much emphasis on the need to effectively implement the clauses on democracy and human rights, which should not be there just to ease our consciences. They serve no real purpose if they are systematically and constantly sacrificed on the altar of economic liberalism. There too, in reality, we know what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with all of the gold stars which our rapporteur has awarded, Baroness Ashton, and I do apologise, in particular concerning the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>

I would therefore like to focus on an element that is not mentioned in the report and that is the situation in South Africa, principally the murders of white farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa faces a huge crime problem. All ethnic groups are affected by that insecurity, but the systematic nature of attacks on white farmers and their families is very obvious and therefore deserves our special attention. In the past fifteen years, 3 000 farmers have been murdered in South Africa, often in horrific circumstances, and even children have not been spared.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very vulnerable section of the population, not only because it is a very small minority, but also because of its geographical distribution and the extreme remoteness of many farms. The American NGO Genocide Watch has warned of several factors indicating that this is a potential genocide in the making. This is not just part of the existing culture of crime; this is a campaign targeted against farmers and it is likely that the land reform which is being planned will result in a witch-hunt that will escalate the violence further.</p>
<p class="contents">We will then have even more murders, even more farmers will leave South Africa and then we will reach a situation reminiscent of that of Zimbabwe. It is therefore high time that the silence around this situation was broken and I therefore urge you, Baroness Ashton, to strongly condemn the violence against farmers and suspend aid to South Africa if the country fails to take effective action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I should particularly like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for the statement you made on the situation that has arisen in the Repsol company before we began our debate on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">You said a great deal in a short time. You mentioned a wrong decision; a threat to investments and the future of Argentina; the need to comply with the commitments that were made; the measures you took to include this issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council; the postponement of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; as well as analysing possible measures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Howitt’s report, Madam President, I believe it is a reasonable report in general terms, although clearly some matters still need to be addressed, such as the decision to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza – which is a request that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) obviously cannot accept, as the rapporteur is well aware – and Mr Howitt’s position on Colombia, which is quite simply delusional.</p>
<p class="contents">That amendment was already rejected in the vote taken in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and, for us, at a time when we are waiting for the Multipart Trade Agreement between Peru, Colombia and the European Union to be ratified, it is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of our human rights policy, one with which Parliament has an irrevocable and unquestionable commitment. I am referring to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will vote on this issue in a resolution, and we would like the selection procedure for this individual to be objective, Baroness Ashton, so that the person appointed can truly have the merit and capability to fulfil this important role to the high level it certainly deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is impossible to comment on all its important aspects, so I will focus on women’s rights. Women all over the world are the victims of discrimination and inequality. They are humiliated and the victims of violence. Although gender equality is reflected in the EU priorities on human rights, the treatment of women as second class citizens continues to be tolerated and insufficient action is taken to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to be used to combat all aspects and forms of violence against women, including physical, psychological, social, economic and political violence. Women’s rights should be made a priority subject in negotiations with all candidate countries. It is necessary to constantly remind the Turkish authorities that the continuing scale of violence against women – including honour killings and early and forced marriages – are a crucial obstacle to Turkey’s accession to the European Union. The prevention of selective abortion is also important, as is the prevention of female infanticide and the genital mutilation of girls, the promotion of health education and programmes on sexual and reproductive rights and health, all of which are considered a priority in the development policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the European Commission and Member States to address violence against women on an international level and the gender dimension of human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is taking an international lead on the abolition of the death penalty, but a reply to a written question that I put to the High Representative has not reassured me that EU funding for a regional partnership in central Asia and neighbouring countries against drug trafficking avoids indirect facilitation of the execution by Iran of drug smugglers. I have had the chance to mention this to her and I will take it further.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud her work on amending the Torture Goods Regulation last year to require export controls on pharmaceutical drugs, like anaesthetics, which are being outrageously misused in lethal cocktails for executions, principally in the United States.</p>

In fact, some have already been there for three months, and it looks as if they may be forced to stay there for much longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The camp is insufficient to accommodate this number of people.

I must admit that I have very serious doubts about that.</p>
<p class="contents">What is much worse is the political correctness that weighs down this report. For example, it quite rightly highlights the precarious situation of religious minorities and women in Muslim countries, as it does the paradox of the so-called Arab Spring, but it studiously avoids using the word ‘Islam’ to indicate the problem. Islam, however, lies at the heart of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would be able to accept the paragraph where the EU is called upon to organise mass rescue operations at sea for the benefit of illegal immigrants if there were also a call for those illegal immigrants to be sent back to their country of origin.

Secondly, I would like to say that we often have a problem when it comes to putting into practice the human rights policies that we largely agree on. Therefore, I am pleased that there is obviously a plan to appoint an EU Special Representative on Human Rights as part of the European External Action Service and to set up a special department for religious freedom. We must make sure that this is one of the major aspects of a preventive human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the current situation in Egypt and the fact that the Christian minorities there are very much afraid – it is said that 1 million Christians are preparing to leave – and given the constitutional process in Egypt and the 15 million Copts who established a <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> with the Muslims which lasted centuries and now live in completely different circumstances, it is clear that major and dramatic developments lie ahead and that we must begin taking action today, particularly as these circumstances could lead to high levels of migration. This factor also needs to be taken into consideration and we must not be afraid of saying that the persecution of Christians is also a difficult issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is also important for us to check our trade agreements. I am grateful that the association agreement with Ukraine has not yet been signed. Opposition politicians are still in prison and the leader of the opposition, who is seriously ill, is being pressured to submit to interrogation and is being refused painkilling medication until she is prepared to continue being interrogated, which means that this is being used as an instrument of torture, as investigations carried out by doctors have recently established. It is clear that this imposes restrictions on all our practical and strategic considerations and that, despite all these considerations, we must not forget our principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I second his call for colleagues on the right in this House to reconsider their vote on re-tabled amendments on LGBT, people’s human rights, women’s sexual and reproductive health, European accountability as regards torture renditions and secret prisons and war crimes in Gaza. I believe we need to be coherent and consistent in order to ensure that the promotion of human rights and democracy is indeed at the core of our external action.</p>
<p class="contents">We have lessons to learn from the Arab Spring and we need to put an end to the support for oppressive regimes under the pretext of security, stability and economic interests. Take Ethiopia for example: an oppressive regime that is a main beneficiary of EU development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">‘More for more’ must also mean ‘less for less’, as we say in this report. This means that we need smart, more active support for civil society. All actors of democratisation must ensure that security, trade and development and other policies take account of efforts in human rights and democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">All levels of EU staff, including staff in the EU delegations and the heads of delegation, must have adequate training in human rights. The new strategy must bear scrutiny from Parliament, the media and civil society. Country strategies, papers and human rights benchmarks must provide for timely consultation with civil society and must be made public.</p>

Last week, I heard a very intelligent statement made by Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuri Luzenko in prison. They said that the basis for ensuring good human rights standards is judicial reform. We should discuss judicial reform before discussing other reforms in all countries where we note violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am very pleased that the report refers to a European fund for democracy. My only fear is that this fund will be mired in bureaucracy before it comes into being. We must act quickly in the case of Belarus, and we must take decisions concerning North Africa. A little more dynamism and a little less bureaucracy are called for, and we should say so.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another issue that I consider to be extremely important.

The report brings all aspects of the topic into the context of the policy pursued by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the fight against the global economic crisis, high unemployment and inflation, it is particularly easy to lose sight of fundamental values such as human rights. Nevertheless, the values encompassed by this broadly defined term must always be respected by third countries cooperating with the European Union in various ways. Economic gain – although important and impossible to ignore – cannot be bought with consent to violation of the fundamental rights of individuals and of society that are included in the catalogue of values adopted in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, this problem is particularly pertinent, especially since we are conducting both commercial and accession negotiations with countries that do not always share our interpretation of the concept of human rights or that knowingly violate them. The European Union cannot assume the role of global guardian of human rights, but in cases where we do have effective instruments for that purpose available to us, and especially in the context of cooperation with third countries, protection of the values which we all advocate here in Europe should always be our utmost priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still a lot of work to do and we encourage you, Baroness Ashton, to resume work on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to come back to is the European Neighbourhood Policy and the ‘more for more’ principle. We have complete confidence in the Council, the Commission and your services, but nevertheless, we fear that this new neighbourhood policy sometimes remains just as blind as the previous one with regard to the situation in the countries where we have interests, in cases when they are allies. That is why we want to make it operable. Richard Howitt put it very well. We want a method, we want criteria, we want to measure improvements in democracy and human rights and we really want to see some genuine ‘more for more’, which is both measurable and has teeth. I believe that it is absolutely essential and that it represents a genuine will for change, something which Parliament will affirm when it votes on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we would like to see the Council and the Commission performing the same role. You are responsible for this, Baroness Ashton, and that is where the significance of today’s debate lies. I would like to touch on a few specific points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the persecution of Christians. You are right, of course, Ms De Keyser. We also support freedom of conscience and of religion for Muslims and agnostics. However, Christians all over the world are being persecuted in a very specific way and Europe, as a primarily Christian continent, must be seen to be protecting Christians throughout the world in a very specific way. That is our duty, but it does not mean that we are neglecting anyone else. I cannot accept it when you say that we must do something for homosexuals – I am also in favour of this – but we are not allowed to mention Christians. The specific target group of our human rights policy is Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would just like to say that we need to have the same standards for everyone. We must not simply criticise small states for breaches of human rights and make an exception for the large ones, such as China and Russia. We need to apply the same strict standards to the large countries as we do to the small ones, even if this has an impact on many of our economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that it is crucial that human rights are not misused for ideological purposes. I am in favour of defending the human rights of all people and all groups. However, misusing human rights in order to impose certain socio-political ideas puts human rights at risk and is not worthy of the human rights activities of this House.</p>

<p class="contents">There are two issues in this report that I specifically want to address. First of all, the importance of the EU seeking accountability for breaches of international law, to which Baroness Ashton has already referred. In this respect, I want to offer my full support for Amendment 4 in relation to Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. As I have said previously in this House, I believe that the EU must demonstrate coherence between its policies and policy resolutions, on the one hand, and our external and bilateral arrangements, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to raise the issue of LGBT rights, and specifically the issue of gender identity. I specifically want to support Amendments 7 and 8, which I believe would strengthen the report in this regard. I support the call for the withdrawal of gender identity from the list of mental and behavioural disorders. It is unacceptable that transgender people have to be diagnosed with a mental disorder in order to have their identity recognised and have a passport issued in their new identity. That is a complete violation of the rights of transgender people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This measure goes against international law and the principle of legal certainty that affects all Europeans. I welcome your response and, once again, I thank you for your words, Baroness Ashton.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to talk about the Howitt report. Articles 3 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union show very clearly that human rights are an extremely important part of the EU’s external relations. That is because the rule of law and human rights are a constituent part, so to speak, of this Union and its Member States, but also because in today’s world, the international community as a whole considers that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that defending them can no longer be hindered by the old principle of non-interference in Member States’ internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we shall vote on tomorrow shows how important human rights are for Parliament; this can be clearly seen, I believe, from the Sakharov Prize that we created in this House many years ago, and also from the support we are giving to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights is a highly topical issue. This can be seen from the brand new role being created, which will be responsible for protecting human rights, and from the changes and revolutions that broke out last year in the Arab world – one of the main goals of which was to recover human dignity and respect for human rights. Baroness Ashton, we must all do our utmost – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – so that those political processes can consolidate the noble aspirations for which they were initiated, and so that the expectation of freedom, pluralism, tolerance and respect for minorities is not jeopardised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has quite rightly proposed that control over respect for human rights and democratisation in third-country actions should be at the heart of its foreign policy. However, it should not turn a blind eye when, within the European Union itself, there are countries, such as Cyprus, where human rights are being infringed by the occupying Turkish forces with impunity. The European Union should impose clauses protecting and applying human rights in all its trade and sectoral agreements with third countries. It should impose sanctions in order to eliminate discrimination against women and minorities. It should put a stop to the persecution of parliamentarians, trade union activists and journalists in Turkey. It should combat impunity by making use of the International Criminal Court. It should use education to build a real culture of respect for human rights. Finally, it should strengthen the role of Parliament, accountability and transparency and find effective mechanisms for applying human rights everywhere.</p>

I am particularly in favour of an approach that is critical but, at the same time, constructive, regarding the strengthening of policies for the promotion of the human rights of women, who all too often represent a minority that is weak and lacking guarantees, even though, in many rural areas of the world, women are the heart of the economy and are the main source of income for the family.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must strengthen cooperation with those international organisations that deal with this issue, through a targeted funding policy, such as that of the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence against Women.</p>
<p class="contents">Any form of discrimination and violence against women cannot be tolerated or be justified on religious, political or cultural grounds.

I have tabled a written statement along with my fellow Members, Mr Casini, Ms Záborská, and Mr Takkula, to highlight the rights of the unborn, the many children who are not born because pregnancy is often accompanied by social and economic hardship that does not allow the woman to bring it to fruition.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights of the unborn, not only of women – first and foremost to see the light of day, to come into this world, to have a life – rights with which Europe does not concern itself. My written statement was rejected by the Presidency, saying that this is not an issue we can deal with. I would like to ask how many years, how many decades, how many centuries it is going to take in Europe for us to be able to consider the possibility of simply discussing the rights of the unborn child and then to recognise natural rights that are often denied on such a vast scale, here in Europe, even to a creature who is simply waiting, asking only to come into this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would urge EPP Members and others in this Parliament who voted against the part that was already in the report to vote in favour of these amendments, because the issue at stake is our common human rights. It is about the European Charter of Fundamental Rights – which I hope all of you subscribe to – which makes clear that discrimination is not part of what we should have in the European Union.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, the honourable Members have ranged across a whole, important set of issues that fall under the universality of human rights. There are many, many points that we can reflect upon. Let me, in the short time I have, try and pick up on a few of these.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, may I say how pleased I am that Mr Sannikov and Mr Bondarenko have been released from prison in Belarus. We are in touch, and I hope that we may be seeing an opportunity with Belarus. This shows the strength of the European Union; it shows the importance of being decisive in what we do, and it shows more than anything that standing together is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of honourable Members have rightly raised the importance of faith, belief, conviction; the ability to worship and exercise belief, faith or none. I agree with all the concerns that have been raised about the importance of making sure that this is a core part of the work that we do on human rights. This is why we will dedicate a chapter in the annual report specifically to that, so that it becomes part of our human rights work but is highlighted appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear what a number of colleagues have said about the situation in Egypt, and we will continue to keep a watchful eye on how this is evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Donskis talked about the subtle undermining of human rights. The challenge is to make sure that we focus not just on the most obvious ways, for example, the abolition of the death penalty (which is, as you know, something I consider to be a fundamental part of the work that we do), but also on the ways in which people are prevented from exercising their rights in more subtle ways. These two things are very important. They lead to that lack of dignity and respect that is core and fundamental to how we feel.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tavares, I just want to say to you that my message on Argentina had nothing to do with this debate. I was asked by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra if I would say something before the debate began about Argentina because I cannot be here tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you about the terrible situation in Guinea-Bissau. It is why, even before the coup last Thursday, I put out a statement and called on all parties to respect the legitimate government, and I have been very strong in my condemnation of the coup. Those who are in prison should be released immediately, and we have suspended most of our aid to Guinea-Bissau.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, looking at how to make sure we can continue to give direct support to the people. But we will not support an illegitimate government, and I completely agree with you on that – but please do not think that I was trying to bring one issue into another. I really was not. It was a separate discussion before the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, too, that honourable Members have been in the forefront of wanting to see a special representative and, as you know, I am currently working on the mandate for that person. We are looking for someone of enormous integrity and with great ability in this field. It will be an important role, and the appointee will need to have a good relationship with this House. This is something we want to continue to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very pleased to see that so many people mentioned the issues of women’s rights and the importance of continuing to support women, especially women going through extreme circumstances of horror and terror, but also women trying to engage in the political and economic lives of their countries. Very simplistically, we know that when women are engaged in society, societies are richer in every possible sense: economically, socially and politically, and the issue of forced marriages is one that affects many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was a minister for human rights in the country I came from, I did legislation on forced marriages there. This is something we need to take seriously everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ludford, I have already said before that we will look into that, but you know that I am deeply concerned about the use of the death penalty everywhere, especially, as I said to you earlier, over the 100 instances of the death penalty in Iran so far this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson, you have been a champion on the issue of Camp Ashraf because of your concern for the people there. We are still in touch with Martin Kobler and are still pushing hard on Member States, and I need the help of MEPs to make sure that we can resettle as many people as possible. This is crucial, but we are also offering to support the UN financially in moving forward on this. So, in a sense, the more I can rely on help from this House, the more I will be able to do. But you know how much I am concerned about this and how engaged we are on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of South Africa on the point that was raised, we have agreed to launch a human rights dialogue with South Africa where we can raise a number of different issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Ms Gomes said about the importance of meeting with human rights activists. I try to do that in every country I visit in order to listen to them and hear from them about the situation on the ground and the realities of the life that they lead. I support fully the rights of lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual people, and this should be fully reflected in everything we do on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Such rights are universal. In terms of how we work with different countries, I have talked before about the spectrum of engagement to isolation and the importance of ensuring that human rights is one of the indicators of how we work with countries. We are often, as the honourable Members know, trying to work with people in countries in order to support them while also trying to isolate and put pressure on their governments. The spectrum really matters in that we do not abandon people who are desperately trying to obtain their rights, but we engage where we can. On that spectrum of engagement to isolation, where engagement can be more effective (and it very often is), we need to make sure that we are there, willing to put the pressure on to try and make the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is a bureaucratic one: benchmarking. We are working now on how to develop the methodology for this. We want to measure the performance, as a number of honourable Members have indicated. There is quite a long way to go, but the action plan may also be an opportunity for us to examine.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is to thank Richard Howitt again for the work he has done on this very important report. I know his personal conviction and commitment to this, and I pay tribute to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I pay due credit to the EU’s positions in the United Nations, including on the death penalty, reflected in this debate and achieved under her leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to repeat my thanks for all the compliments given in the debate – not least from the shadows – and place on record my support for Mr Grzyb’s proposal for business and human rights to be integrated in EU trade policy. I welcome both his and other contributions from the EPP Group: from Mr Brok, Ms Matera, Mr Kukan and Ms Gál. They have shown that we can have cross-party consensus on the issues in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">To Ms Ludford, I would say that the regular reports on the internal Council meetings on accession to the European Convention on Human Rights discussed both in this Parliament and in the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe make quite clear the UK’s opposition, and I am sorry that once again, her party are making excuses for conservative anti-human rights positions. I hope that may change later his week, but I am not holding my breath.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, my thanks go to all who have quoted from my report stating that I am against double standards in human rights – they are right, and I have to say that goes for this debate; to Mr Claeys, who would win greater respect if he condemned both black and white murders in South Africa; and to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who appears to support the rule of law in Argentina but not Colombia. Whilst I and my text strongly agree with the concerns expressed by MEPs Szymański, Belder, Kowal, Provera and Posselt on the persecution of Christians, it is important to say that this did not start with the Arab Spring. I hope they will join with me in condemning discrimination against all religions and beliefs in all countries at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the contributions from my colleagues, Ms De Keyser and Ms Costello, on LGBT rights. It is wrong that homosexuality could be classified as a disease, and I hope that MEPs will vote for Amendments 7 and 8, which I have tabled to condemn this. I welcome the contributions from Mr Tavares and Ms Miranda on indigenous peoples’ rights, and I indicate to you my support for your oral amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if High Representative Ashton’s arithmetic is correct, I have served as the 28th annual human rights rapporteur of this European Parliament since the first direct elections. I would like to thank colleagues sincerely for giving me the privilege of undertaking this role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union’s commitment to supporting democracy and human rights in its external policies is affirmed by the EUR 1.1 billion committed to the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (2007-2013). While the EU’s contribution is certainly important, so is our interest to ensure that tax-payers’ money properly serves citizens of recipient countries and the EU’s interests and values. Our past experience shows that EU funds allocated to this purpose, in many cases, have yielded limited results for various reasons concerning time and effectiveness of the instruments used. With this in mind, I welcome the review and analysis of the Union’s policy on related matters, as presented in the EU’s annual report on human rights and democracy. One desirable outcome from the annual report would be the formation of a common EU strategy on human rights with clear definitions of the actions, timetables and responsibilities of each of the European institutions. Such a strategy will certainly point the way forward to setting and attaining ambitious goals, while holding the EU and recipient countries to greater accountability on the usage of funds and the results accomplished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we need today is much more coherence in conducting the CFSP. That means moving human rights issues to the centre of our foreign relations. The role of the EU Member States in implementing the EU human rights policies should be clearly and bindingly articulated because the new strategy will bite only if all the 27 governments back it by their practical and coordinated policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the news that human rights focal points have been established in 116 EU foreign delegations by now. However, this has to be guaranteed by obligatory human rights training for all levels of the EEAS staff, including heads of delegations. Also, performance reviews on human rights should become an integral part of annual evaluations of all EU diplomats. Finally I am satisfied that the aspect of freedom of religion has been included in the training provided to the relevant EU staff. This should be even more strongly reinforced and become one of the core issues in the human rights dialogues with third states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to ensure that this UN convention and the EP report on mobility and inclusion of people with disabilities and the European disability strategy 2010-2020 really achieve results in the world, it is necessary for this commitment to also appear in the EU’s international relations, in line also with item 106 of my report.

For example, in Latvia, the parliament, by recommendation of the government, decided to increase the retirement age of Latvians just because of lack of funds in the social budget while ignoring the fact that, if Latvians retire at the age of 65, then the majority of them will not live to retirement age because the average age is 68 years for men in Latvia. What is more, after 55, it is very difficult to find a decent and well-paid job. I think that step by the Latvian Government and parliament violates the fundamental rights and freedoms of Latvian people since they are subject to unequal conditions in comparison to pensioners in France, Germany and other EU countries, where the average life duration is 80 years old, and the retirement age is 65. It means that on average, throughout the EU, a pensioner receives a pension for 15 years, but in Latvia, from one to three years. To stop injustice it is necessary to take immediate measures on the reallocation of EU social funds in order to level the difference in pensions between old Member States and new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that in the future, we will be able to be timelier in addressing the human rights situation in the world. Nevertheless, the report outlines a great number of issues that ought to be discussed in the Council. For example, the case of Sergey Magnitsky has not been properly brought up in the Council as it should have been after the adoption of the previous annual report. Instead, the Russian authorities continue to persecute Sergey Magnitsky’s family and avoid bringing those responsible for his death to justice. I would call the High Representative to consider further action with regard to the case of Sergey Magnitsky, in particular, setting targeted sanctions against the Russian officials who are to blame in the demise of this brave man who uncovered rampant corruption within the administration of the Russian Federation. The annual report is far too important to allow it to become another impotent document; therefore, it must be backed up by concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU must, above all, ensure that it shows consistency in its human rights policy and must categorically insist that these rights are respected both within the EU and in its relations with third countries. For the sake of setting an example, it is important that the EU signs up to the European Convention on Human Rights as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which acquired legal force two years ago, is an instrument that should be used more frequently and more effectively. A report on its implementation out this week says that the Charter is referred to by the courts more frequently than was the case earlier, which is a good thing. At the same time, though, the report states that it is still unclear to citizens as to when it is to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to safeguard the fundamental rights of EU citizens, the directive on equal treatment must be adopted as soon as possible. The fact that there is no ban on discrimination outside the workplace means that it is precisely the most vulnerable groups, such as older people, who do not enjoy the protection of the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At each plenary session of Parliament, we discuss specific cases of breaches of human rights worldwide. Most human rights violations are associated with extreme poverty, and it is therefore essential that we develop a set of principles on the application of standards and criteria relating to human rights in the context of the fight against extreme poverty. Similarly to the rapporteur, I see the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World presented by the European External Action Service as being largely descriptive. Following the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty and the creation of the European External Action Service, more specific, longer term measures and objectives were needed for the promotion of, and respect for, human rights globally, to which the report could have referred. The EU supports many development programmes in which it should set specific, measurable and time-bound objectives for human rights and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A strong role for the European Parliament is required to ensure the effectiveness of EU policy in this regard and this should be brought about through the creation of a strong mechanism for implementing its decisions. Involvement of Member States is vital to take full advantage of the potential of this strategy. Above all, however, civil society must play a central role in its implementation. For this reason, I am delighted to see that the role of the Sakharov Prize is being strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Council and to the Commission to provide – as far as this is possible – protection to winners of the Sakharov Prize in situations where they are being persecuted. I would remind you that activists in the Memorial organisation, who won the prize in 2009, were arrested shortly after their return from Strasbourg. Members of the European Parliament should meet with defenders of human rights when they are visiting and should initiate and maintain a constructive dialogue with them. ‘Digital democracy’, when used in the right way, can also play an important role in supporting activists working for democracy and human rights, as we have seen in the Arab Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is considerably more restrained when large countries are involved. Secondly, despite the creation of a European External Action Service, problems continue in policy coordination across EU institutions. A key role in this regard should be played by Union representations in individual countries, including diplomats, who specialise in the defence of human rights and who keep in contact not only with representatives of the local authorities, but also with representatives of the opposition and activists fighting for the protection of fundamental human rights. Thirdly, the Union should support those academics, publicists and students who wish to devote themselves to the protection of human rights through its grant and research programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title15"></a><a name="creitem15"></a>

The takeover grew from a mutiny calling for better weapons and better leadership in order to fight the Tuareg rebellion advancing across the North. Following strong leadership by the West African regional organisation, ECOWAS, as well as continuous pressure from the international community – including the European Union and the United Nations – an agreement was reached on 6 April 2012 providing for a return to civilian rule with the appointment of the Speaker of the National Assembly as interim Head of State. He will then appoint a new prime minister and a government representing all parties. New elections need to take place as soon as the voters’ list can be updated.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Northern Mali deteriorated very quickly following the <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. The Tuareg rebel MNLA captured the three strategic towns of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu in quick succession after government troops withdrew. On 5 April 2012, the MNLA declared the independence of the Tuareg’s northern homeland, Azawad, a declaration which was immediately rejected by the African Union. We have also heard that the former Prime Minister of Mali was arrested for the third time yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Honourable Members know that the European Union has been concerned by the fragility of the Sahel for some time. It has been increasingly clear that development and security have to go hand in hand. With this in mind, we proposed the comprehensive approach of the Sahel strategy, which the Council adopted a year ago, and appointed a Senior Sahel Coordinator in this service. The strategy includes a financial top-up allocation of EUR 50 million to contribute to supporting Malian security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Libya and its fallout exacerbated an already existing problem, causing well-armed fighters to spill out into a region where terrorism, hostage taking, drug trafficking and criminality were already serious problems. Coming on top of the recurrent food insecurity, a major food crisis has greatly worsened conditions for a large part of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout, our aim has been to work with the governments of the region. Where the government is strong, that works well. But the military coup in Mali undermined both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the government as well as threatening the sovereignty of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemned the seizure of power by the military in Mali on 22 March 2012 and called for the re-establishment of legitimate government and the holding of elections as soon as possible. The Foreign Affairs Council of 23 March 2012 strongly supported the efforts of ECOWAS to restore constitutional and democratic government in Mali. Our development cooperation with Mali was immediately put on hold. This did not affect humanitarian aid, nor did it affect any projects working directly with and helping the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I have welcomed the agreement reached thanks to the mediation of Burkina Faso, acting on behalf of ECOWAS, and signed on 6 April 2012 by the military. I have also urged all parties – including the military – to respect its terms and to allow the swift restoration of full power to a legitimate government.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken with President Ouattara, who is acting as Chairman of ECOWAS, to reinforce this message. I also discussed the evolving situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon yesterday in Brussels. The inauguration of Dioncounda Traoré as interim President and the release of the detained ministers come as good news. However – as I have already indicated – the reports of the arrest of the former Prime Minister and of another senior politician are of deep concern. It will be on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday next week.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the interim government is up and running, we shall discuss how best the EU can support the transition, including the holding of elections. The Commission is now preparing to resume the suspended projects as soon as the political and administrative conditions are met, particularly as regards fulfilment of the agreement with ECOWAS to restore a legitimate government.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be for the interim government to decide what support – including military – they may want from external partners, and from whom. We are already in close touch with ECOWAS concerning their proposals to provide support for the security sector, notably for the North, but we also need to work closely with all neighbouring countries – Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire – all of which have a clear interest in the events taking place in Mali. Such an option requires careful reflection on what the nature of such a mission should be and how to coordinate it with the necessary reinforcement of Mali’s national army and gendarmerie.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 March 2012, the Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly expressed grave concern at the deterioration of the situation in the North. It is not in the interests of the people of Mali, the region or the European Union for this to become effectively a lawless zone. The Council has made clear its commitment to the territorial integrity of Mali. A way must therefore be found to restore governance and democracy to the North.</p>
<p class="contents">This is made all the more urgent by the increasingly serious humanitarian situation. Overall, there are now over 200 000 internally displaced persons within Mali, and more than 140 000 are estimated to have fled to neighbouring countries. For 2012, we have increased our humanitarian aid budget for the Sahel from EUR 45 million to EUR 105 million. Across Mauritania, Niger, Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso, the Commission is implementing over EUR 250 million in humanitarian aid and food security actions for an estimated population of 50 million people. An additional EUR 9 million was added earlier this month for food, shelter and water for Malian refugees and internally displaced persons. For now, our primary aim is to deliver quick relief to the most affected and vulnerable populations. The EU remains committed to the preservation of the unity and sovereignty of Mali. It will remain in close contact with the new interim authorities in Bamako to define the concrete assistance in all the different fields – food, electoral process security and so on – that it can provide.</p>
<p class="contents">Stability in the region is essential for all Europe’s African partners. That is why we intend to mobilise all our efforts to find solutions, not only for the urgency of the next weeks, but also for the medium and long term, with the clear intention of assisting Mali in regaining its sovereignty in the northern part of its territory and being again a true united nation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A similar role was played by ECOWAS in the case of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">Of more concern though – for Africa but also for the security and stability of Europe itself – are the developments in Northern Mali. Heavily-armed and battle-hardened Tuareg militias – which served as mercenaries in support of Gaddafi and constitute an Islamist fundamentalist movement supported by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb – have managed to take advantage of the situation and take over the towns of Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao, unilaterally seceding and declaring the independent state of Azawad.</p>

<p class="contents">We see before us a country in crisis, which, until recently, was held up as a model pupil, in particular, because of its capacity for democratic changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">Mali must now face up to three challenges: re-establishing democracy, re-establishing territorial unity and improving the living conditions of Malians, who are still dependent on external aid. How should these challenges be met? Of course, Mali bears the foremost responsibility. However, as the same threats affect neighbouring countries, the response must also be a regional one. This is the role of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), an organisation which works in close partnership with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Europeans, we have a clear interest in supporting the Economic Community of West African States to reflect on a post-Gaddafi strategy, given that the upheavals in Libya are at least partially to blame for the events that have taken place in the Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience and our expertise in terms of cooperation in the most diverse areas puts us in a position to share information with countries experiencing difficulties. Europe’s strategy for the Sahel, formulated one year ago, integrates all these dimensions.</p>

All his children, of both sexes, had studied there. However, none of his children were still living or working in Mali because the situation was too dangerous, it was too uncertain, and the Tuareg felt too heavily discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">The man said ‘Those rebels, the Tuareg rebels, are villains, it is all very well for them to talk about Islam, but they have never seen the inside of a mosque!’ He is a reasonable man, but even he said: ‘I understand them and I support them, the rebels’. And I think that sends out a dangerous signal. When I left him, I had still not entirely understood what he was talking about. However, it is very clear to me that in Mali, we are not talking about a conflict that has just started. We are talking about a lack of cooperation that has lasted for generations and a lack of respect for minorities on the part of those who are in the majority.</p>
<p class="contents">However, here too – and the same thing happens all the time – we again have a case of unfair distribution of wealth. There is money in the Malian soil, raw materials which could enable the country to become rich.

The MNLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad) separatist rebels must now hand over control of the northern areas which they currently control to the central political authorities in Mali, as demanded by the international community. Anything else will destabilise the strategically vital Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">The MNLA leaders should also now be subject to EU asset freezing and travel bans until compliance is forthcoming. Particularly worrying is the advantage gained from Mali’s internal strife by extremist Islamist factions. The al-Qaeda and the Islamist Maghreb, for instance, are almost certainly responsible for a series of barbaric kidnappings and murders aimed at westerners in this fragile region. I therefore now call upon the Vice-President/High Representative to mobilise EU resources to aid the constructive efforts of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) in restoring Mali’s territorial integrity and to engage fully alongside the UN with the newly installed interim President Traoré to help build a democratic Mali based on the rule of law and with the aid of new, free and fair elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the fact that the situation is moving in the right direction, at least as far as the capital is concerned. However, the capital and the surrounding area are only a small part of Mali. This does not resolve the problem of the occupation and the unilateral declaration of independence. I very much welcome the fact that the EU has agreed to do what it is good at, which is providing humanitarian aid. The aid will definitely be arriving on the ground very soon. I think we should also make use of the time we have to ensure that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) can play its role. Of course, we must also agree this with the African Union. We have already provided aid in other cases where the African Union has taken action as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem in this context is the breakdown of the rule of law in the Western Sahara and across Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan and also southern Algeria and southern Libya. State institutions have a limited presence in these areas, with the result that a vacuum has developed which has allowed terrorist organisations to gain a hold.

I would just like to remind you of a feeling of unease in relation to this problem because, as we said before, we saw it coming. It really is the chronicle of a catastrophe foretold. We – I am referring to Mr Gahler, myself and Mr Goerens – who have seats in the ACP, have been listening for months now, since the Libyan intervention, to the panic-stricken cries of our Malian colleagues who said to us: ‘Something is going to happen in Mali’. We heard them at the ACP meeting in Togo, and the day prior to the coup, and in Brussels, whereby our colleague, Mr Assari, showed genuine anger and desperation when he said, ‘But you must help us!’ and the coup took place the very next day ...</p>
<p class="contents">So, we want to say, ‘How was it that we were not able to do anything?’ We had a strategy for the Sahel, we knew the facts, we knew that something was going to happen, and today we have heard people say, ‘We will support the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), we will try and foster regional cooperation, we will try, once there is a transitional government in place, to undertake development actions for some of these regions which are very poor’. However, might we not have been able to limit the damage as regards what is now happening, knowing full well that today, it is a real powder keg?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in looking towards the past and we must look forwards, but I believe that we must take into account all of these problems, as Ms Vergiat explained very well: it was a foreseeable problem and so we must therefore seize it with both hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) is therefore fighting for recognition of the Tuareg people’s historical and cultural rights. In my view, this is entirely legitimate. However, it is a question of helping the Malian military to suppress the Tuareg movement, particularly due to the threat of Islamist terrorism in the region. That seemed to be what you were saying in your speech, in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to this option as the MNLA has no connection to, or affinity with, the radical Islamist movement. On the contrary, the Amazigh traditions followed by the Tuareg people oppose Sharia law. They propose instead a customary law system that is much more tolerant, particularly with regard to women’s rights. The Tuareg people and the MNLA will do much more to protect against fundamentalism than any military regime propped up by Western powers.

<p class="contents">Only twenty years ago, Mali was finally established as a democratic multi-party state with a new constitution. Since last month, the constitution has been suspended, and only eleven days ago there followed the self-proclaimed secession of the northern part of Mali, which has very worrisome links with terrorists and what we might call the aftermath of Gaddafi.</p>
<p class="contents">We first need to address the humanitarian situation there, because it is currently estimated that one tenth of the fifteen million strong Mali population is in need of emergency food assistance. Secondly, we need to support this transitional agreement, which fortunately has been achieved thanks to the efforts of West African states. That is progress, because if the position is established that no military coups will be accepted, there is still hope that democracy can be re-established. However, the main thing is to get direct humanitarian aid to these areas to prevent this situation developing into a humanitarian disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resignation of the President who was removed may end the political crisis in this country which had managed, following the fall of the military dictatorship in 1991, to remain fairly loyal to democratic principles. However, the encouraging changes are, unfortunately, overshadowed by the danger from separatists in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that once a firm call has been made to the interim authorities to return to democracy and organise the elections that have been called for, we must condemn outright the aggression of the Tuaregs and extremist factions who have unilaterally declared independence for a region on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. We can no longer stand idly by in the face of the increasingly destructive onslaught being waged in Africa by factions under al-Qaeda’s control, because we do not want a Maghreb region controlled by extremists on our doorstep.

One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep.</p>

As they have said, it is absolutely right that the European Union should engage. We have a vital interest in the security, stability and development of the whole Sahel region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are firmly supportive of ECOWAS’ efforts and those of the neighbouring countries, and we are remaining in close contact with them regarding how we can help the political transition. I pay tribute to President Ouattara who himself, not that long ago, experienced enormous difficulties in Côte d’Ivoire and who is now very much putting his chairmanship on the line in terms of support for the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain very preoccupied with the situation in the North, and we reiterate our support for the territorial integrity of Mali. We are in contact with ECOWAS on a number of issues, including how to work with its ideas to establish a collective force to help the new, legitimate government to restore order throughout the national territory. We have most recently decided upon a civilian CSDP mission in the region and are considering what other support might be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am especially concerned that large numbers of people are being forced to flee the North in the middle of what is already a major food crisis. We are determined to offer our support to provide humanitarian aid everywhere we can, subject only to the physical safety of humanitarian workers.</p>

Regime forces have bombarded cities with no regard for civilians. Violence has not spared children. We all want, above everything, the violence and killings to stop, and everyone is extremely worried by the potential for further militarisation and escalation of the conflict. The increased violence that we saw leading up to the ceasefire deadline of 12 April was totally unacceptable, and reports about shelling in the city of Homs and civilians killed in Hama and Deraa are extremely disturbing. Violence has abated, but that is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I urge in the strongest possible terms that the cessation of violence be for real, and that Kofi Annan’s plan be implemented immediately and in its entirety. The honourable Members will know how fragile and unstable the situation remains. The violence in Homs, Hana and Aleppo are tragic reminders of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The House will have seen that the UN Security Council adopted unanimously – and I emphasise that unanimity – on Saturday a resolution approving the immediate deployment of an advance team of up to 30 military observers to Syria to begin reporting on the implementation of a full cessation of armed violence. They left for Syria on Sunday and are now on the ground starting their work. It is an important development for the implementation of the UN and League of Arab States Special Envoy Kofi Annan’s six-point plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with our EU representatives at the UN Security Council, to whom I pay tribute for their work and for their engagement, and all our Member States, we have spared no effort to try and ensure that the international community speaks with one voice. I and my services have engaged in particular with Russia and China – last week on the margins of the G8 meeting in Washington – to seek their support and a change in their position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Security Council resolution presents, finally, a unified call from the international community to the regime, and I quote: ‘the urgent, comprehensive and immediate implementation by the Syrian Government of all the elements of the Envoy’s six-point proposal in their entirety’.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a matter of choice. The six-point plan is not optional. The government has to implement it fully. Troops and heavy weapons have to be withdrawn from population centres, peaceful demonstrations and freedom of association must be respected, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting must be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">Only through a credible and sustained halt to violence will Kofi Annan be able to develop a peaceful, inclusive and Syrian-led democratic transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrians. We are watching very closely the situation on the ground. We have called on all parties to comply with his plan. Given the government’s responsibility and record of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments, this resolution is an opportunity for the regime to change course and cooperate fully.</p>
<p class="contents">Unanimous action is what we have been calling for from the beginning of this crisis, and now it is of utmost importance that the members of the Security Council continue to support Kofi Annan in his efforts and ensure that a fully-fledged observation mission in Syria is operationalised without delay. China and Russia must continue to play a key role in bringing a solution to the conflict, using all their influence to ensure the Security Council resolution is fully implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, on a number of occasions, personally expressed my support to Special Envoy Annan and told him and the Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, with whom I met yesterday, that the EU and the Member States stand ready to provide any required support to the observation mission. In our cooperation with the League of Arab States, we have already helped build the League of Arab States Situation Room to improve communications, and we are training them to develop their analysis and ability to respond to crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I convened the Crisis Platform again to bring together all the services of the EEAS and the Commission, under the chairmanship of Secretary-General Pierre Vimont. We are putting all our instruments together, coordinating closely with Kristalina Georgieva and her work and humanitarian aid and support, and reaching out to all the countries neighbouring Syria, both through ambassadors in Brussels and through the authorities on the ground. We are working closely with all the Member States to try and ensure an effective and coordinated EU response.</p>
<p class="contents">We have suspended all types of cooperation, including bilateral cooperation, and Syria’s participation in regional programmes. The European Investment Bank, with which we work closely, has suspended all its loan operations and technical assistance to Syria. We have nevertheless maintained aid that benefits the Syrian population, students, human rights defenders and the opposition. Those programmes with Syrian students and universities will continue. We are supporting efforts to deliver shelter, medical supplies, food and whatever is needed. We have put together a contribution of EUR 29 million in humanitarian aid to Syria and the neighbouring countries affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Support to the neighbouring countries is also essential. I discussed these issues when I was in Turkey over the weekend with Foreign Minister Davutoglu, who also joined the G8 Foreign Ministers by video link. The humanitarian and security situation on the Turkish border is critical, and the Turkish response has been excellent, with fast and professional support to the 25 000 refugees in its territory. I have offered our assistance on a number of occasions to Foreign Minister Davutoglu and did so again this weekend. I remain in close contact with him and his services for whatever is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working closely with Jordan and Lebanon and are ready to mobilise our instruments to respond to their requests. I have started to discuss the details of that support with the Foreign Minister of Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we continue to act as fast as we can, liaising closely with local ministries. Many of the displaced populations in neighbouring countries live not in camps but with families. That is why we are looking into broader and wider support, including assistance to host families and support to the regions and populations most directly affected by the inflow of Syrian citizens, particularly in the fields of health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">To do this, together with Commissioner Füle, I have proposed as a matter of urgency a Commission Special Measure to reserve EUR 23 million for funds to support specifically Syrian civil society, as well as refugees and affected populations in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides our assistance, I want to make it clear that we are ready to continue to impose sanctions and restrictive measures for as long as the repression continues. The last round of sanctions was approved at the Foreign Affairs Council of 23 March, and we are working on a new set of sanctions and restrictive measures. Today, my team is in Paris taking a leading role in the meeting of the working group on sanctions created at the Istanbul meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that our delegation remains open in Damascus for as long as the security situation permits. We need to have eyes and ears on the ground and to be close to the Syrian population. The Syrian people have asked us not to leave. We are hosting diplomats from Member States that have decided to suspend the activities of their own embassies. Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands now have diplomats within the EU delegation in Damascus.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say a word about engagement with Syrian opposition groups, which is a critical issue in which I believe the European Parliament has an important role to play. I thank Parliament for its efforts in reaching out to opposition groups. Our main objective remains to encourage all groups to put aside their differences, work together towards stronger coordination and agree on a way forward for an orderly transition that is both inclusive and democratic. They need to build a common vision for the future of Syria, where all Syrians from all backgrounds and affiliations are free and equal. I have instructed the External Action Service to continue its meetings with opposition groups and to reach out to minority groups to encourage them in this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The future of Syria belongs to the Syrian people. Their lives, their rights and their aspirations must be respected. We need to do as much as we possibly can, but it is now time for President Assad to match his words with deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill.</p>
<p class="contents">The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What came out of all of this? I am not sure that things are any clearer than at the start. In any case, all of the Syrians with whom we spoke were very afraid of what I will call a ‘proxy war’; in other words, a war fought vicariously between Sunnis, Shia, etc., with geopolitical interests being played out in Syria and with possible interventions by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc. These people told us: ‘our revolution will be stolen from us’.</p>
<p class="contents">It really seems as though the Annan plan is the only way out in Syria, besides civil war. It is not very satisfactory, but that is the feeling being expressed there. The solution is the Annan plan, but an improved Annan plan, a viable Annan plan, an Annan plan that would provide for Assad’s exit from power in the short term. It is here, then, that more work needs to be done, and we discussed the implementation of the Annan plan at length with members of the Syrian opposition. However, they live in terrible fear of civil war and of the influence of Qatar, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise a second point very quickly. Refugees are a priority. They are a priority that we seem to consider humanitarian, but they are a political priority. Within Lebanon, they are a political priority. These are members of the Syrian opposition and they are up against Hezbollah. It is therefore crucial that we make them our political priority – I am concluding – and I would like to say to you, Baroness Ashton, that you are right to have kept a European Union embassy in Damascus; do as we did in Benghazi and put the European flag …</p>

I do not think that we still have an Annan plan or that the plan is working.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us face the facts. She did not talk about these. More than 100 breaches of the Annan plan have been identified in the last two days. More than 50 people were killed yesterday. I do not know how many casualties there have been today in Syria. So how can you talk about an Annan plan – an Annan plan that is not being applied in practice by Bashar al-Assad? Does the international community need several hundred more killings before everybody recognises that in fact, it is not working because Bashar al-Assad is not willing to apply it? I think all this is leading to an increased number of killings and deaths in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest idea is for us to put observers there, and the international community and the European Union are saying that we shall give every support. What does this support mean? To put in place 215 observers, you need to spend several thousand euro on military equipment to protect them. Otherwise, it is impossible. Mr Vimont is a specialist, maybe he can tell us. In a normal operation in Syria, with 215 observers on the ground, how many soldiers would you need? Why should we do it? To protect our observers, not to protect the Syrian people who are still under attack by Bashar al-Assad. I really do not think this is the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to observe – what in fact we know already – is that the plan is not working. Bashar al-Assad is killing more people. We know that Bashar al-Assad is ignoring his promises and is simply continuing with crimes against humanity. Is that what we need to know? We already know it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think there is any time left now. What we need to do now is not to observe and to protect the observers but to act. We know what this means. It means three things: safe zones, humanitarian corridors and support for the Syrian opposition. If we can do this with the Security Council, let us do it with the Security Council. If it is not possible with the Security Council because of the position taken by Russia and China, we will do it without the Security Council. But the international community has an obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a last question. Can you give us some information on the recent incident with a German ship that is trying to deliver arms to Syria and that is directly breaching the arms embargo?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President – and I think I also speak for Ms De Keyser – problems as serious as the crisis in Syria are more important than you always putting your hammer down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the most important thing is to keep up the pressure, to offer observers helicopters and airplanes, and – as Ms De Keyser said – to support operationalisation, because so far, we have not seen the results that are really needed. We need to support the opposition both politically and logistically, and we cannot just leave it to others to support them selectively. I think that there is a risk that we will not see a building up of common ground, but I think that this could be our role.</p>
<p class="contents">On the humanitarian side, we need to make it clear that the rights of refugees need to be guaranteed. Shooting at refugees from any side is unacceptable. Having said that, it is also our duty to help and support refugees in the countries in which they arrive. We can and must do much more there.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me point out one really important issue: we need to act ourselves in order to end the bloodshed in Syria. We need to be serious about our own arms embargo, and there are two incidents that I want to mention. On 10 January 2012, the Cypriot authorities allowed a Russian ship carrying more than 59 tonnes of weapons destined for Assad to dock and refuel, despite clear evidence of its dangerous cargo. This is outrageous. Cyprus cannot buy a financial bail-out from Russia at the expense of the Syrian opposition. On 13 April 2012, a German ship sailing under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda was stopped on its way to Syria. The ship has now apparently changed its course, but – as of today – its exact whereabouts are unknown. This is unacceptable. The UN and its Member States have a duty to ensure that the arms embargo is respected. I have already sent you a priority written question on this, asking you to investigate the role of Cyprus in the aforementioned incident. So far, I have not heard back from you. As a matter of urgency, we therefore ask you in an open letter to investigate these incidents and also finally to develop a real monitoring and oversight mechanism of our embargo systems. I will now personally deliver this letter to you, and I look forward to your answer.</p>

However, I think that it is right, at the same time, for us to bear two things in mind and to put them in the balance. How many thousand dead must be put on one side of the scale before we accept that it balances a questionable democracy in the future; I do not think that there are many people here in this Chamber who believe that fifty thousand or more fatalities in Iraq balance the fact that Iraq now has what I referred to earlier: a questionable democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to support the view that no arms should be exported to Syria, regardless of by what method or what route, and we also need to support the Annan plan without accepting any infringements in respect of Syria. That is the only way we shall understand the clout that Syria has in the area. I do not agree with the stand that Syria or China should be disregarded. Whether we like it or not, members of the UN Security Council are acting out of geostrategic interests and what we should be interested in is the outcome. In other words, no more people should die in Syria. Precluding the facility for Syria to import arms, together with our insistence that the Annan plan be applied in full to Syria, is – I think – the only way to contain the situation and the bloodshed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is being played out in New York, with the West opposing Russia and China; the other is being played out on the ground between the Sunnis – backed by the Saudis and the Qataris – and the Shi’ites, who are supported by Iran, which backs the Assad regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the hypocrisy very disturbing indeed, and this also applies to our own Member States. There are those who are talking about a humanitarian corridor, but who are doing nothing to make it a reality. Such a step would require military security in the area of the humanitarian corridor, namely in Turkey. They are, of course, playing a game of political hypocrisy, and the aforementioned unacceptable breach of embargoes needs to be clarified by our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is crucial for the EU to support the Annan plan because it is the only game in town capable of preventing a prolonged civil war. At the same time, it should be very clear that we want Assad out of power and brought before the ICC. This is not in the Annan plan, but it should be made clear in the EU’s dealings. He and the others in his regime should be tried for the crimes they have committed against the people of Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that we support the Annan plan in any way we can, namely, in terms of providing security for the observers to perform – if they are indeed to perform. We also need to give support to the refugees – not only those in Turkey, but also those in countries like Lebanon, who are facing very difficult conditions, as well as the populations who are housing them. Finally, we need to engage with the Syrian opposition to make sure they unite on a democratic platform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been stated in this Chamber, more than 11 000 people have died, while tens of thousands of others have been injured, illegally arrested or forced to go into exile. Unfortunately, the external pressure and sanctions that have been applied have failed to deliver the desired results. Indeed, the breaches of the fragile ceasefire, which came into force last Thursday, highlight the fact that the Assad regime is not sincere in its undertakings to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, all the regime in Damascus has done until now is to make token gestures backed up by increasing repression. Although a consensus has not been reached on the Syrian crisis in the UN Security Council, there is a Council declaration from 21 March which supports the settlement plan of joint UN and Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan.

<p class="contents">The use of heavy weapons by the Syrian army against government opponents has already claimed thousands of victims, especially from the civilian population. After repeated efforts by the UN Security Council to halt military operations, the Special Envoy, Kofi Annan, has managed to persuade the warring parties, the Syrian Government and opposition fighters, to accept a six-point peace plan enabling them to move towards a bloodless resolution to the conflict under UN auspices. The fragile truce that has been brought about recently is enabling members of the observer mission, who will monitor the observance of the ceasefire by the conflicting parties, to be deployed in critical parts of the country. However, I think that the halt in military operations must immediately be used to launch a real dialogue on the country’s political issues under the auspices of the United Nations.

By granting Turkey the status of an accession candidate, we are bringing the problems of the Middle East right into our own front room and into the heart of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Syria, for many years there has been government opposition demanding it and wanting changes in the Syrian political system. However, what we are seeing today is not a revolution, nor the military crushing of a peaceful popular uprising. What we are seeing today in Syria is a military conflict instigated, financed, armed and encouraged from the outside. What we are dealing with here is the arming, financing and training of mercenary forces and terrorists by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and, according to different sources, the United States and France as well. What we are seeing is not just an internal Syrian conflict but a destabilising operation by imperialists and their allies who want to secure control of resources and countries in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary peaceful solution to the conflict, which we advocate should be achieved through national dialogue within the UN, will only succeed if the European Union, the United States and other countries do not disrespect the sovereignty of the Syrian people and do not make demands, particularly financial and military ones, in the ongoing conflict. Until that happens, alleged peaceful intentions and concerns are pure and simple hypocrisy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This definitely makes the implementation of the six-point plan a difficult undertaking. We will undoubtedly find out over the next few days whether the UN monitors can really do their job and whether they will be able to bring the government and the opposition together around one table or whether the ploys and delaying tactics that are being employed will cause them to fail, just as the Arab League observer mission did. If the UN monitors do not succeed, it is important for us to continue increasing the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should, in my opinion, think carefully before making any direct interventions of the kind that the opposition is calling for, such as a no-fly zone. In any event, the EU must put in place more effective plans for a post-Assad Syria.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, the passion and frustration that Members of this House feel is very obvious from all their contributions, and it is mirrored in every conversation I have with anyone who takes an interest in the plight of the Syrian people and the horror of what is happening to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make three particular points in closing this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that it is very attractive, emotionally and intuitively, to think about safe havens, corridors and so on, but we have to recognise that the violence in Syria is taking place across 180 000 km<span class="sup">2</span>. It is not in isolated places; it is everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to recognise that the humanitarian organisations are very nervous about anything which would involve the military coming in in support of their work, and we have to respect and listen to the experience that they have. In addition to that, remember that putting boots on the ground is a huge thing, and to do so without the UN Security Council is extraordinarily challenging to say the least. So it is very important that we recognise, when we talk about these ideas, what it is we are actually describing. It does not mean I am asking the honourable Members to reject them, I am simply saying we need to understand what it is we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the United Nations does not have an arms embargo because they could not get agreement in the Security Council. We have an arms embargo, the United States has an arms embargo and we are asking for details. I am working with the governments of Cyprus and Germany, who are looking into this right now, and I will respond with any information that I might have.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are doing everything possible and working as closely as possible with everybody else to try and get the opposition groups to unite. In my last conversation with Kofi Annan, this was very much on his mind: how to bring them together through either an umbrella or collaboration around the table, in order that they could put aside their differences and come to a common view. I know that in Istanbul, this was one of the big issues. So we are continuing to engage with them and with our colleagues across the world to try and support that unity of opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is my view that at the moment, the Kofi Annan six-point plan is where we have to concentrate our energy. It is where we finally have a Security Council resolution we can all get behind and with which we can hold everybody to account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there are already significant problems in Syria with the plan and with the ceasefire. It is also clear that the observers are ready to start their work. We have to back them and to work as hard as we can to get all the six points implemented and to do what Kofi Annan has asked us for, which is to offer him our full support. He has mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am shocked by the extreme violence that we are seeing there, but also particularly disturbed by the turn that events have taken. We should welcome the fact that the United Nations is finally addressing the issue. Kofi Annan’s plan seems to me a reasonable road map, offering hope of an end to the crisis. However, it appears that Bashar al-Assad is only using it to buy time. The ceasefire to which he had committed lasted only a few hours before he started shelling several cities again. Yet we must acknowledge the important resolution voted for unanimously by the United Nations Security Council, which enabled military observers to be sent into Syria. Their task is proving difficult while there is a lack of initial political will in place to bring an end to the crisis. However, it is now the only hope for the gradual implementation of Kofi Annan’s plan. I would take this opportunity to welcome the European diplomatic action that has managed to persuade Russia and China not to use their veto again in the UN. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title17"></a><a name="creitem17"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, after decades of internal repression, we see dramatic and hopeful changes taking place in Burma. Here is a democratic transition unfolding in what looks like a peaceful, collaborative fashion, acclaimed by the domestic electorate and the international community. This is a rare case indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing points to a government which is serious about change and wants to end its country’s isolation. President U Thein Sein shows courage and leadership. It would be a surprise, though, if he did not face resistance from some who have profited from the old system. Most importantly, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the President have established a relationship of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can measure the recent achievements against the three main items we have looked at in our policy review. First: national reconciliation; specifically, a willingness to recognise the special position of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and to see the National League for Democracy take its place in the political life of the nation. Here, our expectations have been more than met by the growing relationship between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the government, and by the change in the electoral law that enabled the NLD to register as a party and take part in the recent by-election.</p>
<p class="contents">This made it all the more important that the by-elections on 1 April 2012 should be well conducted. It was remarkable and welcome that the government invited the European Union to send experts to witness the poll. I was delighted that we were able to associate the European Parliament with this historic event and that Mr Ivo Belet could join the EU team at the elections. We did not observe the campaign, but it seems to have presented a mixed picture. In the poll itself, there was no sign of fraud and there is no reason to doubt the results. The NLD won 42 out of the 43 seats they contested. Compared to the 2010 elections, which were marred by massive fraud, this represents huge progress.</p>
<p class="contents">These bare facts hardly do justice to the importance of the occasion and the meaning it had for a people who had waited fifty years for democracy and endured so many disappointments with so much patience.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the release of political prisoners. A large majority have already been released, among them, prominent figures from the so-called ‘88 Generation’ and the National League for Democracy. It is difficult to be sure exactly how many remain, as there is a grey zone of uncertainty, but the number is significant, and we shall continue to work for their release. Again, there is real progress and a commitment to resolving the remaining cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: we wanted to see a real effort to achieve peace in the ethnic areas. All peace talks – with one exception – have brought ceasefire agreements. These are important steps, and we do not doubt the President’s commitment. The longest civil war in the world – the conflict with the Karen – may soon be over, even if the Kachin conflict remains a cause of great concern.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also progress on less visible fronts: legislation for trade unions, easing of media censorship – including unrestricted access to the Internet – and progress on the economic front, including liberalisation of the currency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is so much to do that the process of reform will inevitably take time. There are problems with human rights, with macro-economic management, and with health, education and energy. It is difficult to know where to start, but I believe that President U Thein Sein has made the right choice in beginning with the political problems. Securing ethnic peace is perhaps the most important and the most immediate challenge. But here, too, an effort that brings together all political forces can make a real difference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have followed these historic changes with respect and appreciation. In January, we suspended the visa bans on the government. At the end of this month, we shall do more. Decisions will be taken in the Foreign Affairs Council in a few days.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to go further and build a partnership. I will travel to Burma next week. I have invited the Foreign Minister to Brussels. I know that the European Parliament made a successful visit in February. I hope that what we are now seeing is an opportunity for this country to move forward. We need to enter into active collaboration to assist the reform process and to contribute to economic, political and social development. We have secured more funding – EUR 150 million. In addition to ongoing programmes in health, education and agriculture, I have launched a programme to help the national human rights commission. We will strengthen capacity in the public administration at central and regional level. I also plan to offer cooperation with the election commission to build on the success of the by-elections, for which it deserves much credit.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I want to work to secure peace and stability for ethnic regions and to open a long-term perspective for their development. I hope that the honourable Members will support me in working with the authorities to turn ceasefires into durable peace. In all these areas, we will work with the opposition as well as the government. Indeed, we very much hope they will be working together.</p>
<p class="contents">Removing sanctions and increasing aid is not enough: we all recognise, too, the vital contribution that the private sector can make. We want to encourage European companies to look for opportunities in Burma and to bring the highest standards of corporate social responsibility with them. In a longer perspective, the European Union hopes to reinstate the Generalised System of Preferences following the International Labour Organisation’s assessment. I believe I speak for all of us when I say that we look forward to collaborating constructively with the government, the opposition and indeed the people to reinforce their unity and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me express the hope that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will soon be able to come to this House to receive the Sakharov Prize she was awarded 21 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the first day of the Burmese New Year. I wish all the people a very happy New Year. Thanks to the determination of President U Thein Sein and the fortitude of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, there is a chance that for once, this wish might come true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, of course, also aware of the fact that everything is still very fragile in Burma. Is the reform process irreversible? Nobody knows. But we do know that the transparency and the openness of the by-elections of 1 April are not isolated factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Lady Ashton, you referred to the majority of the political prisoners that have been liberated. The presence of the international media and the international observers is a big step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Important steps still have to be made by the Burmese authorities. We clearly insist in our motion for a resolution, which will be put to the vote on Friday, that they must liberate all the political prisoners and that the real test of democracy will take place over three years, within which the general elections will be held.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact is that today, we are faced with a unique window of opportunity, and we have to grab it. It is crucial that the authors of the reform process in Burma/Myanmar receive a clear, strong signal of support from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, High Representative, we ask you (and this is important) – indeed, we ask the Council – to start reviewing the restrictive measures substantially in order to support the reforms. A strict evaluation of the impact of such a review within a year could be part of that decision. I think that the European Union and you, High Representative, hold the key in this process. You referred to the renewed potential of the relationship between the EU and Burma/Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and will benefit from an open economic partnership. It will be a win-win situation for both sides and, of course, we also rely on you to push for balanced development with full respect for the local population and the ecological richness of this country. We count on you, Lady Ashton, to take the lead in this process on a global scale and to start a new era for Burma/Myanmar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me, it was like a small miracle when President Thein Sein, a former member of the military junta, gave us a relatively credible explanation of his desire for reform. The critical test came at the beginning of this month, when the by-elections took place. It was very impressive to see how the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously had to operate in secret, achieved an overwhelming victory, despite the fact that obstacles were occasionally placed in the way of her election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one thing must be clear to us. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is still a very small party. It currently has only just over 40 seats. Therefore, the way in which it develops over the next few weeks, months and years will be decisive. The crucial landmark will be the 2015 elections. This is when it will become clear whether the citizens of Burma really have the opportunity to elect their members of parliament and their government freely, fairly and without outside influence. Until then, the reform process must continue at a rapid pace. It is essential that those who are currently in power make genuine progress and go on with the work that they have started. They must release the remaining political prisoners, as Mr Belet has already said. They must come to a ceasefire in the feuds that they are having with different ethnic groups and ultimately bring about peace. They must offer their citizens full democratic rights, such as freedom of expression in speech and writing, including on the Internet, in schools and in universities. They must ensure that there is a free and independent press and an independent judicial system. They must begin the systematic process of establishing the structures of a social market economy. We, together with our private sector, can and must help them to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">As Burma introduces more democracy and freedom for its people, so the West can reduce its sanctions or even lift them altogether. It is in all our interests for Burma to free itself from China’s embrace and to overcome the mass poverty among its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to speak today about the challenges with regard to human rights policy. I think it is a very good thing that the EU is supporting the UN in Bangkok and helping the national human rights commission in Burma to become truly independent and to fine-tune the methods it uses. These are positive developments, but they are not enough. The follow-up to the ceasefire agreements in particular is a difficult issue, because these agreements must lead to peace processes with 16 different groups covering a huge area. I believe it is very important for the EU to take action in this area and to ensure that the people who live there and the internal exiles and refugees who return there have the right to education, jobs, homes and health care. These are regions which are highly underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question that I have is whether the members of the military who are not among the reformers, but who are very influential, and who, under the terms of the constitution, are the holders of political power, will simply give up this power after the elections in 2015. I found out when I was there that these people also have economic power and considerable resources, such as wood and precious stones, are under their control. Therefore, I would ask you when you are considering which sanctions should be lifted to investigate carefully and not simply to lift those sanctions which will benefit the non-reformers among the military. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course we can have nothing but the greatest admiration for the tenacity and courage of Aung San Suu Kyi over all these years. She is an enormous example to all of us, and there are many Members of this Parliament who have campaigned for decades – in fact, for longer than most of us have been here (perhaps not the sitting Vice-President this evening, but certainly the rest of us). This Parliament has campaigned for a very long time to bring about the sort of results that we are seeing.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say a quick word, though, on the subject of sanctions, because some people are asking whether or not sanctions are ever useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Often, of course, they are the only recourse we have, short of armed conflict. In this case, I am sure they have helped. David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, was in Burma last week. He has spoken to Aung San Suu Kyi. He has spoken to President Thein Sein, and clearly they have all given certain messages to him which make him very confident that we should now suspend sanctions, with the exception of the arms embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must be wary, because democracy has not suddenly happened overnight in Burma. There is a long way to go. There are still hundreds of political prisoners who are incarcerated and must be released, and I would be interested in your view, Baroness Ashton, as to whether Thein Sein faces any opposition in his own ranks and how strong his position is.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have to take care, but I think we must also be seen to respond very positively to these developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks?</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, many political prisoners have not been released and, although the opposition leader has entered parliament, this does not change the fact that the regime has committed serious violations of human rights. Her brilliant election victory and the frenetic enthusiasm of her followers are likely to give rise to resentment among many of the supporters of the military regime. A lot will depend on whether the gradual, joint transition processes that have been agreed upon go according to plan, on what is being done to enable people to come to terms with the past, and on whether political change will bring with it a more open economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that Burma certainly still has a long way to go before it becomes a fully functioning democracy, the indications that we have seen so far are positive and should be acknowledged by the West and by the EU. We support a gradual lifting of sanctions which takes into consideration the progress made towards reform. However, in my opinion, that should not apply to the arms embargo. Only if the new policy of openness is followed by positive changes to the economy and if the living conditions of the people genuinely improve can we assume that the risk of a return to a military dictatorship has really been averted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We formed part of a delegation from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which visited Aung San Suu Kyi, the President and many members of the government. It was clear to us that it was the President who was responsible for initiating the reform process and not the sanctions. Therefore, we must support what he and what the leader of the opposition are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The release of prisoners is an important move and this must continue. The reform of the constitution must not come to an end with the by-elections. There is much to be done and we know that a reform process of this kind will not happen overnight. It takes time. Even in a much simpler situation, such as that of the German Democratic Republic, which was previously a Communist dictatorship and which was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany, the process lasted decades. Therefore, we must give it our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma is one of the richest countries in the world, but a small group of members of the military have exploited its wealth. Its population is currently one of the poorest in the world. This is partly because the sanctions, in particular, in the financial sector, have allowed the military leadership to put the billions earned from oil, gas and raw materials into the national budget at the old exchange rate of 1:6, while the actual rate with the US dollar is 1:800. In addition, less than 1% of the revenue has benefited the population and the rest has gone into the pockets of the military. This is where we must start. If we support this process and help to combat poverty, fill the gaps in the education system and develop the country’s infrastructure, and if we lift the sanctions gradually or for a specific period, we will be able to actively encourage Burma’s progress along the road to a genuine democracy. I hope that we and the Burmese people are successful. The ASEAN delegation will provide critical but positive support for this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has to encourage this reform process and review some of the sanctions, although certainly not the embargo on arms and those sectors crucial to military power, particularly mines and timber, and provided that the Burmese regime continues to facilitate democratic and pluralistic openness. For this, it is essential that political prisoners are released unconditionally and the laws that enabled their arrest are repealed; that military attacks on ethnic minorities stop and there is an end to impunity for those responsible for war crimes and other human rights abuses. The European Union must liaise with civil society and, given the prospect of elections in 2015, must be present to assist in training administrative staff and preparing the necessary reforms for other sanctions to be lifted. These clearly must include the independence of the judiciary, the fight against corruption, freedom of the press and expression and unrestricted Internet access, protection of minorities, labour rights, environmental laws defending the interests of the Burmese people and, of course, support for economic and trade development without ever ignoring the central issue of defending human rights. Above all, we must not forget that the true test of democracy in Burma will come with the necessary constitutional amendment removing the power of veto from the military who now occupy 25% of the seats in the Burmese Parliament, thereby preventing them from controlling the government that emerges from the 2015 elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is, of course, still room for democratic improvements. Allegations of intimidation and bribery at the ballot box in the recent elections should be fully investigated and, as Ana Gomes said, the Burmese military should publicly fully renounce their role in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, who, whilst in Rangoon, recommended that the more restrictive of the current EU sanctions should be lifted. Burma has tremendous potential and should be afforded the assistance of EU investment and political support to achieve all that it is capable of.

President Thein Sein has introduced a good reform agenda which has led to democratic and economic progress. Even the local council elections have been positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think – as many of my fellow Members have already said – that these positive developments should be rewarded. Consequently, I believe that we in the European Union should take the lead. So, I support Baroness Ashton’s initiative to visit Burma next week and to open an office there. During talks with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs next week, we really need to discuss the easing of sanctions. However, I think it is still too early to abolish all sanctions. After all, there are still too many significant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that Baroness Ashton should ensure that the arms embargo remains in place and that the visa restrictions for the junta are maintained. With this President and the democratic elections, Burma has definitely made a step in the right direction. However, this must be followed by economic and political support for the reforms, by the release of all political prisoners, by free and fair elections, and by an end to violence and human rights abuses in the areas where minorities still live at the moment. Only when all of that is accomplished will we be able, once the sanctions have been eased, to abolish them totally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no longer possible to say that the regime is still a junta. There are moves under way towards democracy that we have experienced at first hand and seen the effects of. I believe that everyone who has been involved in the introduction of democracy on the ground in Myanmar has been impressed, relieved and filled with enthusiasm. In my opinion, this is particularly true in the light of the debate that we have just held and the developments in Syria, Mali and Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the EU do to ensure that this process continues in Myanmar? Sympathy alone is not enough. We need to share responsibility for further development aid projects and give them our support. We should encourage the ASEAN countries and, in particular, Myanmar’s neighbour, Thailand, to continue helping, as they have already done for a long period. However, we also need to lift the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The following comment recently appeared in a newspaper: Myanmar is a gold mine with huge quantities of raw materials, gas and oil, and all of this is now available. The estimate is that growth will reach a level of 6%. We must also help to ensure – not alone, but the EU is partly responsible for this – that the growth and the wealth in what is still, in part, a very poor country does not end up in the capitals of America, Europe and China, but reaches the population. Only then will there be stable, peaceful and democratic long-term development in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I was also struck by her very cautious attitude to the way ahead. She was absolutely clear that any rush to completely remove sanctions would be premature and reminded us what happened after the last ‘free and fair’ elections in her country – that is, within months, the entire cohort of successful candidates were in prison as the military junta cracked down. She has welcomed proposals to suspend rather than lift sanctions and I believe that this is now the appropriate way forward. Suspension will allow reform to continue and be rewarded but serve as a reminder that the world is still watching.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would also like to stress that it is vitally important for the well-being of the people of Burma that we move quickly towards opening up the economy and encouraging strong and fair governance, both politically and financially.

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to pay homage to Aung San Suu Kyi because her victory shows the role of devotion to values and leadership in the transition to democracy.

<p class="contents">I am very glad, Baroness Ashton, to hear that you are thinking about initiating many cooperative programmes with Myanmar because this country has been totally closed for so many years. At the same time, I think we should press the Burmese Government to ensure that a new democratic constitution and independent judiciary are introduced.

<p class="contents">Their victory is a positive signal that showed the support of the population for pro-democracy forces and gave hope for further reforms. But the fact remains that the military junta still has a dominant influence in Burma, and unless significant changes take place after the elections in 2015, the opposition will remain limited by a constitution that guarantees the dominance of the army. Many political prisoners remain in detention. The status of ethnic groups in the country is unsustainable. It will therefore be necessary to monitor whether, and how, further reforms will follow. There is also the question of EU sanctions. I think that the people of Burma deserve our support. The reforms that the country urgently needs will not be possible with a dysfunctional economy. With regard to the situation, however, sanctions should be lifted only gradually. First, those that affect the poorest sections of the population. It is also necessary for the EU to maintain pressure on the military junta and support the trend towards reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Aung San Suu Kyi has achieved more than a symbolic victory. Nevertheless, she can expect a long and difficult journey in the continuing struggle for democracy in Burma. We should support her in this struggle, and not just symbolically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 23 April, Aung San Suu Kyi will take her place in parliament where her party will be the main opposition force. We do not yet know whether real change will come about in this country because the political scene is still dominated by the military, and the economic situation, clashes with groups of insurgents and the way in which minorities are treated still provide grounds for concern. However, the recent developments are positive, and the Burmese authorities need to be encouraged to continue the reforms. Against this background, I support the gradual lifting of EU sanctions. I think that this action will not only have a positive impact on the development of democracy, but will also boost foreign investment, thereby helping the country’s economic recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the celebrations, we must not forget that the military is still in power. The by-elections only involved 7% of all the mandates. The current constitution ensures that the military retains its supremacy. The President must come from within the armed forces and the ministries of the interior, defence and border control are reserved for members of the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2010, Burma has been creating a civilian image for itself. However, it still has a long way to go before achieving true democracy. For this reason, we must be very careful in our trade relationships with Burma. The arms embargoes and travel bans for those who have committed violations of human rights must remain in place. Nevertheless, an important process is starting in Burma. Mr Cameron has already been there, but Baroness Ashton has not yet visited.

To achieve peace, it is not sufficient to put an end to ethnic unrest. More is required. Aung San Suu Kyi also believes that Burma’s peace and future depend on agreement with the national ethnic minorities. In her view, federalism, self-determination and regional autonomy are a satisfactory solution for the minorities, too. If we wish to take seriously the situation and fate of the world’s minorities, then we can only do so in a credible way. That means setting an example and taking seriously the fate of the minorities living in the European Union and the discrimination they face, as we mentioned earlier this afternoon in the report by Mr Howitt. Indigenous national minorities have their own individual needs too, and must be given real equality extending to all aspects of life, and I should add that this must be ensured within the EU as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Van Orden, I agreed with every word that you said as well, alarming though that may be for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belet, can I thank you very much for the work that you did in the elections. I know from Robert Cooper what an important contribution you have made, and I must thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the honourable Members that what we are seeing is not irreversible, but every step that is taken makes it much more difficult for that reversal to take place. It is less likely and it is less easy for them to go backwards. I agree, too, that we have a lot to do. We want to make sure that the people have the right opportunities and can make their own choices after years of being cut off and apart from us.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go next week, because that was the agreement that I reached with – amongst others – Aung San Suu Kyi, who asked me to go after we had made the decisions about sanctions and in order to open the office. I respected her request in choosing the timing of my visit. I should say too that we have listened very carefully to her, as have leaders, ministers and parliamentarians who have visited her, the latest being the Prime Minister of the UK, Mr Cameron, who sent me a message about what she had said. My envoy, Robert Cooper, who has known her for many, many years, has visited four times in the last few months to ensure that we have been able to remain in good contact.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with everything that has been said about our need to move cautiously but properly, and to understand that the possible transformation that we are witnessing is absolutely and truly remarkable. What is interesting is that I have not met anybody who has been there who does not come back and talk with absolute admiration for what the President has done and the opportunities that are being opened up. For those who have followed this country’s actions over many years, there is also surprise that we find ourselves able to have this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the people of Burma/Myanmar very well. I pay due regard to the work that the President has done, I pay enormous tribute to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and I very much look forward to passing on to her and to the President your very good wishes when I see them next week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The party of Sakharov prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi – the National League for Democracy (NLD) – was able to participate in these elections. The international community judged these elections to be free and fair. At present, the opposition has just 6.6% of the seats in parliament (42 out of 659). It is my fervent hope that the reform process will continue. This is very important for the future of Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important for the Burmese democracy to be a civilian one. For this reason, we encourage the Burmese authorities to change the constitution and to discontinue parliamentary seats that are guaranteed to Army representatives. We count on dialogue developing and leading to profound changes. For this reason, we call on the Council to introduce a temporary suspension of the sanctions that are currently in place, with the exception of the arms embargo. Sanctions should be suspended for a period of one year. During this time, European Union institutions should carefully monitor the situation in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been following the situation in Burma closely now for years, and, from time to time, I have also been very critical. At the same time, I have supported EU sanctions aimed at improving the situation. Now, however, it is time to start rewarding Burma for its reforms. President U Thein Sein has done more for peace and democracy in Burma than anyone else in that country for decades. In Burma, they have now realised that an open, democratic society that respects human rights is the best alternative for everyone. The elections in April showed that Burma’s political leadership is prepared to make room for Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and other opposition groups, and that we are witnessing the start of a new era. The European Parliament has now made a clear concession to Burma, and it is now time for the EU to lift economic sanctions against the country. When we ask for reforms to be introduced and that is done, we also have to reward our partners. Nevertheless, the reforms should not end here. The EU must monitor the situation in Burma closely. The real acid test for Burma will be the elections in 2015, which I assume will represent a continuation of the policies that have now been inaugurated. Before that happens, we should not lift the ban on the sale of weapons. I would ask Baroness Ashton to take advantage of the rapprochement that has resulted from new diplomatic relations. We Members of Parliament should also strengthen our ties with Burma’s political leadership, the opposition and civil society. At the same time, I hope that Burma’s leaders will develop an ever more open attitude towards us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One such issue that is of great concern is the war that is taking place in the Kachin State. There are currently an estimated 70 000 refugees that have fled fighting near their homes to live in temporary camps by the Sino-Burmese border. Also, there were no elections in Kachin, due to the fighting, and it appears this conflict will not end any time soon. The ethnic Kachins are running out of food, and diseases such as TB and malaria are spreading fast, and yet the Burmese Government will not allow any aid agencies in to assist these people.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton our regional cooperation efforts and perspectives in the Black Sea area. I welcome the attention that the European Parliament is giving to Black Sea regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Black Sea region is a distinct geographical area rich in human and natural resources. It acts as a gateway between Europe, Asia and the Middle East and therefore offers Black Sea stakeholders an opportunity to identify areas where our interests come together to further practical cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2007, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the European Union has been directly involved in Black Sea affairs. There are significant opportunities and challenges in the region that require coordinated action. This is why we established the Black Sea Synergy in 2008 as the European Union’s contribution to regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sometimes asked whether the Black Sea Synergy duplicates the Eastern Partnership. My answer is no. The Eastern Partnership is about bringing our Eastern neighbours closer to the European Union through political association and economic integration. The Black Sea Synergy is about bringing the European Union closer to the Black Sea by contributing to regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a couple of personal comments here. There is, of course, interaction between the two – between the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy. We have developed the Eastern Partnership into a major instrument of our relationship with our eastern partners. I think it gives us an opportunity for the Black Sea Synergy to become a real instrument providing us with synergies between our policies in our region as we put together our efforts to build more of the European Union in our partner countries through our cross-border cooperation and our more active role in a regional framework of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">While our interests in the Black Sea are broad, ranging from the environment, maritime affairs and fisheries to energy, transport, movement and security, we have focused our activities on the creation of the three sectoral partnerships in the fields of the environment, transport and energy. In March 2010, we launched the Environment Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have a substantial programme of cross-border cooperation in the region which I referred to a second ago. The budget for the 2007-2013 Black Sea basin programme under the cross-border element of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument has increased from EUR 17 million to almost EUR 26 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The 18 projects implemented after the first call for proposals cover the three priorities of the European Union’s 2007-2013 Black Sea basin programme: supporting cross-border partnerships for economic and social development, sharing resources and competences for environmental protection and conservation, and supporting cultural and educational initiatives for the establishment of a common cultural environment in the basin. However, we have not progressed as much as we would have hoped in implementing the three partnerships. The time has thus come to reflect anew on how to take our cooperation in the Black Sea region forward. I therefore welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future Black Sea strategy, we have to make sure it will be well received both within the European Union and among the Black Sea States that are not part of our Union. In the meantime, we are reflecting on how to revitalise the Black Sea Synergy as a natural step towards the future strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In taking this forward, we will have three considerations uppermost in our minds. Firstly, we must reinvigorate the European Union’s approach to cooperation in the Black Sea region in a way which takes account of the variety of relations we have with the countries around the Black Sea. We have a candidate country (Turkey) and a strategic partner (Russia), plus our partners within the Eastern Partnership: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. We will also have to bear in mind the sometimes difficult relations these countries have with each other or with countries neighbouring the Black Sea region.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will need to take into account the other cooperation frameworks in the region. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. In the environmental field, the Black Sea Commission is an important player, and the European Union hopes to be accepted as a full member soon. We would also like to step up our engagement with the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation, especially in the context of its 20th anniversary summit due to take place in Istanbul on 26 June.</p>
<p class="contents">A reinvigorated Black Sea Synergy initiative and engagement with the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation will provide great opportunities to develop practical cooperation and to foster dialogue between the European Union and Russia and between the European Union and Turkey, both being important stakeholders in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last – and most important – point is this: we must play to the European Union’s strengths and the opportunities offered by the Lisbon Treaty to bring together our internal and external policies and instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to value the exchanges with Parliament on the Black Sea region as we take forward our process of reflection on how to enhance the European Union’s policy approach towards this important region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When the Black Sea Synergy was launched back in 2008, expectations were high. The launch of the Black Sea Synergy had several important merits: firstly, shaping the Black Sea region as a separate unit of EU policy making, and secondly, qualifying the region as strategically important for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Four years later, the results are disappointing. In terms of EU policy, the Black Sea region looks very much like a black hole. No global reporting on the implementation of the Synergy has taken place since 2008. No coherent policy document presents the current situation in the Black Sea region.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the challenges in the Black Sea are not waiting peacefully for the Commission to put pen to paper. The Black Sea is an unchecked collection of tensions and potential crises. Despite some improvements in sectoral fields – environment, maritime and fisheries policy – one cannot speak of improvements in strategic fields such as security and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">On two occasions – in 2008 and 2011 – the European Parliament called for the upgrading of the Black Sea Synergy to a Black Sea strategy, and the question still stands. Is the Commission planning to elaborate such a strategy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been mentioned, it includes EU Member States and candidate countries such as Turkey, our strategic partner Russia, and, of course, countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood. So it is in our interests to help bring security, stability and prosperity to the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are frozen conflicts in that region, some of which have been frozen for more than 20 years. What should be done in that region? I think the approach the Commissioner mentioned – supporting some of the sector policies such as transport, tourism, energy, the environment – is the right one. If we look at the work the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation are doing, these are exactly the areas which these organisations are looking at. We should support this. There are concepts such as building a Black Sea highway and linking ports in order to increase trust among the nations alongside the Black Sea and, of course, to increase tourism, energy security and environmental protection. Perhaps through this approach, step by step, we could also contribute to solving some of the frozen conflicts in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I think that the approach presented by the Commissioner is the right one and that we should support it. I think we should also be more active as far as our cooperation – the cooperation of the European Parliament – with the BSEC is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The policy of ‘more for more’ is important and is definitely the right approach. It will give our partners to the east the incentive to introduce more reforms and to make the necessary changes. Of course, this applies, in particular, to the countries around the Black Sea. The EU can offer help and act as a driving force for reform in a variety of areas. The region around the Black Sea will undoubtedly become more important over the next few years, not least because of the energy issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should take a circumspect, long-term approach to ensure that the interests of all the stakeholders can be taken into consideration as effectively as possible. This also applies to the question of constructing new oil and gas pipelines. The EU needs greater diversification in its energy supplies, but it should avoid becoming dependent on new partners, for example, Turkey. From a political perspective, we should welcome the fact that some Black Sea countries such as Ukraine are moving closer to the EU. However, in this case, we should, wherever possible, take legitimate Russian interests in this region into consideration, where they really are legitimate, in order not to put our partnership with Russia at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful for the honest evaluation of the current situation, which shows that we have nothing to congratulate one another about.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Black Sea region are becoming increasingly important because of their geographic proximity, the potential for dynamic growth in sales and in the labour market and their energy resources. The Danube, which is Europe’s main river, flows into the Black Sea. It is important for us to support cooperation between the countries of the Black Sea region and not to play one state off against another. It is also important for us to coordinate the activities of the Member States in this region and to ensure that individual Member States are not going it alone.</p>
<p class="contents">This region will determine the future energy security of Europe. The key words include diversification, interconnectivity and security of supply. The Nabucco gas pipeline is the main diversification project, along with other alternative and competing projects, such as South Stream. The region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, where Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia meet, is also characterised by active and frozen conflicts. Therefore, the important issues include not only the economy and energy, but also security and stability. I welcome the initiative to move closer in strategic terms to this region by taking a focused and professional approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore think it is important to strengthen their capacities and to reconstruct the associated transport infrastructure along the coast and inland in a coordinated way. This also applies to the River Danube, which is the most important shipping route from the Black Sea to the interior of Europe. I therefore consider it very important, from the economic perspective, to achieve a certain interconnection between the European conceptual documents, the strategy for the Black Sea region, and the Danube strategy. The nature of the development of the Danube region is well reflected in the development of the Danube Delta and the western Black Sea coast as a whole. The synergy of the objectives defined in these two European strategy documents can lead to the more efficient use of resources for the development of the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am a firm believer that together, the Black Sea Synergy – including our extensive range of cross-border cooperation – the European Union’s integrated maritime strategy and the European Union’s Danube strategy can build a coherent approach towards the Black Sea. Continuing along the same line as the last speaker, I could add that my colleague, Maria Damanaki, has started a process to ensure that all Black Sea coastal countries are actively and equally involved in shaping a common maritime agenda for the basin they share and that they cooperate further, including towards sustainable fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">A stakeholder conference on maritime affairs and fisheries in the Black Sea will take place in Bucharest in November this year. This joined-up approach can increase the possibilities for cooperation where there is a common interest between the European Union and its Black Sea partners in tackling the challenges facing the region, such as transport, environment, maritime and fisheries policy and education. We hope that this approach will also build increased levels of trust and confidence between the countries around the Black Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to review its interest in the region, including its strategic, political and economic dimensions, and to further discuss how best they can be achieved. In this endeavour, we count on the support of the European Parliament and look forward to future recommendations. Regarding the support, let me assure Parliament that we remain committed to the European Union’s strategy for the Black Sea region – but at the right time. In the meantime, we are working hard on the many elements I have mentioned. Listening to some of you, I had the feeling that issues such as the security of energy, regional cooperation and democratisation were considered to be non-existent because the Black Sea strategy is not there. That is not true: we are working hard on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I made a point about the Eastern Partnership and developing the kind of policy where we are indeed building the European Union within that region. The interesting point of our debates in this institution – but also with the Council members – is that there are a number of people calling for the strategy, the framework and the institutional framework and asking when those people will be invited by me to present some concrete ideas in addition to what we are doing – how we would like to see this strategy, the pillars, the structure. To tell the truth, there we are short of good and substantive ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I claim that the time we take to approach this issue seriously has not been lost. In the meantime, we will work on the Eastern Partnership; we will strengthen the relationships with our partners in the region; we will increase our support for cross-border cooperation and we will make sure that now, after the Lisbon Treaty, the European Union will be playing a more effective role in regional cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Black Sea Synergy of 2008 has not been the precursor of a more elaborate approach, as we, the Members who are located in that area, hoped for, but rather a time-buying mechanism to avoid just that: a more substantive approach towards that particularly important area of our continent. Primarily, the motivation is related, on the one hand, to the inherent complexities of the area and, on the other, to the care the EU is demonstrating not to upset important countries in the region, particularly Russia. Probably, the EU considers that the instrument of Eastern Partnership is already a sufficient annoyance to Russia – our main strategic partner in the east of the continent – to add to that a well defined strategy to deal with the area. Even the Black Sea Synergy was not conceived to be an efficient instrument, the proof of it being its minuscule ‘success’. Under the circumstances, I am afraid that it will take more time for the area to get a proper strategy, which other similar regions – see the Baltic Sea (Russia included) – already enjoy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

This is the first time that Parliament has had an opportunity to evaluate these talks and give the Commissioner and the whole Commission feedback.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan is an important partner for the EU and its Member States. It supplies EU countries with energy, and other products too, of course; but it is especially important for us as far as energy security is concerned. The benefits are obviously mutual, which is why these negotiations are being held. Let us also hope that the association agreements will bring stability and, at some stage, even eventual peace in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">These talks have obviously been overshadowed by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Unfortunately, association agreement negotiations will not be able to find a solution to the greatest cause of instability in the region. That is the task of the Minsk Group. Let us hope that our negotiations do not in any way cause problems for those talks. I do not suppose that that will be the case, anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the work of the Minsk Group accelerated. In recent times, it has come up with hardly anything. Of course, it has to be admitted that the parties in the dispute, Armenia and Azerbaijan, need to show greater political will, to achieve a peace agreement between the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the subjects being discussed during these negotiations include not only energy and economic issues, but many others as well. Human rights have a very essential role. The economy cannot be developed, and neither can cooperation, unless human rights are acknowledged and respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, in the matter of human rights, it has to be said that there are still major shortcomings. Even today, we have received news that people have been detained and house-to-house searches have been carried out without a warrant of any kind. Neither Parliament nor the Commission is able or willing to close its eyes to violations of this kind. We require Azerbaijan, which is a member of the Council of Europe, to comply with the human rights agreements to which it has committed itself. It still has much to do in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurovision Song Contest in Baku is another poignant issue, to some extent. It is an honour for Azerbaijan. Like all the other countries that have won the competition, Azerbaijan wants to do the job honourably. It has been proposed, however, that the contest should be boycotted. I myself am not in favour of that. I visited a school and asked young people what their opinion was of that, without saying what I myself thought. They wondered why we should boycott the competition if we wanted to hold the association agreement negotiations and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to focus attention on human rights. I hope that youth and student exchange programmes will be something in which the EU will invest. In the very same way that Azerbaijan itself has ... </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tomasz Piotr Poręba, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(PL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on Armenia that I prepared in the European Parliament is, in my view and in that of my political group, a significant and important report. Why is this the case? The reason is that we believe that all countries in the Southern Caucasus, including Armenia, would be more secure if they were closer to Europe, if they cooperated more with the European Union, and if they introduced European standards in their own countries. They would be safer not just from the point of view of the countries themselves, but also from the point of view of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While preparing this report, I visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, where I had meetings with authorities from both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia in order to obtain information on the ground in Armenia about relations between the countries in this region and to learn about the views of the Armenian authorities as regards the political situation in the area. It was important to me that the report that you have in front of you, which we are now debating and on which we will be voting tomorrow, should be completely objective and should present the whole complex situation in this region as well as a complete background to the conflict. It was also important that it should point to some optimistic objectives and that it should contain optimistic information showing that there is a possibility – sooner or later, depending on the authorities in that country – of better and more effective cooperation between Armenia and the European Union. Why is this important? It is important because the association agreement negotiations with Armenia that began in 2010 are making good progress. Since that time, 24 chapters have been closed and it would appear that at present, there are no issues that would bring about any untoward extensions to these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Armenia prepared a comprehensive reform strategy and then presented it for assessment by the European Commission, together with a request for support. As far as I know, Commissioner Štefan Füle and Prime Minister Sargsyan are currently working on a joint programme to improve and implement this strategy. We are counting on the European Parliament being kept informed on an ongoing basis about the progress being made in this work. There is no doubt that the Armenian authorities are facing many challenges and some painful reforms. It was very important to me that the report focused both on those areas where significant improvements had already been made, as far as the internal situation in Armenia is concerned, as well as on areas such as human rights or press freedom in its broadest sense, where improvements are being made but where more still needs to be done. It is only by doing this that good relations and a rapid conclusion to the negotiations with the European Union can be guaranteed. Recognition should certainly be given to the support provided by the Armenian authorities to the office for the protection of human rights, which enjoys considerable independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the issue of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, which is obvious to anyone who follows the situation in the Southern Caucasus. It is discussed in both reports, both in mine and in that of Anneli Jäätteenmäki. Parliament has emphasised the need to comply with the guidelines set out by the OSCE Minsk Group in its joint declaration of 10 July 2009 and has linked negotiations for association agreements with Azerbaijan and Armenia with reliable undertakings aimed at ending the conflict. For me, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that we, as the European Parliament, will not resolve this conflict and we will not be able to solve this problem. Everything depends on the two countries, on how they develop their relations. However, we here in the European Parliament ... </p>

<p class="contents">I welcome the interest and engagement demonstrated by the European Parliament in this regard. We have had an intensive and regular exchange with the two rapporteurs to prepare the two well-structured and comprehensive reports, for which I would like to thank Ms Jäätteenmäki and Mr Poręba.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of these reports comes at a moment when the relations of the European Union with the South Caucasus and, in particular, with Armenia and Azerbaijan, are under the spotlight. During the visit of the Armenian President Sargsyan to Brussels in March, and when I visited Baku to attend the Euronest plenary session two weeks ago, I conveyed two key messages to our interlocutors: first, our readiness to strengthen our links and to provide support, and second, our wish to see tangible progress on a number of issues, including deepened democracy, respect for human rights and conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Before providing comments on the reports, let me briefly give an update on the negotiations. There has been considerable progress since they were launched in July 2010. We had eight plenary meetings with Armenia, and five with Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of 28 chapters on sectoral and economic reform, we closed 24 chapters with Armenia and 13 with Azerbaijan. Discussions on the political as well as the justice, freedom and security chapters are well advanced, in particular, with Armenia. Let me also stress that we perceived a genuine commitment of our interlocutors to fruitful – although at times difficult – negotiations, and this is reflected in the number of chapters closed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the reports, I would like to say from the outset that we fully share the views of the rapporteurs that the association agreements currently under negotiation are fundamental and far-reaching tools for deepening our relations with the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the multilateral dimension of the Eastern Partnership, these agreements should also be instrumental in developing, in a regional context, a series of bilateral contacts between the two countries in a number of areas. At present, such contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan are almost non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also share with you my impressions on the two issues addressed in detail in the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on Nagorno-Karabakh, the European Union has recently expressed its concern at the slow progress in the peace negotiations and it called on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to step up their efforts to reach agreement on the ‘Madrid principles’ as a basis for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased tensions along the front lines add further concerns. We therefore urge the leaders on both sides to fully implement all commitments made in the Minsk Group framework. The European Union stands ready to continue to provide enhanced support for confidence-building measures and this will remain complementary to the Minsk Group framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has the capacities and experience to contribute to confidence-building measures on people-to-people contacts and on security. The European Union could also contribute to a number of initiatives, such as the mechanism proposed by the OSCE to investigate incidents along the lines of contact. We have underlined the need for unconditional/unrestricted access for European Union representatives to Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions. We continue to work on this with the Armenian and Azerbaijani leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is the issue of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. Armenia and Azerbaijan are committed to sharing values and principles with the European Union in this field and we should make every effort to stress to them the need to ensure that their countries fully comply with these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">An important test for Armenia will be the upcoming parliamentary elections in May and the presidential election next year. In the case of Azerbaijan, the European Union has clearly expressed the need for progress in democratic reforms in a number of areas. We also called for an invitation to be extended to the rapporteur for political prisoners of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our level of ambition is high in this exercise: on what we can offer, but also on what we expect from our partners. This is where the ‘more for more’ principle will fully apply.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me once again congratulate the rapporteurs for their reports, as well as the European Parliament for the interest and attention you have shown in these two countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Occupying territories and preventing refugees and internally displaced persons from returning to their homes is against European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Some believe that negotiations within the framework of the Minsk basic principles would bring an agreement to resolve this problem. In my view, the negotiations were not robust enough and did not bring the expected results. We will have to agree to disagree on the results of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe that the European Union should take a more active role in the settlement of this conflict and call on Armenia to withdraw its forces from the occupied territories in Nagorno-Karabakh, along with confidence-building measures and multinational peacekeeping operations. This is why I insist and reiterate that the Union should be involved in the negotiations using the experience of its Member States, and I also refer to the experience of the Baltic countries in the 1990s when it comes to holding – or not – a possible referendum in future.</p>
<p class="contents">On visa facilitation, I welcome the launch in March of the negotiations on the visa facilitation and readmission agreement, but our cooperation on mobility should go further. Once all the conditions are met we should aim for visa liberalisation. People-to-people contact is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan still has many challenges ahead, especially with regard to the judiciary, to the fight against corruption and organised crime, and, in particular, to implementing international law on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Many things are to be done and I would recommend focusing on high-level corruption cases, which are the test for both judges and politicians, and on improving transparency of public income and expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the short time that has elapsed, we could perhaps not only criticise but also commend the Balkan countries. But before that, Commissioner, I would like to commend you on your firm and credible approach to the two countries. First of all, we should welcome the efforts made by Armenia to reform its legislation. The aim of helping the most free and fair elections ever also deserves respect. On 6 May 2012, we shall see to what extent this ambition has turned into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress in the negotiations on the association agreement only shows how much Armenia is set on improving its relations with the EU. Azerbaijan is also showing signs that its relations with the EU are becoming a priority. The country is emerging as a strong ally with a growing strategic importance, not only in terms of energy, but also in terms of foreign policy and security.

This also includes implementing confidence-building measures such as general demilitarisation and a mechanism for active incident-prevention, and providing international security guarantees through the European Union’s direct and more active participation in the Minsk Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial progress has been made between the European Union and Azerbaijan on energy cooperation, where Azerbaijan is one of the EU’s main partners in safeguarding Europe’s energy security. Technical assistance must be provided in order to help Azerbaijan diversify its economy and bring the country into line with the European Union’s climate change objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the call to the Council, Commission and European External Action Service to include in the association agreement clauses and criteria on the protection of human rights, especially with respect to media freedom and the right to free speech and association, which reflect the principles enshrined in the constitutions of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the highest European and international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Support must also be given to the efforts aimed at Azerbaijan’s accession to the World Trade Organisation by providing the technical assistance necessary to prepare for the negotiations, and it needs to be encouraged to adopt the reforms demanded. This will enable Azerbaijan and Armenia – at the end of a reform process lasting many years – to gain access to the European internal market, which will contribute to boosting their imports and increasing investments, and will help their sustainable growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Armenia has made progress in democratisation, media freedom and human rights following the problems in the aftermath of the 2008 elections. However, we would expect the Armenians to make gestures on giving back the surrounding occupied territories, regardless of the ongoing negotiations with Nagorno-Karabakh. That would be an important step forward.</p>

I am especially glad that five major groups in this House have succeeded in including a reference in tomorrow’s vote to evictions and house demolitions, some of which are occurring in relation to the upcoming Eurovision song contest in Baku at the end of May. I am also glad that this Parliament is expressing its support for human rights activists who want to use the Eurovision song contest to improve human rights and the democratic record in Azerbaijan.</p>

The events in North Africa over the past months have shifted the vector of our interest towards the south. For this reason, we should be even more grateful for the report prepared by Mr Poręba.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Caucasian Gordian knot, Armenia is a key area, a focal point for all the problems in the region. Poverty, infrastructure and energy problems, a powerful Russian influence, unresolved conflicts with neighbours – these are just the start. For this reason, it is even more important to strengthen our involvement in the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy. More funds, greater support and regional exchanges; this is just the beginning, and the culmination must be assistance in resolving the Karabakh conflict. The end of this conflict would provide a centre of stability for the entire region and would finally put a limit on Russian influence. More than 17 years since the war ended, land designated as forming part of Armenian ethnic territory must form part of Armenia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having both countries associated with the European Union, along with the relevant legal and political convergence, economic modernisation and good accountable governance, are extremely important, both for the European Union’s foreign policy and the region. Europe’s more tangible political presence in this neighbouring region can help economic progress, respect for human rights, the fight against corruption and the rule of law – areas in which both countries need to catch up to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the unresolved conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh must not become a stumbling block for regional cooperation and hamper the deepening of the two countries’ relations with the European Union. Only a peaceful solution can be found to the conflict in accordance with international law and the Minsk Group agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Both countries must create mechanisms for building mutual trust and find communication channels with the help of the European Union and the international community. The European Union’s major role in the region compels us to be as careful and fair as possible in our assessments, so that our actions do not resemble those of a bull in a china shop, making matters worse instead of contributing to achieving a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I am expecting fair, transparent and democratic elections to be held on 6 May in Armenia, which will help the country’s European integration. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the European Parliament are being sent as election observers.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge both countries once again to sign the Statute of the International Criminal Court. I believe that the association agreement is a powerful instrument which the European Union can use to support the resolve for significant reforms and democratisation. These are the preconditions for paving the way to free trade and a visa-free regime with both countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since then, there has been some progress: negotiations on association agreements have started – as the reports point out – and a visa facilitation dialogue has been initiated, as has enhanced economic cooperation.

So far, the Union has played a modest role, initiating and funding confidence-building measures. At this stage, our Union can offer more, including participation in possible international peacekeeping missions and playing a leading role in the post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of the conflict-affected areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is consequently even more important that democracy should develop in the Caucasus region and that we should have close trading links with these countries and continued success with the energy projects we have undertaken, such as the Trans-Caspian pipeline, which opens up exceptionally broad opportunities for securing energy independence for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the most difficult issue in these countries’ bilateral relations is, of course, that of Nagorno-Karabakh, which also came to the fore during the Euronest meeting in Baku, in which I took part. This conflict is a very complex issue. Its solution is achievable gradually, step by step, adhering strictly at all times to international standards and, above all, territorial integrity. First of all, occupying forces must be withdrawn from the occupied territories of Nagorno-Karabakh, the use of force must cease, and genuine international peacekeeping forces must be established. They will have to ensure peace and safely return internally displaced persons and refugees to their homes. We must then conceive of measures to promote mutual trust between the peoples living in this territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh within an integral state may be the most appropriate solution to secure the development of the territory and peace in the long term. We have considerable resources in order to …</p>

If we want to finally achieve an end to the twenty-year occupation, we must also very clearly and unambiguously say these words – the key lies in Moscow. Secondly, I would like to say that the amendments to reports that were voted in refer very clearly to the fact that Armenia cannot sign the association agreement before it has withdrawn its troops from Azerbaijani territory; in other words, before it has ceased to occupy Azerbaijani territories. In my opinion, this is a very appropriate and fair solution. Today, the European Union has an historic chance to end this conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also important for the reason that if we are not there, then someone else will be. Nature abhors a vacuum; likewise, politics abhors a vacuum. If we are not there, then someone else will be, someone who cares much less than we do about democracy in those countries and who does not wish that those countries should look to the West.

Gradual steps to strengthen democracy and efforts to improve the situation of minorities in society give hope that both of these post-Soviet countries have the necessary potential for a closer partnership with the European Union. It is still risky to predict the future development of the Azerbaijani region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been under Armenian occupation for 20 years now, with all the associated consequences for more than one million Azerbaijani refugees, and for the population of the Nakhchivan region who, as a result of the occupation, have lost direct contact with their country. Therefore, negotiations on association agreements should be based on Minsk Group documents, with strong commitments by both countries to a civilised and peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem that places an emphasis, first and foremost, on the needs and interests of its population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union could have a balanced relationship with the two countries by bringing about a settlement between them and by ensuring that it is able to talk to both sides.

The negotiations on association agreements with Eastern Partnership countries are making good progress. A few weeks ago, the first association agreement in the region – the one with Ukraine – was initialled. Four other negotiation processes are well under way, and we have recently decided to launch the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement component with three countries. We stand ready to consider taking a similar decision on Azerbaijan as soon as it joins the World Trade Organisation, and we are indeed ready to assist in any way we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with you that the European Union has a number of core interests in Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in the region at large. I also agree with those of you who made the point that this is not about the competition between those two countries, nor is it about the debate on who is – or who is not – more important. All partners – large or small – are important to me and to my colleagues, and should be important to the European Union. These interests relate, in particular, to security and stability. Democratic reforms, energy and investments – those are the core interests we have in that region. I believe that the association agreements, once in force, will be one of our most effective and valuable tools in promoting a number of core European Union values, as well as in promoting economic integration and enhancing the mobility of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am glad to see that the European Parliament has also played an active role in closely monitoring the situation in the South Caucasus and, in particular, I am glad to see the progress that has been made in the negotiation of the association agreements. In recent months, you have adopted reports on the negotiations with Moldova and Georgia, and today on the negotiations with two additional countries. All included valuable recommendations and reflect the strong interest of the European Parliament in the implementation of the decisions of the Prague and Warsaw Eastern Partnership summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me assure you that I am committed to engagement. I am committed to progress that is beneficial to the people on the ground. The vacuum is what I will continue to fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The South Caucasus region is evolving as a result of debate and cooperation. It is becoming safer, and human rights are beginning to be respected there. It has been mentioned here, and I myself would also like to stress the fact, that Azerbaijan has been independent for 20 years. There have been improvements during those 20 years, but it is a short time in which to change an entire political system, a whole way of thinking and attitudes to human rights. That takes time and calls for cooperation: it needs the EU to emphasise the importance of human rights and democracy and to insist on improvements in these areas during the negotiations. In this way, the agreement will be established and people’s circumstances will improve and be made more stable, and, hopefully, peace will eventually be achieved. The requirement for any development is that the country’s tax revenues can be used constructively, in order to improve life on an everyday basis, and not for buying military technology and continuing a spiralling build-up of arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the co-rapporteurs for their help, constructive comments and amendments as well as for a straightforward and rational dialogue concerning these reports. After hearing all the interventions during today’s debate, I would like to say that there is a common thread that links them all: we are all saying and emphasising the fact that the European Union should strengthen its relations with the Southern Caucasus, that the EU should have a greater presence there and that it should show greater determination in building good relations with the countries in the Southern Caucasus region. I believe that these reports will be helpful in building good relations and good contacts with the Southern Caucasus and that this will be advantageous both for the countries in that region and for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly from my point of view, as the rapporteur of this report on Armenia, the upcoming elections on 6 May will constitute a real test of the Armenian authorities – a test of their will, desire, ambition and determination to create good relations with the European Union. If these elections are free, transparent and fair – and I believe they will be – this would be an important sign that this country really is taking its obligations seriously, obligations aimed at an association agreement, which would serve the interests of both the European Union and Armenia, being signed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank you for the assistance provided during the preparation of the report.

Armenia is a good example of this. This country, with a history reaching back to ancient times, is one of the most distant centres of European culture and civilisation. For this reason, an association agreement between the European Union and Armenia seems to be a natural process to strengthen bilateral relations. The difficult and tangled nature of the region’s history, with many tragic undertones, should not affect the vision that we have for future cooperation. Instead of criticising – where the criticism often stems from a failure to understand ethnic and historical interdependence in the Caucasus – the European Union should focus on providing multilateral assistance to Armenia so that this country can, in the foreseeable future, implement European standards that will enable it to form an association with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The right way to achieve this objective is to increase active participation by Armenia in multilateral parliamentary cooperation as part of the Euronest Assembly. This would be a good example of involvement in European values and principles, which are shared by most of Armenian society. The announcements by the Armenian authorities of democratic, transparent and free elections that are to take place there in May of this year should be treated as a gesture of goodwill and an expression of that country’s European ambitions. Union authorities should be tasked with strengthening this attitude and showing that decisions are being taken and challenges are being overcome that are bringing the goal, which is to return Armenia to the European fold, ever closer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, it is in the interest of the whole of the European Union to pay greater attention to this area and to focus increased financial and diplomatic resources on it. This is not an easy task. There is still a cold war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. This is why we should focus on resolving this conflict. The report presented to us makes no mention of attempts to resolve the conflict, nor does it make reference to the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is so tense that, from the beginning of March, there has been a concentration of Russian forces on the Azeri frontier. It is assumed that it will support the Armenian army if there is a conflict. Experience unfortunately tells us that, when discussing Armenian issues, it is now also necessary to speak to Russia. We should go to even greater lengths to become involved in this dialogue, to convince both sides of the need for an armistice. In addition – and this was emphasised in the report – support should be given to the development of civil society and non-governmental organisations in Armenia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title20"></a><a name="creitem20"></a>

In this context, I would like to highlight two points. In April 2012, we are assessing human rights in the world of 2010: we are considering something that should no longer be current. I would understand this if the report on human rights were drafted by students with no right to a fee. I do not understand, however, why the Council Secretariat only published the report in September 2011, and I have absolutely no idea why we are only discussing it in today’s plenary. My second comment concerns Belarus. With regard to human rights, Lukashenko’s regime has changed for the worse since 2010. I would therefore like to call upon the International Ice Hockey Federation not to organise this year’s World Championship in Belarus. Belarusians play good ice hockey and have the right to host this sport’s championship. Dictator Lukashenko, however, must not use this as proof that the world has accepted his government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, the German air force was testing techniques for large-scale attacks on the civilian population, which were perfected during the Second World War. Franco, for his part, was attacking Basque institutions and national identity, which remained one of his objectives throughout his whole dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Guernica is now a symbol of peace in the world, made stronger by Picasso’s famous painting, which should be exhibited in the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1977, the German State apologised to the Basque people for its part in that massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in Spain, far-right revisionist historians are denying the truth, and many politicians are quietly acknowledging that pro-Franco impunity was the key to Spain’s successful transition to democracy. Perhaps that is why the only judge who has tried to investigate the dictator’s crimes has been expelled from the legal profession.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore using this 75th anniversary as an opportunity to call for justice, an apology, and recognition for the victims. Seventy-five years later, it is vital that we settle our debt with the millions of people whose lives, dignity and freedoms were stolen from them by supporters of Franco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Party’s position, and that of its leader, changed from an extremely dangerous and violent abstention to a grovelling vote in favour. This alliance makes our Portuguese Parliament the first parliament to accept the humiliation of having one of its most important functions, for which the people elected it, taken away: deciding the country’s annual budget.

On the other hand, however, we must be mindful that repeated accusations against states, without any real evidence, also constitute an abuse. Romania, for example, was repeatedly accused of hosting secret CIA detention centres, whilst the only evidence for these allegations was a series of articles in the press. Parliamentary and civil inquiries into the matter have since proved that there have been no such detention centres. Therefore, I want to call attention to the fact that the truth about CIA detention centres will not be discovered through launching frequent and unfounded accusations, but through conducting a reasonable analysis of real and objective facts, which, at least in Romania’s case, disproved the existence of these detention centres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the case in Galicia, where 16 000 hectares have burnt this year and where the fires have razed to the ground areas of incalculable economic value, seven of them part of the Natura network. A month ago, this was how the Fragas do Eume national park, one of the main Atlantic forests in Europe, looked. Today, this is the forest’s bleak appearance. We therefore call on the Commission to promote common fire prevention policies and territorial policies to prevent land abandonment, and to ensure that the master plans to protect and conserve these ecosystems are implemented. We want to leave a green country for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an area of great natural importance, part of the Natura 2000 network. It is here in this forest, once protected by the Most Serene Republic of Venice, that for the first time – after a ban that has lasted for centuries – hundreds of deer will be hunted, under proposals from the provinces of Treviso and Belluno and the Veneto and Friuli regional administrations. Pregnant does, on the point of delivery, will also be brutally killed, as set out in the culling plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the pretext of overpopulation, disputed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and many other associations, the Italian authorities are giving the green light to these killings.

Meanwhile, the troika, of which the Commission is part, with the servile agreement of the Portuguese Government, believes that Portugal is on track. However, let us see what track that is: does increased debt and economic dependence, a deepening recession with the consequent rise in unemployment – which has already reached 15%, with over 200 000 job losses forecast for 2012 and 2013 – and increased poverty with a quarter of Portuguese people living on the poverty line mean that Portugal is on track? Do you believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the decline in the Portuguese standard of living, with an estimated 7.3% drop in private consumption in 2012, the theft of public sector workers’ and pensioners’ holiday pay and Christmas bonuses, and the freezing and cutting of wages is because Portugal is on track? Do you believe that the closure of multiple public health services with a view to their privatisation, as well as many other public services, and the increased number of Portuguese with nutritional deficiencies, particularly school-age children, is a sign that Portugal is on track? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
