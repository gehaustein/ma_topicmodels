In any case, personally, I was convinced that I was going to be the last President of the Millennium.

Mrs Doyle and other Members are right but the problem we are faced with in the Regional and Transport Committee, which is the committee responsible, is that at the very last minute we were asked for urgency by the Council because somebody, somewhere, realised that we needed a resolution from this House to carry on the particular fund in question. Therefore, the only way we could do that was by this very quick procedure, through the committee on Tuesday, by a letter from the President.</p>

<p class="contents">In 1997 an amendment to this Decision was presented which extended by two years the deadline for Member States to send their reports and the deadline for the Commission to draw up a progress report for Parliament and for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the common agricultural policy, the availability to everybody of reliable information for the purposes of decision making is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it must be a priority for the institutions to provide the means for this information to be ever more complete, reliable and quick, and therefore agricultural statistics must be ever more flexible, harmonious and coherent with other statistical fields with the possibility of incorporating new sources. To this end, we have to identify, firstly, the areas in which it is possible to implement rationalisation measures, secondly, areas where there are new and increasing needs, and thirdly, general principles in accordance with which actions are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it should not be necessary to point out that all the Member States should act in accordance with these intentions. However, this is not the case: this is a voluntary programme for the Member States. I would like to stress that it is not at all easy for this Parliament to understand that any Member State might say “I am not interested, I am not taking part”. The common agricultural policy belongs to all the Member States. It affects all of us. Therefore, I would like both the Commission and the Council to reconsider the matter and for the next proposal submitted to this Parliament to establish the obligatory nature of its application in all Member States, with a single legal basis in the statistical field.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect which I would like to point out to the Commission and the Council with regard to amendment 5, which I hope will be taken into account, given that the information requested in it, according to Regulation (EC) 1390/99, which entered into force on 23 November 1999, establishes in article 2 that “each Member State will provide the Commission with all the information classified by budgetary items which will be forwarded at the request of the Commission within 30 days”. Therefore, I request a specific commitment by the Commission that it will define each year, amongst the priority plans for technical action proposed to it by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, the things requested in our Amendments Nos 4 and 5, since otherwise, the codecision procedure would be delayed and it would become more difficult for the Member States to draw up their statistical reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to hear the Commission’s opinion with regard to this point in the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the things that I miss from the information we were given is the cost of this operation or what the cost would be if every Member State involved themselves in it. I do not suppose it is very big. Nevertheless the information is necessary for a Parliament discussing the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as the common agricultural policy develops from a situation in which we pay subsidies at the point of export or at the point of entry into intervention into a situation where we pay subsidies for individual animals on an acreage or the hectarage of crop planted, obviously it is extremely important that we know exactly how many animals there are in the Union, how many hectares and how many olive trees and all the rest of it. All that information is extremely important. It is extremely regrettable if we, at European level, the institutions who organise the common agricultural policy on which the farmers of the Union depend for their livelihood, cannot obtain correct information on which to base an effective policy. It is very hard to understand why we do not have better cooperation from all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When we expand the European Union, or even without expansion, we will not retain all the provisions of the present policy. Nevertheless, we will need this information so that we are able to extend some sort of assistance on a reasonable basis to the new countries of the Union where food production and agricultural production will increase by 50 per cent what we have in the Union today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also advisable to remember that in the Court of Auditors’ report, which has just come out and which was debated this week, we did not find in the whole agricultural sector any indication of massive racketeering or fraud on a large scale but we notice that there seem to be an awful lot of little problems with the number of livestock and the amount of hectarage for area aid and so on. There are small errors over a very wide area and that is a serious problem that we have to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that in the new Europe it is going to be important for farmers to base their levels of production on the projected quantities that will be produced in the Union. That cannot happen if we do not know the statistics of the agricultural industry. Increasingly, rather than screaming at the institutions of Union to solve the problems, farmers will have to come together and try to calculate what the needs of the market are and produce for those needs. That does not mean that we want to bring an end to subsidisation. For example, there is the pigmeat industry where we produce 18 million tons of pigmeat annually and we end up in a situation where there is a million tons in surplus. Prices collapse, there is terrible hardship and indeed terrible profiteering by middlemen. If we had good statistics, we would be able to deal with a problem like that before it arose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A viable system for statistics is an important basis for making good decisions. Statistics have to be comprehensive, reliable and consistent. The report quite clearly explains the legal basis of statistics, especially in Amendments Nos 2 and 3, which specify the Community’s share of the advance. Politically, the most important message is contained in Amendments Nos 4 and 5, which urges the practice of cross-tabulating subsidies received according to, inter alia, farm surface area. This information will be especially important when we consider the social side of agricultural subsidies. It would be difficult to support a subsidy scheme that channelled most of the aid to the large farms in the best agricultural regions. We have no data on this, but have to be content with the rumours that 80% of aid would go to 20% of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 emphasised the importance of statistics in connection with enlargement towards the east. This is a very important consideration that still means much work for the EU and the applicant countries. The problems over statistics for the applicant countries will not be resolved through this report. Problems have continued since the land register began to function. Embarking on eastward enlargement without any information on its effect on the budget would be political suicide. It does not help much, though, if our current data on expenditure is based on mistaken or unreliable data.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important aspect of statistical data on the European farmer is the reference yield. When Finland became a Member, as a result of poor yield in previous years, we had to be satisfied with a figure that did not reflect the truth in normal years. These reference yields should be raised to a realistic level as soon as possible, or we should start to reconsider the whole basis of their use and the idea of a drop in the price of grain as compensation for hectarage aid. We cannot undertake to subsidise producers in regions of highest yield in Europe for years and years on account of price reductions that have sometimes taken place in the past.

<p class="contents">European agriculture is not uniform. On the contrary, it is extremely diverse. It is therefore essential that statistics are accurate enough in terms of land, and compiled in a harmonised way, for us to be able to obtain judicious analyses by production type and by ecosystem. In 1996, the European Parliament adopted a report by Mr Jové Perez whose proposals aimed to make European statistics much more accurate and reliable. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission’s rather unambitious proposal that has been submitted to us has taken no account of it. This is why we shall support all of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as well as the one by Mr Jové Perez. Indeed, it seems essential to us that the wealth of information stemming from the implementation of the CAP aid should be made use of as a source of statistics. The cost to the Community budget would be almost nothing and statistical secrecy would be guaranteed through the data being incorporated. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the concern that led our group to table an amendment yesterday concerning the traceability of beef and veal because, as a result of the CAP aid, all animals in the European herd must be identified. This applies to abattoirs, too, for reasons of food and animal safety. I have not yet understood why the Commission has not accepted that, as of 1 January, these two facts, which have already been made compulsory across the Community, should be used to enable the operational start of traceability. It is quite inconsistent to postpone the establishment of compulsory labelling of beef and veal for another year and, at the same time, to condemn France’s application of the precautionary principle, precisely because there is no such compulsory labelling. </p>
<p class="contents">If the free movement of products is not accompanied by rigorous labelling, consumers will think it is a confidence trick. It is regrettable that Commissioner Byrne does not employ his zeal in the service of the health and the interest of European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, statistics often have different interpretations which can mean just what we want them to mean. If this is the case, then inconsistent statistics will only exacerbate the problem. This is why I also agree that statistics on the movement, policies and trade of agricultural products must be as consistent as possible. It would be ideal if each State did not, statistically at least, paint a different picture of our agricultural economy. Then, despite any diverse interpretations, we would at least have one true common version of the facts which would help those wishing to examine in closer detail what those statistics actually represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, therefore, that we should adopt the regulation, and I also agree with the comments on the amendments which have been made so that the Commission can see to it that the statistics paint as uniform and reliable a picture as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a sign of foresight, but it also shows that developments have been so rapid in recent years that standing still really means going backwards. This area can justly be described by the phrase ‘never finished, always on the way’. The European Union ought, as quickly as possible, to be in possession of common statistical material which is comprehensive in all areas. The Commission says that the Community’s agricultural statistics should continue to be adapted in the years 2000-2002. This means that we are talking here about extending these. If for a moment we look back to 1957 when the Treaty of Rome came into being, it was in fact the agricultural sphere which was the first big area upon which agreement was reached. Today – nearly 43 years later – no completely satisfactory statistics have been established for this area. The debate this week about the registration of animals showed very clearly that 12 out of 15 countries had not even begun preparations for this work. Things are naturally interconnected. Without registration, careful statistics cannot be kept and there are therefore, of course, opportunities for a series of errors regarding payments. </p>
<p class="contents">The Community makes contributions to offset the Member States’ expenditure in connection with implementing the relevant arrangements. It is therefore necessary that the Commission should now do some tightening up. It cannot be the slowest countries which are to set the pace. The Commission ought to set the agenda to a much greater degree and lead the Member States in accordance with the common resolutions. How can we envisage re-establishing consumer confidence in food following all the scandals when the EU cannot even implement its own resolutions? Food safety, risk assessment and the very concept of safety are such important areas that there is no avoiding them nowadays. Allow me, therefore, quietly to ask: when are we to put our own house in order? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there is no reason to hesitate. The future belongs to those who prepare themselves for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am able to inform you that the Council has obviously adopted our demand to introduce this system by 1.9. This represents a small victory for the European Parliament as far as the timeframe is concerned. However, it did not reach this decision under the codecision procedure. This would have meant it also having to adopt all the other proposed amendments that we voted on here yesterday in the simplified procedure. Then all our proposed amendments would have been adopted in the codecision procedure. Instead of which, the Council decided, under the old regulation 820/97, in accordance with Article 19 of the implementing rules, that the Member States now have the facility to continue with the voluntary system until 1.9.2000. I do not consider this to be the right strategy either. It does, however, go some way towards meeting European Parliament requirements. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, we are now going to continue with the codecision procedure for the other proposed amendments, which we voted on yesterday, for this process will run on after 1.1.2000. The Council must give its reaction to this. If it fails to adopt our proposed amendments then we will become involved in a conciliation procedure. All the other matters that we want to include in this regulation will therefore still be a matter for debate. I hope that we will be able to persuade the Council to adopt our proposals in this area too, and that it allows reason to prevail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It foresees adoption according to the codecision procedure. The proposal submitted today for your approval is the first example insofar as agricultural statistics are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for her excellent work and, in particular, for her cooperation with the Council and the Commission on this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased about the global support expressed in the report for the draft Council and Parliament decision. The background is Council Decision 96/411(EC) on improving Community agricultural statistics. It has put at the Commission's disposal a flexible tool which allows it to adapt statistical applications to changes in information needs. This has helped to adapt the system of Community agricultural statistics to changes in the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the European Parliament and the Council the Commission has presented an overview of the actions undertaken during the period 1996-1999 in different areas. The overall assessment of these actions by the Commission is positive. However, the process of adapting national statistical systems to the needs arising from the reform of the common agricultural policy has not yet been completed. The Commission has therefore proposed to extend for a further three years, with some minor changes, the validity of Decision 96/411(EC). The changes are mainly aimed at either simplifying the implementation of this action programme or at reducing the delay for paying the Community contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that this new decision enters into force as soon as possible in order to avoid a vacuum in the present legislation. An effort should be made to adopt this proposal after first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns Mrs Redondo Jiménez's report, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendment No 4, even in its new, modified version. This amendment would still imply some new obligations for Member States which have not yet been discussed in the Council. This would certainly prevent the adoption of the proposal in the Council at first reading. Nevertheless, the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that the additional information requested by this amendment would indeed be useful in order to have a better idea of the distribution of aid paid in the context of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore commit itself to include such actions in the next technical programmes, starting from 2001, in view of encouraging progress in this area. We hope that this may reassure the European Parliament about our intentions and may lead Mrs Redondo Jiménez to withdraw this amendment in order to allow the proposal to be adopted at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Also, Amendment No 5, which would cause No 4 to lapse – which is the one that I hope the Commission will accept – only affects the Commission, not the Council. Its content is already regulated by the new Regulation 2390/99, which will be coming into force. Furthermore, the amendment does not include any additional obligation for the Commission.

I had actually anticipated having less time, which means that I can make a few additional comments and still keep to my time.</p>
<p class="contents">Hops are a special kind of plant.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">After all, they add flavour and wort to this important popular foodstuff we call beer.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Truth is to be found not just in wine but also in beer. This is particularly important in the case of Bavaria, the land I come from and where this foodstuff we call beer has had an important role to play, both in terms of development down through the ages and the population’s outlook. Weißbier is, of course, a special kind of beer; it is well known in Munich and many people enjoy the taste. It is true that hops would grow almost anywhere but it takes people with special qualities to give the hops the care they need, so as to ensure a successful crop. There are a number of sayings about this, such as <span class="italic">Der Hopf ist ein Tropf</span> (hops are little rascals), which may prove rather difficult to translate but literally means: hops are a fickle crop that rewards careful tending particularly well but also makes one pay for sloppy work. Hops also expect a daily visit from the master. What all this amounts to is that hops are a very labour-intensive crop and therefore tend to be more widespread amongst people of an industrious bent. That explains why a large hop cultivation area has grown up where I come from.</p>
<p class="contents">In central Bavaria, the Hallertau, a large hop cultivation area – in fact the largest in the world, because approximately one quarter of production derives from the Hallertau – has been developing over the last 150 years or more. Of course that is why this issue is of particular significance for Bavaria and for myself as a native of Bavaria.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to again emphasise the fact that hops and beer made from hops could be said to stand for sociableness, for relaxation even. Incidentally, hops are also used for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Bavaria is primarily famous for being the land of beer, but also for being the land of tradition and progress. You are bound to have often heard it said that tradition and progress are rated particularly highly in Bavaria. Indeed, the lederhosen and laptop saying is often quoted by Bavaria’s leader Mr Stoiber. Bavaria is not just famous for the Oktoberfest in Munich but also for its high tech.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not without reason that the world famous University of Brewing of Munich-Weihenstephan is located in Bavaria. It has disseminated a great deal of knowledge to the world and has heavily influenced both hop cultivation and beer production in the far-flung corners of China and Russia, and even in the USA. Hence another saying: <span class="italic">Hopfen und Malz, Gott erhalt’s</span> (hops and malt, may God preserve them). This is important, also with regard to the regulation put forward by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I had a few other comments I wanted to make but I must keep within my time. I now come to the regulation and the report. It all boils down to the fact that many provisions in this area can no longer be used owing to their no longer being valid or due to the implications of the common organisation of the markets for hops. What it amounts to is that there is no longer a requirement to draft a major report annually, rather, owing to the fact that grants have been established for a period of five years, a report only has to be submitted once every five years from now on. Commissioner, I consider this plan to be right-minded, but with one minor reservation. It is only right, in view of the vast experience we have accumulated in Bavaria, that we should also pay a little more attention to the situation there, hence my suggestion that we must ensure that, as is already the case, the annual collection of data relating to the development of the areas under cultivation, demand, the spread of different types, prices, and also cultivation development, proceeds uninterrupted in the individual Member States, and that this information is made available to all concerned on an annual basis. I have obtained the Commission’s consent for this to be done over the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I have put forward two amendments and I call upon Parliament to vote in favour of them. I know, however, that the Commission does not look very kindly upon these proposed amendments. However, Parliament is something of a different kettle of fish to the Commission in my view. That is why I am asking for your support.</p>

<p class="contents">I shall now come to the point. Hops are not a typical enough example for us to understand the importance of the common agricultural policy for farmers in the European Union. They do, however, show the extent to which it actually helps our farmers. As Mr Mayer said, hops are a traditional product which is particularly important to the quality of beer produced, although production is very limited; some 4 000 hectares of land throughout the whole of Europe. Yet a sufficient number of farming families in the countries where hops are produced, particularly in Bavaria, make their living from that product alone. These families should not be left to the mercy of continual price falls, neither should they be forced to desert specific rural areas because of difficulties arising from irregularities within the market. There have been a number of changes to the main regulation relating to this particular product as a result of the market fluctuations and the changing needs of farmers, the most recent being the Council decision to set a uniform level of aid to producers for a period of five years. </p>
<p class="contents">This latest decision alters the obligations of the Commission arising from the previous regime, that is of having to grant annual aid<span class="bold">,</span> and Members States no longer need to grant aid for setting up production teams. This development means that certain articles of the old regulation need to be revoked which, rightly so, is carried out in the new regulation for which we will be voting, together with Mr Mayer’s amendments, noting that the proposed regulation will not in any way affect the budget.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very pleased that our proposal for changing the way in which the market for hops is organised has met with a positive reception. The Commission’s proposal is, of course, aimed at removing those stipulations which are no longer valid, either because deadlines have run out or because of previous changes to the common regime under which hops are organised. These changes must be implemented before the basic regulation is consolidated. </p>
<p class="contents">Owing to the fact that the Council has resolved that the level of support is to remain constant for a period of five years, the Commission does not consider that it is necessary to submit a report every year on the situation concerning the production and marketing of hops. The Commission therefore considers that Article 11 can be removed. According to Article 18 of the proposal, we shall, however, be presenting, by 1 September 2000, a thorough assessment of the situation regarding the production and marketing of hops. I am therefore afraid that the European Parliament’s two amendments complicate the text unnecessarily and that the requirement to receive information each year is already covered by the new proposal. This information will also be made available on the Internet. That is why the Commission cannot adopt these amendments in this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it seems that you are asking me to speak on Tajikistan instead and, as I have five minutes, I shall try to be as clear as possible about an issue that is perhaps rather esoteric and complicated. It concerns exceptional aid to Tajikistan which is, as you know, a small country located between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China and Afghanistan. </p>
<p class="contents">There is a history to this issue and really what I would like to do today is to close a subject that began in 1991 with a loan of EUR 1200 million to the Newly Independent States when the Soviet Union collapsed. The loan has been repaid by all of the States apart from three. In 1997, three States were experiencing difficulties and were seriously behind in their repayments: Georgia, Armenia and Tajikistan. Thus the Parliament was informed in 1997 of a proposal by the Commission, which aimed to reschedule and restructure these three countries’ debts. It was therefore decided to put in place two types of financial assistance. On the one hand there would be loans – at the time EUR 245 million had been earmarked for loans to these three countries – and on the other hand, a gift of EUR 130 million, whose main objective was to reduce the burden of debt and to improve the ability of these countries to repay. </p>
<p class="contents">1997 was also marked, and this is the crux of the issue, by a civil war in Tajikistan, a terrible civil war between the reigning power and the Islamic opposition. Parliament then proposed, on the basis of Mr Kittelmann’s report, to defer aid to Tajikistan and that is why, two years later, now that the situation has returned to normal, we are being asked today to reopen the matter. In fact, although the situation in Tajikistan has remained highly critical and worrying, in terms of politics as well as economics, it has gradually become more stable. There has been an agreement between the different parties, which has been implemented and universally respected, even if security in the country is still subject to caution due to the presence of warlords and the powerful wave of Wahabi fundamentalism in Afghanistan. In terms of economics, the country has made great efforts under the auspices of the IMF and is benefiting from a structural adjustment facility provided by that organisation. </p>
<p class="contents">We, the European Union, are therefore being asked to re-establish contact with Tajikistan and to implement a restructuring of the debt as today, around EUR 73 million is still outstanding. What the Commission is proposing is actually to repeat what was done for Georgia and Armenia, which was to make provision for a new loan which would enable Tajikistan to repay the previous one but on much more favourable terms in order to give this country some breathing space, and to make provision for a gift of EUR 35 million for the period 2000-2004, in order to reduce the burden of debt. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal is extremely contradictory. We are in fact being asked to make a loan of EUR 75 million and a gift of EUR 35 million and now we see that no more budgetary funds are available for donations and that, in 1999, we only budgeted for the donations granted to Armenia and Georgia, donations which are due to end in 2001. </p>
<p class="contents">As a result and quite logically, we, the Committee on Industry, within whose competence this matter essentially falls, have been told by the Committee on Budgets that under no circumstances could we endorse donations which have not been budgeted for today and which have not been provided for in the financial perspective, particularly in Category 4, which, as you know, is already under pressure through trying to finance Kosovo. Therefore, the compromise which we have reached with the Committee on Budgets consists effectively of only keeping the loan of EUR 75 million whilst agreeing – a position of the Committee on Industry which I think has been understood by the Committee on Budgets – that Tajikistan should also be able to benefit from supplementary aid in order to reduce the monthly debt repayment of EUR 200 000 which it cannot afford. </p>
<p class="contents">Tajikistan is, in fact, the poorest of the Newly Independent States and the one that we absolutely have to stabilise because, rather like Chechnya and for other reasons besides, it is a country that could endanger the whole region, particularly because of its strategic position with regard to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are very rich countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We have consequently tabled a series of amendments. Firstly, amendments that endorse the donation; then amendments which point out to the Council and the Commission their contradictions by telling them that it would be desirable to grant direct aid, but by financing it under another line, and here I am thinking of TACIS; and finally, amendments concerning conditions: monitoring the way the funds are used, the political and democratic conditions and the monitoring of the Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country failed to grasp how to employ the financial aid provided so far in a targeted manner. The situation has only calmed down to some extent over the last few months, once the warring parties had ceased hostilities and resolved that their next step would be to form a coalition government.</p>
<p class="contents">General free elections are set for March 2000. The international donor community, which includes Swiss organisations for the most part, is now prepared to carry on where it left off delivering financial aid, but with certain provisos. Now that the situation has abated and there are more favourable prospects for future progress overall, the Savary report now attempts to provide renewed support for the macroeconomic financial aid for this country in the form of loans. We hope that this will make it sufficiently clear to Tajikistan that it needs to improve its state machinery by embracing democratic development and undertaking the necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the financial aid in the form of loans should only be granted if there is a real possibility of the European Union being able to properly monitor the situation, if the process of national reconciliation continues and the elections, in particular the parliamentary elections set for March, are free and democratic. As Mr Savary rightly said, this is also what we aim to achieve with proposed Amendments Nos 8 and 9, to which we give our unequivocal support. If Tajikistan’s creditworthiness is to be restored, then the proposal in Budget 2000 is also to be welcomed. The rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has just confirmed to me that as far as this is concerned, a commentary is to provide for a particular form of financial aid to be made available again under the TACIS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to say that the PPE group supports this report notwithstanding all the associated risks. It represents a renewed, hopefully successful attempt to resume and promote economic and technical cooperation with Tajikistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, this will not solve any problems within Tajikistan. The loan only prevents the outstanding debts from continuing to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Central Asia, the majority of whose population is Turkish-speaking and a small part of which is Iranian-speaking, was conquered in the previous century by the Russian tsarist empire. This empire did not look for colonies far from home or overseas, like most Western European States, but close by. Although they were decolonised in 1922, they have remained linked to Russia in the form of Federal States of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The boundaries drawn by Stalin between the various linguistic and cultural regions in the ’20s and ’30s are now state borders. This prolonged European influence means that we in the European Union should feel especially responsible for the vicissitudes of the five States which appeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="contents">The economy and environment are in a sad state of affairs in all fifteen States. Authoritarian regimes have come to power and leave little or no scope for political opponents. By means of referendums <span class="italic">and</span> intimidation, some presidents have their periods of office extended by ten years, without there being rival candidates. In this respect, Tajikistan is no exception. </p>
<p class="contents">Should European money be spent on a country like this? In general, my group is not in favour of funding undemocratic regimes. All too often, we have noticed that they receive funding in the expectation that they will regard this money as a reward for taking small steps towards greater democracy and human rights and as an encouragement to take further such steps. In practice, however, this method does not work, as we have since found out in Turkey and Russia. The funding is received, but the situation does not improve. </p>
<p class="contents">With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan has reverted to the situation in the nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth century. There are several, regionally powerful families and groups which are fighting each other in a situation where warlords seize upon political and religious differences as an excuse to justify armed action. The fate of Tajikistan largely depends upon what is happening in its immediate surroundings, such as the hopeless, violent conflict in Afghanistan. A large proportion of the Tajikistani population lives in north-east Afghanistan, the area which is not in the hands of the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">The North of Tajikistan stretches out as far as the densely populated Fergana Valley which is partly located in Uzbekistan and is completely integrated into the economy and road network of this neighbouring country. As a frontline area flanked, on the one hand, by the Russian sphere of influence and, on the other hand, by Islamic fundamentalism in Afghanistan, the present Tajikistani State has little chance of survival. </p>
<p class="contents">The only reason to inject European funding into Tajikistan despite all this is that funding increases the chance of survival of the Tajikistani population and offers more chance of peace than there would be without such aid. This is the reason why my group can nevertheless agree with the proposals made in the Savary report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is both for reasons concerning the choice of this country and out of more general considerations involving financial aid. </p>
<p class="contents">Although, of course, we have nothing against the sovereign State of Tajikistan, we nevertheless do not think that European States should drop their priorities, or to be more precise, the priority that they set a long time ago on the subject of cooperation. This priority has now been in force for more than a quarter of a century through the Lomé Agreements. </p>
<p class="contents">For obvious reasons, which concern history as well as geography, Europeans felt it necessary to embark, throughout the 1970s, on a major course of cooperation with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific in a way which is, moreover, highly original, known as the Lomé Agreements, which enable us to offer our Southern partners the benefits of stable prices for the produce which constitute their essential resources, protecting them from all-out free trade. Today we see only too well how this ruins the weakest economies. </p>
<p class="contents">Now under the battering, not from globalisation but from the globalist ideology, which European countries have accepted without closer examination, we have seen the ACP agreements being slowly dismantled over several years, their basic principles denied and, above all, we have seen reductions in several European countries’ contributions to the EDF. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, at the same time, so-called exceptional financial aid to the most diverse countries in the world is multiplying, without any overall plan emerging, which means that our cooperation policy is nothing but a vague, huge scratching of the surface or, to sum it up, it is no longer a policy at all. </p>
<p class="contents">To this particular consideration we can add a second. Tajikistan may have been spared the economic problems described in the report, moreover like so many other countries in the world, but it is nevertheless the victim of an ill-considered opening up of its borders and of the huge game waged by empires. </p>
<p class="contents">For our part, the best solution we can see would be to restore a new world trade order, which respects the sovereignty of States, their pace and their modes of development, and which also respects their traditions, traditions which we will not be able to make vanish with a wave of a magic wand just by imposing an election, human rights and what we quite hastily call democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only last week, President Ragmanov called for parliamentary elections to be held next spring. After months of tug-of-war between the government and the opposition, agreement has finally been reached regarding the new electoral law. I should point out, however, that these developments mark only the beginning of the democratisation process. Tajikistan still shows features which are incompatible with a democratic constitutional state. Indeed, the downside of the present positive developments is that during the next elections, a number of parties will remain on the sidelines. They are excluded from participating. This is hardly surprising as permission to participate in elections is still in the hands of former communists. This remark regarding Tajikistan’s democratic status does not detract from the fact that quite a few changes have already taken place. As such, international organisations and bilateral donors no longer see good reason for suspending aid to Tajikistan. Even the European Commission, with the proposal it is making, seems to think it should put its oar in. However, the Commission is losing sight of one important factor. Earlier this year, the three institutions of the European Union concluded the interinstitutional agreement for a period of seven years, stipulating the financial ceilings for the various policy areas. I would like to remind the Commission of this. </p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal to grant aid to Tajikistan, this agreement is not given much consideration. Neither the urgent appeal by the IMF and World Bank to the European Union to increase aid to Tajikistan nor the argument of moral duty in the light of Tajikistan’s debts to the Union are in themselves good enough reasons to grant aid. We are first of all faced with the European Union’s financial limitations. The above agreement does not allow for making gifts to Tajikistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have recent experiences of entering into financial commitments which we cannot honour, as illustrated in the reconstruction of Kosovo. The Commission has pledged a sum of EUR 500 million while the Member States do not want to make the necessary increase in the European budget at this stage. A vague declaration of intent has since been drafted by the Council to prevent similar problems from occurring in future, but it remains to be seen what will come of this. Kosovo is no better off at the moment. Aid has been reduced to EUR 360 million and also spread over several years. </p>
<p class="contents">This incident has given me grave concerns regarding the Member States’ willingness to make concessions once again within the context of aid to Tajikistan, even if only relatively small amounts are involved. Member States find it hard to sell the idea within their own countries if the outcome of the negotiations at the Berlin Summit are undermined by reality. Apart from a limited budget, the European Union has little political interest in Tajikistan. The geographical remoteness makes it impossible to have any real influence on the democratisation process. </p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union has an interest in being surrounded by large, stable regions, the tools it has available in order to achieve this are still very limited. All this does not mean that we cannot do anything at all for Tajikistan. On humanitarian grounds, I do agree with special aid as far as the loan component is concerned, but the gift component should be scrapped for the reasons I have outlined above. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to urge the Commission to ask Tajikistan’s bilateral donors and the Member States to grant special aid to this country on an individual basis. After all, the scope of the budget of the national Member States is, politically speaking, less of a sensitive issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to strongly advise the Commission, out of moral considerations, to resume the projects under TACIS for Tajikistan as soon as possible. In this respect, we have to monitor the situation closely in order to ensure that the money ends up where it is needed, namely with the Tajikistani population, which is suffering under grinding poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, we passed the budget yesterday and the steps that you decided ought to be taken in Category 4 will be very important in terms of Europe’s future. Commissioner, we are today discussing a form of special aid that will serve, in essence, to promote the stabilisation of a part of the world which could cause problems for us too, if we fail to get involved there. It is our duty to ensure that in Tajikistan, Armenia and Georgia, greater store is set by democracy, the market economy and security issues in future. There was severe hyperinflation in Tajikistan during the civil war and the country’s production output was down by two-thirds. One can only imagine what kind of impact this has on family units and individuals living in such a country. In 1997 there was economic growth again of an unprecedented 1.7%. National economic growth of production output was 5.3%; the starting point being a very low base level of course, as I have already mentioned. In December 1998 inflation fell to below 3%, i.e. it was possible to detect a degree of stabilisation here as well, and in the 1998 financial year the balance of payments including invisible trade rose from 5.5 to at least 15.2% of Gross Domestic Product. The fact that the country has outstanding debts totalling USD 1,263 million, that is to say, 98% of GDP, is, of course, a major problem; it is clear that the situation has been pushed to the limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Tajikistan is the poorest country amongst the Newly Independent States, it is up to us to combat the poverty in which the children and family units live there, and particularly in the run-up to Christmas, it behoves those of us that live in comfort to think of those that do not enjoy the standard of living that we do today. I therefore believe that we need to have clearly defined programmes which have certain conditions attached, and of course that usage of these programmes must be founded on existing legal bases. What we are most concerned about here is ensuring that the budgetary control stipulations are adhered to.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we must also realise that the grants that are provided must be made conditional on orderly elections taking place. Elections are prospectively set for March 2000 and what we are concerned about is giving Tajikistan the incentive to push democracy through. It is important from the point of view of the people for disputes not to be dealt with on the streets or in a civil war but in the parliaments between the different groups playing by the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Europe could serve as a very useful model for all the regions in question, with a view to achieving a functioning market economy, that is to say a socio-economic market economy, establishing democratic conditions and seeing to it that the citizen can rest assured that conflicts will be dealt with in the parliaments and that there will be security, and I believe that we need to export our concept of security rather than import crime from these countries. Whilst we might well feel ourselves to be secure here in this Parliament, in fact four women were murdered a few days ago in the vicinity of Strasbourg. So even if we suppose ourselves to be secure, we should still not let a single day pass without ensuring people’s security in their daily lives, both in Europe and in countries such as Armenia and Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to conclude by extending my sincere thanks to all my fellow MEPs and also people that I work alongside, because it is quite evident that we are more than willing to take on responsibilities outside Europe and that we worry about peace in this world. That is why I was particularly delighted that we were able to hand our President the Bethlehem light of peace yesterday. I hope that peace will be with us over the Christmas period and that we also have before us the prospect of living in peace in the new millennium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the First World War, in 1916, my grandfather was a prisoner of war working on the railways in what used to be Russia-Central Asia, and he has often told me that he was only able to survive these difficult years on account of the hospitality and helpfulness of the people of Tajikistan.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not why I am so keen to support Tajikistan’s cause, rather, unlike Mr Blokland, I believe that it is an issue that is of direct concern to us. Tajikistan is situated in an area enclosed by China and Russia, which are at odds in this region, and by the Islamic world and the Caspian Sea, where there are immense deposits of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this region represents the Balkans of the future, a Balkans in microcosm, and that is why it is in our vital interest, particularly as a number of nuclear powers are established there, to stabilise this region and prevent ethnic conflicts taking place there from having an impact on the entire world.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that we need to help Tajikistan on its difficult way ahead by providing it with a loan, but also with outright grants, it being clear, in this respect, that we will have to call upon the Member States as our own budget will not accommodate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we must demand democracy and the rule of law but, at the same time, we must not apply uncalled-for standards. For centuries, Tajikistan was subjected to colonial exploitation and for eighty years it was brutally suppressed by Soviet Communism. Today this small mountain race is making its way with difficulty and must not be made subject to European standards. We must apply the same standards that we apply to developing countries; after all, we have been supporting the countries of Africa on the road to democracy for decades now, and the situation there still leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">We have only been supporting Tajikistan for a few years now. Therefore, whilst we must demand certain rules of the game, we must also be patient towards the people of Tajikistan, heavily promote the elections to take place in the spring and recognise that this is not just an act that will do honour to Europe, rather it is in Europe’s own best interests to bring peace to this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the necessary reforms within the institutions and the EU Member States. Secondly, the enlargement of the European Union of the 15 and the associated discussion about the borders of Europe and the European Union, which we demanded, and which has been taken up by President Prodi. Thirdly, the role of a self-assured, dynamic European Union in the world. Fourthly, boosting public confidence in the realisation of these goals and in our work. </p>
<p class="contents">Extending a special financial aid package to Tajikistan is part of the growing responsibility we have for the democratic and peaceful development of world politics based on the recognition of human rights. The extraordinary financial aid package for Armenia and Georgia adopted on 17 November 1997 also allowed for the possibility of providing Tajikistan with a similar aid package, as soon as this country – to amplify the comments made by Paul Rübig – reaches agreement with the IMF. This agreement is now in place. Following two emergency loans, which were granted after the conflict in December 1997 and April 1998, the IMF approved a three-year programme for Tajikistan worth USD 128 million in June 1998, in order to consolidate the stabilisation successes and achieve sustained growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, on 11 December 1998, on the initiative of the IMF and the World Bank, a meeting of the Consultative Group was called in order to improve access to the financial facilities that these institutions provide for the benefit of Tajikistan and other Newly Independent States particularly hard hit by the external effects of the Russian crisis. That is why it is right and proper, for the sake of our own needs, but also of our responsibility on the world political scene, which will undoubtedly increase, to lend our support to this report, together with the amendments today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, permit me, as I am the last speaker and also as I am a newcomer amongst the last speakers in this Parliament, to provide a little more food for thought. Firstly, I would just like to make clear, and I believe I am expressing exactly what many people feel here, that I am pleased, that we are pleased, to be able to participate in this process here in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although we know where there is still room for improvement, we are doing sound work that is growing in importance. We can only do this work, however, because we are accompanied and supported by competent, committed, reliable colleagues and parliamentary employees in our groups and in our committees as well as in the course of everyday parliamentary life. Thank you to all those who support us and assist us in our work!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express two further wishes, since we are fast approaching Christmas. Let us make a greater success in the New Year of giving home affairs in the Member States a more European flavour. Let us make a greater success in the New Year of fixing our work in the consciousness of the Member States and of the citizens. On behalf of my group I would like to wish all those with whom I work and my fellow parliamentarians a Happy Christmas! </p>

It is impossible to implement this part relating to subsidies on existing legal bases, especially TACIS, because the resources included in the aid cannot be related to special projects or programmes. The aim is in fact to reduce the country’s debt towards the Community. This proposal is also aimed at confirming the subsidy of EUR 95 million available to Armenia and Georgia in accordance with Council Decision 97/787/EC of 17 November 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission finds it difficult to accept a reduction of the subsidy to EUR 50 million. The reasons for this are as follows. The Community’s financial exposure will continue to be high in an area whose stability has deteriorated, both because of the Russian financial crisis and the current situation in the northern Caucasus. A significant reduction in the EU’s exposure has already been achieved, with the figure concerned going down from EUR 212 million initially, including interest on outstanding debts, to EUR 123 million at present. A further reduction may, however, occur over the next few years if the aid is implemented as planned. </p>
<p class="contents">Armenia and Georgia will have difficulty understanding the fact that the Community is reducing its aid, in spite of the major efforts which these two countries, with support from the IMF and other contributors, have made to reduce their financial liabilities towards the Community. This would put the Community in a difficult situation regarding both these two countries and the international community. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that it would be unfortunate if the Community were to refuse to confirm its financial aid to countries whose strategic importance to the Community is obvious. Moreover, we ought, in the light of the present difficulties in the Caucasus, to send out political signals indicating that we want to continue to support the considerable efforts which are being made to achieve stabilisation and democracy, as well as to introduce reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>In its report A4-0066/99 on the Commission communication on the EU-India Enhanced Partnership, the European Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission to make relations with India one of the EU's foreign policy priorities and 'to propose to the Indian Government the holding of an annual Euro-Indian Summit'. In October of this year the Commission (in the person of Mr Patten, Commissioner) expressed its determination to work towards establishing an EU-India strategic relationship. For a number of reasons - starting with the need to signal a complete break with the climate of relative indifference which has so far characterised EU-India relations and the urgent requirement for account to be taken of the extremely worrying developments taking place within the Chinese communist government and the consequent urgent need for India to be made the focal point of the EU's policy on Asia - the convening of an initial annual EU-India Summit could take on the utmost political significance.</p>
<p>Does the High Representative responsible for the CFSP share this view?</p>
<p>If so, could he indicate what action he has taken (or is intending to take) in order to ensure that the foundations of an EU-India strategic relationship are laid in the very near future?</p>
<p>In particular, is he prepared to do everything possible to enable an initial annual EU-India Summit to take place as early as next year?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council pays enormous attention to the on-going development of relations between the EU and India and actively works to achieve this by remaining in regular high level contact with our Indian partners. The EU is already India’s most important trade partner and its main source of aid in development cooperation. The last round of talks with leading Ministers and officials was held in Helsinki on 2 and 3 December 1999. During that round, many questions of interest and concern to both sides were discussed. These include the issue of cooperation in such areas as human rights, the environment, organised crime and terrorism, illicit drugs trafficking, dialogue on civil society, development trends in investment and trade, international issues such as security, a block on arms, the decommissioning of weapons, regional development in South Asia, and the views for the future that Europe and Asia share for the 21st century.</p>
<p>The next country to hold the Presidency, Portugal, has also made a proposal to hold a Summit meeting between the EU and India during their presidential term, and the General Affairs Council, which was held on 6 December, viewed the proposal positively. India has supported this proposal, and the Commission and the Secretariat are examining options with regard to the Indian Summit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0722"></a>

<p>Police harassment in the USA has increasingly come under the spotlight in recent years. The problem has been confirmed by bodies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. As a result of police excesses, US citizen Ritt Goldstein in 1995 set up a citizens action group in Connecticut to set up external monitoring of the police by independent surveillance bodies. This made Goldstein himself the target of comprehensive police harassment, which forced him to leave the USA and apply for asylum in Sweden in the summer of 1997. His request was rejected in December 1998 as 'clearly without foundation'. The Swedish authorities did not question the severe harassment suffered by Goldstein but referred to the USA as 'an internationally recognised democracy in which the rule of law applied'. They also claimed that Goldstein had not been subject to State persecution as the perpetrators had been individual police officers. At the EU Summit in Tampere, the Council stated that EU refugee policy would be based on 'the full and inclusive application' of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, which should mean that all requests for asylum would be examined individually regardless of the country of origin and regardless whether the applicant had been subject to State or other persecution.</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that requests for asylum from US citizens may be rejected as 'clearly without foundation' without full examination of the individual case? Does it consider that 'unofficial' persecution does not entitle a person to refugee status under the Geneva Convention?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member will certainly know, ideas about what constitutes a ‘safe country of origin’ and applications for asylum that is ‘clearly without foundation’ have not been fully harmonised at Community level. Both phenomena are being discussed in association with the soft law approach in the Council resolution adopted in 1992 on applications for asylum that are clearly without foundation. Member States’ actions are guided in this area, however, by the rules laid down by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 1979 on the procedures and bases for determining refugee status and, in particular, the interpretation of Article 1, section A, paragraph 2 of the 1951 Convention.</p>
<p>This year in March the Commission communicated to the Council and the European Parliament its preparatory act on commonly agreed requirements for asylum-seeking procedures, which set forth ideas on future Community acts on what is meant by ‘clearly without foundation’ and ‘safe country of origin’.

<p>The Council is fully aware of the problem concerning the participation of women in the peace process (or their exclusion from it). In fact “Women and Armed Conflicts” is one of the concerns of the Beijing Action Platform adopted in 1995. Point 135 of the Beijing Action Platform recognises that “in a world of continuing instability and violence, the implementation of cooperative approaches to peace and security is urgently needed. The equal access and full participation of women in power structures and their full involvement in all efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflicts are essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Although women have begun to play an important role in conflict resolution, peace-keeping and defence and foreign affairs mechanisms, they are still underrepresented in decision-making positions. If women are to play an equal part in securing and maintaining peace, they must be empowered politically and economically and represented adequately at all levels of decision making.”</p>
<p>All Members of the United Nations are committed to the following: firstly, to promote equal opportunities and the equal involvement of women so that they are included in all fora and can participate in peace action at all levels and secondly, to take account of considerations of gender equality in the resolution of conflicts, armed or otherwise, and foreign occupation, and ensure that issues of gender equality can be discussed in various bodies.</p>
<p>Ministers who are responsible for equal opportunities raised the subject when they informally convened in Berlin on 14 and 15 June 1999. The Ministers stressed that the UNHCR’s guidelines on the protection of refugee women and the document drafted by the UN’s Interorganisational Standing Committee on mainstreaming gender in the humanitarian response to emergencies, should be applied and implemented forthwith, so that women’s needs might be taken into consideration in crisis situations and so that considerations of gender equality might be taken account of in all humanitarian action concerned with peace and reconstruction.</p>
<p>The Beijing plus five follow-up meeting, to be held next year, will be a good opportunity to evaluate progress and continue the work as appropriate.</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting by the ECE to review the implementation of the Peking action programme in 2000 (Geneva 19 –21 January 2000) will also be an opportunity for the Member States of the EU to be involved at European level in drafting recommendations regarding this issue for the Beijing plus five steering committee to consider. The question of women in military situations and conflicts is one of the subjects to be discussed at the ECE meeting. The Finnish Presidency is at present putting the final touches to the EU’s provisional comments on the final outcome of the meeting. The EU comments emphasise, among other things, the importance of strengthening the status of women as active participants in the prevention of conflicts, peacekeeping and constructive work.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0731"></a>

<p>President, I should like to give a joint answer to the questions by James Fitzsimons, Pat Gallagher and Richard Howitt, all of which refer to the revision of the Treaties.</p>
<p>President, I should first of all like to stress in reply to the questions by James Fitzsimons and Richard Howitt that the Council is fully aware of the importance both of the voluntary services and of certain NGOs in 'civil society'.</p>
<p>In this connection there is a need to stress the importance of voluntary work in the development of social solidarity in the European Union and in meeting those needs which cannot be satisfactorily met by any other means. Because the Treaty of Amsterdam established the importance of voluntary work in our society, the Council has striven by various means to take this special form of solidarity into account and to promote it within Europe, and proposes to give it a great deal of attention in the future as well. In this connection it is worth noting that the increased importance of many NGOs at a social level in Europe is equally essential.</p>
<p>As regards the forthcoming IGC, the Council can only urge the Honourable Members to study the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, paragraph 16 of which deals with the topics for discussion at the Conference which will begin in February 2000. At this stage the agenda for the Conference includes the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, as well as related issues. The conclusions state that the next Presidency may propose additional issues to be included on the agenda of the Conference. According to its terms of reference, the Conference is to examine how the matter raised by the Honourable Member can be taken into account in the work of the Conference.</p>
<p>It may also be noted that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council state that the European Parliament is closely involved and will take part in the work of the Conference. According to paragraph 18 of the conclusions, meetings of the preparatory Group for the Conference may be attended by two observers from the European Parliament. In addition, meetings at ministerial level will be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament; similarly meetings at the level of Heads of State or Government dealing with the IGC will be preceded by an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Council also draws the Honourable Member's attention to the decision taken at the Tampere European Council (15-16 October 1999) that a body specially set up to deal with this matter, comprising representatives of the European Parliament, the Member States' governments, national parliaments and the Commission, be instructed to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union. The first meeting of this body will be held on 17 December and the Members of the European Parliament which is represented on it, will be regularly informed of the progress of negotiations.</p>
<p>In this forum, the European Parliament may bring up the efforts of individual people and organisations working in this area in the civil society to which I have referred.</p>
<p>Regarding the question by Pat Gallagher, the Council assures the Honourable Member that it fully supports the objectives of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and considers it essential to take all possible steps to safeguard children's rights by guaranteeing them appropriate protection against shameful forms of exploitation such as sexual abuse and forced labour, which should no longer occur in our day and age.</p>
<p>The Council also considers that civil society must guarantee without exception to all children the opportunity for education, for today's children are tomorrow's citizens.</p>
<p>I should like to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that the Council does not take part in its capacity as a European Union body in the IGC, which is shortly to be convened to examine ways and means to review the Treaty.</p>
<p>That being so, I feel sure you will understand that the Council cannot reply in more detail to this question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0733"></a>

<p>Taking into account the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes, does the EU Council consider that compensation of EU nationals who fall victim to violent crimes while in another EU Member State should be subject to special measures at EU level, a situation which was not covered in the 1983 Convention and has the Council any time-scale in mind for ensuring the establishment of national programmes for the protection of victims of crime and, finally, will such programmes, which should envisage a special role for NGOs, be considered as an essential element in the enlargement process?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member reminds us in his question, the European Council held on 15 and 16 October 1999 in Tampere considered, on the basis of a communication from the Commission, that ‘minimum standards should be drawn up on the protection of the victims of crime, in particular on victims' access to justice and on their rights to compensation for damages, including legal costs. In addition, national programmes should be set up to finance measures, public and non-governmental, for assistance to and protection of victims’.</p>
<p>The Commission communication referred to in the question was forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may note that in that communication, inter alia, the Member States were called upon to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes concluded on 24 November 1983, which has a more restricted scope.</p>
<p>The purpose of that Convention, which has to date been signed and ratified by eight European Union Member States, is to bind the parties to define in their legislation or administrative provisions a compensation system whereby compensation can be paid from public funds to those victims of violent crimes who have died or received serious physical injuries as a result of acts of violence.</p>
<p>The Commission is following up its communication and will shortly be presenting a table of results of the follow-up to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. On the basis of the Commission communication the Member States are currently looking at the drafting of national programmes to assist and protect the victims of crime. However, the Council notes that it has not itself dealt with the proposals contained in the communication. All areas relating to justice and home affairs, including the status of victims, will be taken into account in the enlargement process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0737"></a>

Furthermore, the technical specifications in Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 on euro coins of 3 May 1998 take account of the fact that these coins must be easily recognisable by means of appropriate visual and tactile features.

<p>The conclusions adopted in the General Affairs Council on 15 November stated that the Council had noted the current situation relating to the discussion of the initiative on the death penalty, as proposed by the EU in the UN General Assembly (motion for a resolution UNGA 54). It once again drew attention to the importance the initiative had as part of the EU’s overall policy on the abolition of the death penalty, and considered it was important to maintain EU unity in the forthcoming talks in New York.</p>
<p>After the EU successfully moved for a resolution on the abolition of the death penalty in the 55<span class="sup">th</span> sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission, it also decided for the first time to move for a draft resolution in the Third Committee of the 54<span class="sup">th</span> General Assembly of the UN. Many countries strongly opposed the initiative, however. The EU and the other countries that supported the initiative had no other choice than to postpone the introduction of the draft resolution on the death penalty, until more favourable circumstances offered themselves. If the initiative were to be discussed now there would be many changes to the text of the draft, as proposed by those counties that are in favour of keeping the death penalty. One of these proposed changes was particularly harmful to the content of the resolution and the whole initiative itself, as it set out to include in the initiative the principle of sovereignty, and the regard for human rights would be subordinate to a ban on interfering in the internal affairs of the country. </p>

<p>Reports coming out of Colombia are giving increasing cause for concern. Since 10 November tens of thousands of rural workers and native Indians have been demonstrating peacefully in Cauca, in the south of the country, and have been calling on the Colombian Government to honour the commitments it entered into with them following an earlier demonstration. The police sent in in response used armed force on 19 November, injuring several demonstrators.</p>
<p>Will the Union be playing a more active role in resolving the various forms of social unrest which have gripped the country for decades?</p>
<p>President Pastrana has asked the European Union to finance the 'Colombia Plan' drawn up by his government. Will the Union see to it that such assistance is not approved until peace agreements have been concluded, thus ensuring that EU funds serve to resolve rather than exacerbate the conflict? How will the European Union ensure that any such assistance is tied to Colombia's acceptance of the recommendations made by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, given that human rights have become a crucial aspect of EU cooperation? Will it ensure that any aid plan for Colombia is tied to specific commitments to make the necessary moves towards greater democracy, clamp down on impunity, disband paramilitary groups and introduce social reform, including agricultural reform, compliance with these commitments being subject to regular checks, conducted with the help of European and Colombian NGOs if possible?</p>

<p>The Council believes, as the Honourable Member does, that the conflict that Columbia has undergone for decades is both difficult and complex. The Union has expressed its satisfaction with the announcement that peace talks would continue between the Colombian Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This announcement is evidence of the clear and courageous commitment of the Colombian Government, whose democratic legitimacy is indubitable, to the peace process. The Union has reconfirmed its attention to support as best it can, and by using appropriate means, attempts at a peace agreement based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It also called on all parties involved in the conflict to work in cooperation, which is vital if lasting peace is to be achieved.</p>
<p>On his visit to the European Parliament on 25 October President Pastrana also met the Secretary-General, CFSP High Representative Javier Solana, who reconfirmed to him the Union’s position on Colombia. Until now, the Union has not received any special request to fund concrete projects under the ‘Colombia Plan’.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Union does not consider it desirable that EU aid should not be granted until peace agreements have been made between the legitimate government and armed groups in Colombia. As with everywhere else in the world, the Union, however, is still anxious that the aid it grants will promote a respect for human rights, which is the key factor in cooperation with third countries.</p>
<p>The Union is still following events in Colombia closely, both at the diplomatic level and through its contact with civil society and the European NGOs whose work is influenced by the situation in Colombia.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would like to state that it is not its task to take a position on the possible role of the European Parliament in this connection, as it is an independent institution, whose competence in the area of foreign policy is precisely defined in the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0752"></a>

<p>The Council supports cross-border cooperation. The importance of this kind of cooperation has grown even more in recent years in relations between the newly independent States, the European Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as there is a common border with the newly independent States now that Finland is in the Union, the Baltic region is becoming ever more important as the Union enlarges, and the western borders of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are developing in their preparations for accession.</p>
<p>The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the Communities, their Member States and the newly independent countries specifies the conditions for gradual convergence within the framework of broader European cooperation.</p>
<p>In the European Union’s joint Russian strategy, which was decided in the European Council in Cologne on 4 June 1999, it was stated that the European Union would support strengthened cross-border and regional cooperation and would draft a plan for appropriate tools within the EC and the Member States to try to enhance the participation of particularly important regions of Russia, as far as the EU is concerned, in EU programmes.</p>
<p>In addition, there is provision in the TACIS programme for support for action to promote cooperation among the Member States, the regions and the border areas. Special attention is to be paid to border crossing arrangements between the newly independent states and the Union, and the newly independent states and Central Europe, as well as measures for the border between Finland and Russia to compare with those brought in in the relevant area between the Union and the PHARE countries. </p>
<p>It can be said, especially with regard to Karelia, that the Finnish areas of North Ostrobothnia, Kainuu, North Karelia and the Karelian Republic within the Russian Federation have decided to establish an area of cooperation, the Karelian EU Border Area. The Finnish regional authorities adopted the memorandum in September 1999, and the Karelian Republic authorities adopted it just recently. A main aim of the Karelian EU Border Area is to make cross-border cooperation more effective by means of a development programme and a common decision-making procedure. The programme is to be implemented with Interreg and TACIS appropriations and national funds. This is the first project on the Russian/Finnish border to embrace non-EU territory. </p>
<p>Furthermore, special attention is being paid to cooperation between the newly independent States and the Union and the newly independent States and Central Europe in terms of large geographical areas.</p>
<p>Cross-border cooperation is being implemented within the framework of the TACIS programme, so as to achieve the greatest possible synergy with that part of the Community programme on interregional cooperation (Interreg) that deals with cross-border cooperation, and the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation. I might remind everyone, in this connection, that the Commission delivered a communication on this subject of cross-border cooperation to the European Parliament, the Council, and the Committee of the Regions, in May 1997. </p>
<p>With regard to cross-border cooperation within the framework of the PHARE programme, I would remind everyone that cooperation involves structural action and from now on not only the border areas between the EU and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but also the border areas between these various countries themselves.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0753"></a>

<p>The Council has noted the decision by the Turkish Appeal Court on 15 November not to carry out the death penalty handed down on 29 June 1999 to Abdullah Öçalan by the State Security Court in Ankara.</p>
<p>The Presidency of the European Union has repeatedly conveyed, and will continue to convey to the Turkish authorities the position the Union has unanimously taken regarding its opposition to the death penalty as a question of principle, irrespective of the defendant or the crime. At the same time, the Council has always clearly expressed its condemnation of all forms of terrorism.</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that it is at the discretion of the Turkish Parliament whether or not the death sentence passed by the Turkish court should be upheld. The Council continues to express its hope that Turkey will continue with the practice it has been adopting over the last 15 years, and not carry out the death sentence. The European Council at Helsinki granted Turkey EU candidate status. On the basis of the Helsinki conclusions, it is very important to point out that the non-application of the death penalty is a part of the common values of the European Union, and thus also a part of Union law. </p>
<p>The Council also understands that the Turkish Government intends to await the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, which asked Turkey on 30 November 1999 to “take all necessary action to ensure that the death sentence is not implemented, so that the court can make effective progress in its examination of the correct conditions and justification for considering the plaintiff’s appeal.”</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0757"></a>

<p>The European Union does not call into question the national sovereign rights of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to its own national airspace. It has on many occasions declared its support for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The EU would like to remind everyone that it is firmly committed to the establishment of a democratic government in all parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within its present borders, and that it notes with satisfaction the democratic reforms that have been made in Montenegro. The Council thus decided to lift the ban in respect of Montenegro and in doing so is showing its support for the ongoing process of reform that the democratically elected government in Montenegro is involved in. In addition, the Council decided to lift the flight ban in respect of the province of Kosovo, for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>The improvement in relations between the EU and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will require decisive action aimed at democracy on the part of that country and total cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia. Decisions on sanctions are to be taken on the basis of developments in the situation as they are achieved in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>With regard to the 1994 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, it has to be said that the EU is not a party to the agreement.

<p>The Commission understands, like the Council, that these are very significant and difficult times for Croatia and for Croatians.</p>
<p>Croatia must adjust to a future without President Tudjman, who, as the leader who steered his country to independence, will always have an important place in Croatian history.</p>
<p>But when this immediate period of mourning is over, Croatia will need to face the future, and decide how best to move forward, to chart a course that will enable it to take its rightful place in the family of European democracies. And she will need all the support of her friends in the Union as she does so.</p>
<p>That is why the Commission hopes – that the forthcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections, when they are held, will mark a turning point for Croatia.</p>
<p>It is vital that those elections should be genuinely free and fair, and seen to be so.</p>
<p>The Commission does not seek to interfere.</p>
<p>All that is asked, as friends of Croatia, is that there should be a level playing field in those elections – not just at the ballot box, but in other crucial areas like access to the media, especially television.</p>
<p>On that basis, the Commission hopes to be able to work closely with the new government. It will look to that government to live up to the standards of accountability and openness that is expected from aspirant members of the European Union. It shall match its cooperation to economic and political reform it carries out. It is hoped that if Croatia lives up to the commitments it has made, it could benefit before long from the Stabilisation and Association process.</p>
<p>In short, there is now an opportunity for a fresh start in relations between Croatia and the European Union. the Commission remains keen to establish and increasingly close relationship.

<p>The Commission has a clear Treaty-based role and institutional responsibilities in the field of external relations, including common foreign and security policy. The Commission is fully associated with the work carried out in the field of CFSP and has an important responsibility for carrying out and executing agreed policy. The Commission recognises that this is a subject in which Honourable Members and others will continue to take a close interest.</p>
<p>But the Commission is pleased that thus far, this team effort is working well, and has every confidence that it will continue to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0775"></a>

<p>It is widely recognised that the SCR has been a failed experiment which has not improved aid management and has reduced further the accountability of the Community's aid programme. Though the immense backlog of payments might have now been significantly reduced, the fact remains that the project cycle is split, and funding processes remain cumbersome and slow. One group of people designs projects, whilst another implements them. There is no common hierarchy or effective coordination mechanism, and there are increased tensions between the geographical desks and the SCR. When does the Commission propose to review the project cycle, and how does it intend effectively to remarry aid policy and design management so that the European Union can boast a coherent and coordinated development aid programme?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for her timely question. It is pleased to announce to the House the creation of a Review Group within the Commission to work on ways of improving the management of the Union's external aid programmes in parallel with the wider reform initiative. Working under the close supervision of Relex Commissioners, the Review Group will aim significantly to improve the quality and timely delivery of projects while maintaining the highest standards of financial control and accountability. Composed of representatives of all the Commission Services involved with managing external assistance, the Review Group will also draw on the experience of other major international donors like the World Bank and the ERBD.</p>
<p>The first question the Review Group will address is the division of responsibilities for managing external aid, in particular within the project cycle. The President of the Commission highlighted the need to look carefully at this complex question when he announced the recent reorganisation of the Commission's services. It is hoped, on the basis of recommendations from the Review Group, Relex Commissioners will be able to take a decision on the way forward next month. It would be premature for me to opt for any particular solution today, before this work has been carried out.</p>
<p>More generally, it is believed the Honourable Member is overly harsh in her judgements about the achievements of the dedicated staff in the "Service Commun Relex" (SCR) since its creation in 1998. The SCR inherited a huge backlog of late payments and unfinished projects. The new division of responsibilities in the Commission services did not address the fundamental problems of severe staff shortages and excessively burdensome legal constraints. While the upheaval of a major restructuring has no doubt had a short-term impact, as it would in any organisation, concrete improvements are starting to be seen.</p>
<p>The backlog of late invoices was cleared during the summer of 1999. Now all valid invoices are paid within the normal 60-day period (provided budgetary resources are available). The rate of project commitments is also up on last year; A manual of harmonised procedures for external aid contracts was approved on 10 November 1999. This will reduce the number of different procedures from over forty to eight, thus considerably simplifying life for external contractors and the Commission administration;</p>
<p>A standard contract for subsidies has recently been agreed. This should also speed up internal procedures, because less time will be spent checking legal paperwork before projects can be approved;</p>
<p>Greater transparency has been achieved thanks to the highly successful SCR web-site, which provides details of tenders and other useful information for contractors. This site attracted a record number of over 275,000 hits in September 1999.</p>
<p>Plainly, there is still much more that can and must be done. Achieving further concrete improvements in the delivery of external assistance is one of the Commission's top priorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has a huge responsibility to the beneficiary countries and to Union taxpayers to maximise the effectiveness of the very considerable resources managed. That is the only way a real difference to economic prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law throughout the world can be made. Rapid and well-targeted delivery of high-quality assistance is a precondition if we are to be an effective player in world affairs. The Review Group announced today should make a significant contribution to achieving this aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0695"></a>

<p>On 5 November 1999, Judge Jackson released his statements of the facts in the case brought by the American Justice Department against Microsoft. This document is still not a final verdict but simply establishes the facts relating to the dominant position held by Microsoft in the PC operating systems market and its practices vis-à-vis some of its competitors.</p>
<p>It is not possible to anticipate a final decision in the American case since we still do not have a final verdict. Nevertheless, it is clear that Microsoft is present throughout the world and that its products are widely distributed within the Community. If the American Justice Department orders remedial action, this will affect the behaviour and commercial policy of Microsoft and will very probably have repercussions for the European markets. The Commission is therefore particularly concerned to observe and monitor the repercussions in Europe of any American judicial decisions.</p>
<p>The Commission and the American competition authorities have been cooperating for several years with regard to competition issues within the framework of the 1991 cooperation agreement. Therefore, the Commission has been kept informed by the American authorities about the proceedings against Microsoft by the American Justice Department concerning Internet navigation software. This case does not, however, prevent the Commission from being able to intervene itself where necessary.</p>
<p>With regard to the actions undertaken by the Commission against Microsoft since the early 90s, it has been active in several cases. These cases include both complaints from third parties and proceedings initiated by the Commission itself. Microsoft has modified its behaviour in several instances in order to comply with European competition rules. In certain cases, Microsoft has itself settled its dispute with the complainant in order to avoid possible action against it by the Commission.</p>
<p>Of course, the Commission is very concerned to prevent any anti-competitive practices in Europe. To this end the Commission is continuing with other cases involving Microsoft, in particular two complaints made against it by some of its competitors and which concern areas not covered by the current proceedings in the United States. In this respect, the Commission wishes to point out that the proceedings, such as those being brought by the American justice system, should establish, on the one hand, Microsoft’s dominant position, but also, on the other hand, the abuse of that dominant position, in accordance with the provisions of Article 82 (ex-Article 86) of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0717"></a>

<p>The Commission applies the same approach to all commercial organisations which are in dominant positions, without regard to the legal status under which they are incorporated. The Commission has already indicated that in its reply to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-4-1998-0836_EN.html">E-0836/98</a> and, subsequently, in its reply to oral question H 515/98 given on 16 June 1998. The competition concerns regarding certain Finnish local telephone cooperatives do not relate to their legal status but to the fact that the rebates granted by these cooperatives could constitute abuses of dominant positions under EC competition law. As already mentioned in the above replies, rebates combined with personal shares in cooperatives which aim or have as effect to bind the customer to use only this cooperative can – in line with the case law of the Court of Justice – be considered as an abuse of a dominant position, especially when leading to price discrimination. Such rebates obviously discourage these subscribers to switch to competitors who cannot use rebates basing on the return on investments made in the past when sheltered by monopoly rights, as the relevant cooperatives.</p>
<p>Already in 1997 – in the framework of the preparation of the third report on the implementation of the Community Telecommunications Directives – the Commission raised the possible incompatibility with the Treaty competition rules of such rebates by local telecommunications operators, and in particular by the Helsinki Telephone Company.</p>
<p>The initiatives taken by the company are suitable to remedy the concerns mentioned. The Commission decided therefore to close the administrative procedure opened regarding this possible infringement to the Treaty rules.</p>
<p>It should in this regard be emphasised that Community competition rules only prohibit abuses of a dominant position on a substantial part of the common market. The Commission therefore does not intend to investigate the rebate practices of smaller local telephony operators which do not have a dominant position on a substantial part of the common market. This matter must be assessed under national competition law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0769"></a>

<p>The Commission cannot accept to extend the validity of the current regional aid map for the United Kingdom until 31 March 2000 in case that the new map has not been approved before 31 December 1999.</p>
<p>By letter dated 24 February 1998, the Commission proposed on the basis of Article 88(1) (ex-Article 93) of the EC Treaty to the Member States to limit the duration of the existing regional aid maps to the 31 December 1999. This was accepted by the United Kingdom and by all the other Member States. The Commission further asked Member States in the same letter to submit their proposal for a new regional aid map by 31 March 1999. This delay was set in order to allow for the timely approval of regional aid maps before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Member States have been reminded several times of the need for timely notifications and of the requirements established by state aid rules to be respected by the new regional aid maps.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom notified its proposal for the future map by letter dated 15 July 1999. Replies to the Commission's requests for additional information were sent last time in October 1999. Additional information was also provided at several meetings with the British authorities, of which the last was held on 25 November.</p>
<p>The Commission regrets that due to the delayed notification and to the incompleteness of the notification, it will not be in a position to approve the United Kingdom map by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently assessing additional information on several crucial points which it has received on 3 December 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission reminded Member States at several occasions of the important consequences of such a situation, last time by letter dated 26 October 1999. Member States for which no new regional aid map will have been approved before 1.1.2000, will not be able to grant any regional aid from 1.1.2000 until the date on which a new map is approved by the Commission.

<p>In March 1998, the European Investment Bank granted a loan of about ITL 60 billion to Gardaland S.p.A., for the purpose of enlarging the leisure park of the same name. The author of this question harbours doubts about the advisability of granting the loan to a company which has substantial assets and is located in a region which is flourishing economically and which is particularly valuable and very important in ecological terms. When it was asked about the nature of the investment planned by Gardaland, the Bank argued that it was unable to forward the relevant documents on the grounds of the confidential nature of relations between the Bank and its customers.</p>
<p>In view of the links between the ECOFIN Council and the EIB Board of Governors, could the Commission state whether it intends to take measures to make information relating to decisions by the EIB more transparent and accessible, particularly where such decisions have major repercussions on a region's development?

<p>The Commission refers to the answers given to previous Parliamentary written Questions (1522/99 and 2513/98) on the EIB's financing for the upgrading of Gardaland's facilities. In these answers, the reasons for advancing a loan as well as the expected benefits for the region's economy have been duly set out.</p>
<p>As regards transparency, the EIB is committed to an active public information policy, aimed at improving knowledge and understanding of its mission and activity in support of Community objectives. In March 1997, the Bank adopted the guidelines for its information policy and the rules on public access to documents, which were published in the Official Journal No. C 423/13 on 9/8/1997.</p>
<p>While extending and diversifying its information sources, the EIB takes into consideration its obligations as a bank to respect confidentiality and the legitimate interests of its owners, borrowers, lenders and other third parties. Therefore, documents which originate from outside the Bank cannot be disclosed by the EIB. The applicant may, however, be referred to the origin of the document or to any other source where the document may be available.</p>
<p>As regards financial accounting and procedures which take environmental costs into account, the EIB aims to achieve best environmental practice in so far as its role and responsibilities permit it. It must be stressed, however, that the promoter, Gardaland in this case, is responsible for compliance with the legal obligations and standards relating to the environment. Regulation and enforcement is performed by the competent authorities at Community and/or national level.</p>
<p>In all sectors, environmental investigations form an integral part of the work carried out by the Bank to assess whether a project qualifies for financing. On this basis, the Bank seeks indeed, as far as practicable, to internalise environmental costs and benefits in the economic valuation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to point out that the EIB is an independent institution whose management operates under the authority and the guidelines given to it by the Member States as shareholders of the Bank.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0675"></a>

Reference is made in particular to part of Amendment No 33 which exempted certain temporary copies from the reproduction right only in so far as they related to authorised use.</p>
<p>The Commission shares Parliament’s concern to ensure meaningful harmonisation of copyright, which promotes innovation, investment and creativity Community-wide taking due account of all rights and interests involved. This has also been highlighted by the previous Commission on 9 February in the context of the first reading of the proposal. In this session, as well as subsequently in the amended proposal, the Commission explained in some detail why it could not accept all amendments, or at least not all elements.</p>
<p>This was in particular the case as regards the introduction in Article 5(1) of the condition that the main act of use of a work should be authorised by the rightsholders or permitted by law. The Commission shares the Parliament's concern to ensure that networks do not serve as vectors for the transmission of pirated content. However, it feels that adding this condition would not be the most appropriate or commensurate means of achieving that objective and, on the contrary, might jeopardise the proper functioning of the networks. It therefore opted to strengthen the conditions applicable to this exception by accepting other parts of the amendment of parliament on this provision. Together with Article 8, on sanctions and remedies, Article 5 as it stands ensures a satisfactory balance between the rights of rightsholders and the legitimate interests of other groups involved (telecommunication operators, users, consumers, and others).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0725"></a>

<p>Council Directive 91/639/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs provides for the Commission to present a report on different aspects concerning the keeping of pigs in intensive rearing systems with particular regard to the welfare of sows reared in varying degrees of confinement and in groups.</p>
<p>The Commission asked the Scientific Committee on animal health and welfare to contribute to the abovementioned report elaborating an opinion on the welfare of pigs farmed in intensive conditions.</p>
<p>After the adoption of the opinion by the Scientific Committee, the Commission started to work on appropriate proposals to amend Directive 91/639/EEC in line with new scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The elaboration of a proposal in this field includes the consultation with different experts from Member States, from professional organisations and from the main animal welfare associations.</p>
<p>The Commission is also requesting from Member States information on the inspections carried out in pig farms on their territory following the provisions of Directive 91/639/EC. These data will have to be taken into account for the elaboration of the new proposal.</p>
<p>The draft Commission proposal will address in particular provisions for the keeping of sows in groups and establish separate areas for their normal behaviour patterns. The Commission proposal will then be submitted to the Council and Parliament for approval during the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>The Commission will propose to apply the up-to-date provisions on newly built farms. The application of the new requirements in existing systems is a matter of discussion between experts taking into consideration in particular the social-economic implications.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0701"></a>

<p>The reports of unlawful remuneration payments by the Commission representation in Stockholm have shocked many Swedes and aroused their distrust of the EU. People are asking how the Commission can be expected to manage its other payments if it cannot even do so in a small office with a staff of no more than 20 people. This bad impression is further strengthened by the unavailability of senior staff for comment and the fact that the person in charge at the time is suddenly on holiday. The absence of any sense of responsibility was the main criticism in the report by the Committee of Independent Experts which led to the resignation of the previous Commission. The President of the Court of Auditors has pointed out that, when irregularities are revealed, senior Commission staff all too often claim that they did not know what was going on. Many will regard the Commission's handling of this matter in Stockholm as a test of the new openness and sense of responsibility it promised. This is a matter of principle, regardless of the small sums that may have been involved. It is also important for Swedish confidence in the EU that the Swedish police be given access to all the material it needs for its investigation. </p>
<p>How is the Commission going to bring about an immediate change regarding the assumption of responsibility so that the public is not again to be forced to associate the Commission with a combination of irregularities and senior staff who shirk their responsibilities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the concerns which the allegations of irregularities in the Stockholm representation have given rise to amongst European citizens, and in particular amongst Swedish citizens. It is, however, important to point out that the Commission has reacted to the allegations with due diligence.</p>
<p>In this respect, the services responsible immediately started a preliminary enquiry procedure, and the matter was referred to OLAF. The latter is carrying out all the necessary investigations at this very moment. The Commission would like to point out the strict confidentiality of these investigations, so as not to prejudice the results of the enquiry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the members of staff who may have been directly responsible for any irregularities have been provisionally relieved of their duties and are on leave. The departure on holiday of the head of the representation at the time – which the Honourable Member refers to – simply shows the concern of the interested party and the Commission not to hinder the investigation, and reflects a strict respect for the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>If OLAF confirms the alleged irregularities, it will fall to the Commission to take the appropriate action against those responsible, in accordance with the statute.</p>
<p>The Commission also draws the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that it is the responsibility of the President of the Court of Auditors alone to take responsibility for his words with regard to the attitude of the Commission officials in this matter.</p>
<p>With regard to the cooperation with the Swedish police which the Honourable Member wishes to see, the appropriate contacts have been made by OLAF, in accordance with the legislation and procedures in force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to respond more closely to the question of reform in the area of responsibilities raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out the proposals which were included at this stage in its communication of 15 November 1999, entitled “Suggestions for a reform strategy” (doc. SEC(1999) 1917/2), and which will be developed and expanded on in a communication in February 2000 on the reform strategy.</p>
<p>Without anticipating the specific details which will be defined after a broad consultation – which Parliament is very keen to see – with a number of bodies, including the European Parliament, the Commission considers that strengthening of responsibility should involve three main channels: action with regard to personnel, both through an improvement in recruitment and through the development of training; action with regard to disciplinary procedures, which will have to be more efficient; and finally, action with regard to the financial mechanisms, through the establishment of a system based on the internal control of services and the creation of an internal auditing department.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0714"></a>

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that consumer confidence in food safety has deteriorated over recent years, linked with issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and dioxin. The Commission therefore stated several times that food safety is a major issue, not only in international trade but also for internal production. It is for this reason that the Commission is working actively on the white paper on food safety which the Member of the Commission in charge of health and consumer protection is preparing and which is due to be adopted in the Commission on 22 December. This paper will deal with the aspects of food safety from the “stable to the table”, and in particular on domestic production, imported food and the establishment of a food agency.</p>
<p>As concerns the World trade organisation and food safety, there appears to be a fear that WTO rules threaten the ability of members to ensure a high level of protection in this area. However, the SPS agreement, as interpreted by the Appellate Body in the hormones case, is very clear: each WTO member can set its level of protection as high as it wishes – even at zero risk, if it so chooses – and can take the measures necessary to achieve that level of protection. For this reason the Commission saw no need to ask for a re-negotiation of that SPS<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Agreement in the new round.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those who mistrust the WTO in respect of health concerns often point to the hormones case as proof that the WTO can be used to oblige the Community to import hormone treated beef, even when these products present a health risk. The WTO panel found that the Community hormone ban was not based on a proper risk assessment. However, the Community now has independent scientific advice suggesting a risk associated with beef produced with hormones. Consequently, the Community has maintained the ban and has launched a new set of studies aiming to provide more scientific evidence.</p>
<p>However, with regard to food safety the Commission had the intention to clarify and strengthen the existing WTO framework for the use of the precautionary principle, in particular with a view to finding an agreed methodology for the scope of action under that principle and guidelines for its implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding labelling, the rules are not clear in the WTO. While in no way intending to use labelling as a weapon to force other countries to accept the Community values without question, the Commission nevertheless had indicated its intention to seek clarity on the scope of labelling possibilities within WTO rules. In this respect the Commission wished to clarify the relationship between WTO rules and non-product related process and production methods, with regard, in particular, to eco-labelling, and in the context of the TBT<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> discussion, where the Commission intended to seek to agree multilateral guidelines on labelling in general.</p>
<p>Now that Seattle has failed to deliver a mandate for a comprehensive negotiating round, the Commission will have to examine how to pursue its objectives regarding food safety and labelling in the post-Seattle context.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s view that these practices should be condemned. They constitute a violation of the human dignity of children and of the fundamental principles of sporting ethics. Sport should play an educational role and contribute to social integration. These practices are the antithesis of the values which sport is supposed to defend.</p>
<p>The Commission has prepared, with the European Council in Helsinki in mind, a report on the evolution of sport in Europe, in which it states that the excessive commercialisation of sporting activities may lead to unacceptable practices. The Commission also stresses the need to protect the health of sportspeople, in particular the younger ones. Furthermore it confirms its commitment to the protection and education of young sportspeople.</p>
<p>However, while sharing the Honourable Member’s approach, the Commission considers that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, this action comes rather within the competence of national authorities, since it directly concerns the working conditions of foreign minors. Therefore, it falls to the Member States to act in the first place.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission points out that Council Directive 94/33/EC, on the protection of young people at work, obliges Member States to take the necessary measures to prohibit child labour. However, it allows Member States to authorise, according to certain conditions and procedures, the employment of children for activities of a cultural, artistic, sporting and advertising nature. The provisions of that directive are applied insofar as the young people in question have a working relationship regulated by the law in force in the Member State. It falls firstly to the authorities in the Member States concerned to examine and assess the situations indicated with regard to their obligations stemming from the provisions of the Community directive incorporated into national legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0716"></a>

<p>The absence of harmonised rules in Europe on articles of precious metals is due to the existence of different systems of marking in the Member States.</p>
<p>Some Member States traditionally follow the system of pre-marketing control under which the marking is struck by an independent body verifying the products generally called “hallmarking”. Other Member States follow the system of post-marking control of the marking that has been stamped on the articles by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice in its Judgment “Houtwipper” ruled that Member States are obliged to recognise equivalent hallmarkings of other Member States and not require an additional national hallmark to be struck on imported articles of precious metals.</p>
<p>As a result of the Court’s judgment and the Commission’s actions, the national hallmarking regulations of the Member States provide for the mutual recognition of equivalent hallmarks.</p>
<p>The monitoring by the Commission of the application of national rules on hallmarking revealed that no major problems exist in intra-Community trade of articles of precious metals.</p>
<p>This is proven by the increasing volume of trade between Member States applying different hallmarking systems. Nevertheless, some minor disparities of the hallmarking systems between Member States continue to exist and are the subject of a few complaints submitted by economic operators and are currently treated by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, the differences between a hallmarking system and a post-market control approach justify barriers to trade. Therefore, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a harmonisation directive aiming at approximating the different systems of marking in order to eliminate these barriers.

The consultation was intended to allow the a priori participation of all interested or affected actors in the preparation of recommendations concerning the appropriate measures to be taken at the Community level to promote ICZM.</p>
<p>The results of the programme and consultation are now being condensed into a Commission Communication which will propose a European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. This Communication is still in the drafting phase, but it is intended to outline a coherent series of measures to ensure that the Community plays an appropriate role in ensuring the sustainable management of coastal zones, in partnership with actors at the national, regional and local level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Commission is aware, Ireland has an extensive coastline. On 19 November last, a British registered vessel, Posidonia, was intercepted off the west coast of Cork following a tip-off and IEP 15 million worth of cannabis was seized in a combined operation by Irish naval, customs and police forces. The drugs were destined for export to continental Europe. Despite successes in seizing illegal drugs, it is estimated that a drug trafficker's chance of landing undetected shipments in Ireland is 20 times greater than on other European coastlines.</p>
<p>Given that drug smuggling has no borders and is operated on a European and world-wide basis and that the EU is bound by the Treaty to fight illicit drug trafficking and, furthermore, taking into account the recent conclusions of the Tampere Council and the commitment to addressing the drugs problem in a comprehensive manner, will the Commission, as part of such a commitment, indicate what resources it could make available to the Irish authorities to set up and maintain a US-style coastguard which could be deployed to intercept and deter drug smugglers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member points out, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit did refer to the fight against illicit drug trafficking as being a priority area for police cooperation within the Union.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the European Council called for joint teams to be set up to conduct inquiries in particular into how networks of drug traffickers could be destroyed, and it also called for representatives of Europol to be involved in such inquiries.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware that the configuration of the Irish coastline is such that it is easier for traffickers to land large quantities of drugs in Ireland than elsewhere and that it is very difficult to keep the entire Irish coastline under surveillance. However, countries other than Ireland also have similar geographical features.</p>
<p>The Commission is not planning to propose that specific resources be allocated to fund an increase in the numbers employed in the Irish Coastguard Service; since it takes the view that that is a matter for the Member States. Union Programmes – OISIN and Customs 2000 – have, however, been implemented in order to support cooperation between services combating illicit trafficking. Accordingly, they are contributing towards an improvement in the effectiveness of the campaigns carried out by the national services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0736"></a>

<p>The programme for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation was delayed for a number of reasons, among which were the following:</p>
<p>The tender relating to supply of 40 000 tonnes of pork meat was suspended from 8 June 1999 until 19 August 1999 as a result of the dioxin problem in Belgium. When re-opened, due to an absence of offers for certain lots, only 36 500 tonnes were purchased, bringing the total pork purchased to 58 500 tonnes. The mobilisation of pork meat, requiring a two phase tendering process (purchase tender followed by transport) is particularly lengthy compared to the mobilisation of intervention goods.</p>
<p>Agreement was not reached until mid-July on net pork prices to be used in estimating internal sales prices in Russia, these estimates to be used as a basis for advance payments by the Russian authorities into a special account.</p>
<p>Revised list of destinations presented by Russian authorities required Commission approval which did not take place until 28 July 1999.</p>
<p>Delivery of beef meat under the third tranche was suspended during a period of two weeks due to an insufficiency of storage space at the destinations designated by the Russian authorities.</p>
<p>On several occasions, the Commission considered the prices offered to be too high and therefore passed to the second tendering date which resulted in a delay of two weeks on each occasion.</p>
<p>Completion of the programme as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding would call for the further mobilisation of approximately 41 500 tonnes of pork, 10 000 tonnes of beef and 5 000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder. If a political decision is taken to do so, it will require a non-automatic carry forward of credits from the 1999 financial year to the year 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0740"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the difficulties, which have been experienced by sheep farmers in Ireland and other Member States over recent months. Although in 1999, a return to a more normal seasonal marketing pattern has been seen, this has given rise to an oversupply of lambs on the market. In order to alleviate the situation, the Commission adopted a measure introducing aid for private storage at the beginning of October, as well as the second advance on the ewe premium which was payable from the middle of October. There are no indications of a recovery in prices. Since the end of October, prices in Ireland have risen by almost 14%.</p>
<p>It is clear that the long-term viability of the sector must depend on the improvement of quality in order to respond to the needs of consumers.

<p>The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendation concerning the limitation of capacity of fleets fishing for northern albacore will be implemented through a proposal for a regulation on technical measures applicable to fisheries for highly migratory fish. In order to have a more coherent Community policy, the commission proposes to integrate the measures adopted by the different tuna management organisations of which the Community is a contracting party into one single specific regulation. This proposal is currently at the final stages of preparation by the Commission, and will be submitted to the Council at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that an effective control of fishing activities is of the utmost importance for the proper implementation of conservation measures applicable to albacore, as well as other stocks. To this end, each Member State is responsible for the deployment of sufficient means of inspection and surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission will use its power as under Article 29 under Regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93, in order to verify on the spot the implementation of control and conservation measures by the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards any measures for the management of the northern albacore fishery on the initiative of the Community, ICCAT referred the matter to its SCRS (Standing Committee for Research and Statistics) with a view to evaluating the strength of current fishing and proposing any appropriate measures, should current measures be deemed unsatisfactory. As far as the Community is concerned, it is up to the Member States to provide the best data available. </p>
<p>As regards the relationship between ICCAT and the phasing out of driftnets, it is to be noted that these obligations are of a different nature; the ICCAT recommendation concerns all fishing gear participating in the northern albacore fishery, not only driftnets.

<p>After the failure of the joint committee of the French Senate and National Assembly of 18 November 1999, the Commission gave France notice to present its observations within 15 days, on 24 November 1999, in accordance with Article 226 (ex-Article 169) of the EC Treaty. The Commission then reserves the right to issue a reasoned opinion. On 2 December, Mr Pierret, French Secretary of State for Energy, informed the Council on Energy that the French Government had laid down provisions with a view to adopting the law in February 2000.</p>
<p>On the initiative of Électricité de France and in agreement with the French Government, industrial consumers of more than 100 Gwh (that is, 22% of the market) benefit from access to the network on the basis of public tariffs, for the transmission of electricity which may be bought from suppliers from other Member States.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of ABB ALSTOM POWER, a company created by a merger on 30 June 1999, has announced plans to restructure its activities. Job losses have already been announced in some countries where the company operates. However, that scant initial information does not seem to be the last we shall hear about it. The situation, which is particularly harmful in terms of employment, raises a number of questions, with particular regard to the truthful nature of the information given to the European Works Council created in May 1996. There is, accordingly, a more urgent need to review and update the European Works Council Directive. Lessons must be learned from these events. Should not the Directive be amended and have incorporated in it the requirement of a six-month suspensory time-limit applicable to any restructuring plans so that an independent trade union report may be drawn up? What is the Commission's opinion?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has always underlined that whilst decisions on corporate restructuring must be left to companies, everything should be done to adopt a positive approach encompassing notably:</p>
<p>-	the search for solutions which avoid serious social consequences like massive dismissals</p>
<p>-	that these operations must be done in an acceptable manner in particular following proper and effective worker information and consultation.</p>
<p>According to the information available, the announced restructuring within ABB Alstom Power does not, at this stage, raise particular concerns as regards compliance with existing Community and national rules in the field of workers involvement, notably with regard to the Collective Redundancies Directive and the European Works Councils Directive.</p>
<p>However, this announcement by ABB Alstom Power highlights again the weakness of the Community and national legal framework in this field. The Commission's "Proposal for a Council Directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community" (November 1998) aims to eliminate this weakness.</p>
<p>With regard to the Directive on European Works Councils, the Commission is currently assessing the operation of the Directive in consultation with Member States and social partners at European level. After this review process, and taking account of the progress achieved concerning the proposed framework Directive on information and consultation, the Commission will take the appropriate decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0751"></a>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member refers to a call for proposals aimed at improving the financial environment of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) (98 C 263 of 20 August, 1998), with deadlines of 30 September 1998 and 30 September 1999, to be financed under the Multiannual Programme in favour of SMEs (1997-2000).</p>
<p>The Commission intends to develop financial engineering instruments in two fields: networks connecting informal investors (so-called Business Angels) and business creators on the one hand, and mutual guarantee schemes in order to facilitate access to loans on the other.</p>
<p>There was considerable interest in the call for proposals. In order to speed up support for the Business Angel networks, it was decided that the best proposals introduced in September 1998 should be financed under the 1998 and 1999 budget (without waiting for the deadline of autumn 1999), leaving the proposals submitted by 30th September 1999 for commitment under the 2000 budget.</p>
<p>During the last 12 months, the issue of Business Angels has attracted an increasing amount of attention due to the recognition of the important role that Business Angels Networks play in providing equity finance for new, young businesses. Thus a very large number of proposals were submitted by the 30 September 1999 deadline: 61 proposals for Business Angels networks and 13 proposals for Mutual Guarantee societies, exceeding the forecast available budget for 2000 by more than 8 times. This means that the selection committee will have to make a very thorough assessment.</p>
<p>The work programme of Directorate-General for Enterprise under the Multiannual Programme for SMEs for 2000 was approved by the management committee of the Member States on 3 December 1999, so that participants in the call will be informed of the outcome of the selection process early next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0758"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the epidemic of catarrhal fever which throughout this year has spread along the coasts of the Aegean Sea.</p>

<p>The Commission has paid particular attention to this worrying situation and safeguard measures have been adopted as the epidemic has developed.</p>
<p>The Commission has furthermore contributed to the cost of the disease-combating measures implemented by the Greek authorities within the framework of the provisions laid down for the payment of veterinary expenses incurred through emergency interventions.</p>
<p>It will allow for legitimate compensation for the damage to breeders through the slaughter of sick animals in herds affected by the epidemic.</p>
<p>However it should be pointed out that the measures undertaken have not checked the progress of the disease.</p>
<p>The epidemic has taken on a new aspect and today there is an unprecedented situation.</p>
<p>This situation should be considered within the context of the changes in the global climate which have been recorded in recent years and which have a direct effect on diseases transmitted by insects.</p>

<p>The Commission recommended vaccination after a veterinary mission in Greece in August 1999, but the Greek authorities are not in favour of this option.</p>

Thus a call for tenders has to be published in the official journal. Time limits for the submission of tenders have to be respected, and specific award procedures have to be followed. Any exception to the application of these rules has to be also in conformity with the exceptions expressly provided for by the directives.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that one of the conditions for the financing of specific projects under the second Community support framework is the compliance with Community Public Procurement rules.</p>
<p>The Commission would finally observe that the submission of the contracts to the Greek Court of Auditors for approval constitutes a national law requirement which is not imposed by the public procurement directives and that therefore remains within the field of competence of the Greek authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0766"></a>

<p>On several occasions during the autumn, the Commission has stressed the importance of more open and transparent communication within the Commission, between the various institutions and with the public. I believe this to be important as freedom of expression is of fundamental significance for a free society. At the same time, I was disturbed by the Commission's handling of the van Buitenen affair after he published his book last autumn. I became even more alarmed when I watched an interview with Mr Kinnock on Swedish television on 28 October in which it became evident that the Swedish approach to public access and openness can hardly be applied in an international organisation such as the EU.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing, will the Commission say how it intends to apply the principle of public access to information within the Commission and whether it intends to impose constraints on this form of freedom of expression?</p>
<p>What does the Commission intend to do in practice to break this culture of secrecy and ensure that the EU institutions, particularly the Commission, become more open and transparent?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member rightly points out, the Commission attaches the utmost importance to the transparency of its work. In fact, it considers that transparency ensures the greatest possible participation of the citizens in the decision-making process, and guarantees the greatest legitimacy, efficiency and responsibility of the administration with regard to the citizens. In this context, one of the key measures adopted by the Commission concerns public access to its documents. This is why in February 1994 the Commission adopted a common code of conduct with the Council on access to their documents. This code establishes the principle that the public should have the greatest possible access to the internal documents of the institutions, with the exception concerning the preservation of public and private interests and the confidentiality of their deliberations.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 255 of the EC Treaty, it falls to the Commission to present a legislative proposal on the general principles and limitations governing the exercise of citizens’ right to access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This new legislation, which will be common to all three Institutions, will replace the previous rules and will aim to optimise access to documents with the greatest possible respect for openness. The Commission has already carried out significant preparatory work with a view to presenting this legislative proposal to Parliament, envisaged for the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>The right of citizens of the Union of access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents enshrined in Article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty implies at the same time that officials can provide information which falls within the public domain. The limitations to the general principle of access based on recognised public or private interests which must be protected, are the embodiment of the obligation of discretion laid down in the Staff Regulations for Community officials.</p>
<p>As regards the freedom of expression the Staff Regulations effectively impose on the official a duty of loyalty to his employer and contain restrictions on disclosure insofar as the official must act with discretion with regard to information he receives in the exercise of his duties and which is not in the public domain. This does not constitute an obligation of absolute secrecy but a justified restriction in cases where non-disclosure is essential for the functioning of the Institutions or the safeguard of rights of third persons for example.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is an obligation for all staff to ask for prior authorisation for publications, but the authorisation can only be refused if the publication is liable to prejudice the interests of the Communities.</p>
<p>All these restrictions are subject to control by the Tribunal and the Court of Justice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0776"></a>

<p>The answer to my previous question to the Commission concerning brominated fire-retardants gave rise to several more questions.</p>
<p>In reply to my question as to whether the Commission intended to press for an EU ban on brominated fire-retardants, the Commission answered that a proposal for a ban had been withdrawn in 1995. In reply to my question as to whether a unilateral Swedish ban would constitute a threat to the free movement of goods and therefore be contrary to EU legislation, I was referred to Articles 28 and 30 of the Treaty. An interpretation on the basis of Article 95(5) and subsequent paragraphs would suggest that Sweden may introduce a ban only if the problem is specific to Sweden. Brominated fire-retardants are equally dangerous for all.</p>
<p>On what grounds was the proposal for a ban withdrawn?</p>
<p>How are the references to Articles 28 and 30 to be interpreted in this context?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the reasons why in 1995 the Commission withdrew its proposal dating from 1991 banning the marketing of all diphenyl polybromide oxides, it should be mentioned that Parliament at the time had not issued an opinion at first reading, which prevented the codecision procedure from being completed. However, the Commission embarked upon, and is in the process of completing, an evaluation of the risks associated with three of these substances and their use, within the framework of Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93. The results of this evaluation will allow the Commission, where necessary, to propose appropriate measures for the reduction of these risks. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that, since the mid 1990s, the brominated fire-retardants industry has implemented, within the framework of the OECD, a voluntary agreement with a view to improving their control of these products.</p>
<p>The honourable member of the Parliament mentioned the applicability of Article 95(5) of the EC Treaty. To respond to this, the following clarification should be made. Only in such areas where harmonisation has already been adopted, according to the procedure set out in Article 95(1), EC Treaty, is it possible to invoke Article 95(5) of the same Treaty. Harmonisation measures to ban brominated flame retardants have not been adopted.</p>
<p>This leads back to the possible application of Articles 28-30 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>As the Commission mentioned in its reply to the written question 1976/99, a total ban adopted by one Member State could be contrary to Articles 28-30 of the Treaty, as it may impede the free movement of the goods in question; not only brominated flame retardants as such, but also computers and other electrical equipment, which are produced with such flame retardants to reduce the risk of fire.</p>
<p>However, a ban can be justified if it is indistinctly applicable to domestic products, necessary and proportionate. The justification must also be assessed according to the principles of precaution and prevention, the principle of rectifying environmental damage at source, and the "polluter pays" principle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0777"></a>

<p>The Commission deeply regrets the heavy losses suffered by the Scottish salmon farming industry due to the presence of Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA). This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of a fragile market situation for salmon.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the consequences of the disease and of the disease control policy for the sector. Possibilities exist under Community legislation for Member States to grant a national financial aid in case of disease outbreaks in the new aquaculture sector. For that purpose, the authorities of the Member State concerned shall notify the draft measures to the Commission. According to the guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture, measures aimed at compensating losses suffered by the producers may be deemed compatible with the common market provided that an eradication plan is decided by the competent authorities. So far the Commission has not received any formal request for Community aid from the British authorities in this case. Community financial compensation does not exist at present. However, Council Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field<a href="#defann_77_1" name="refann_77_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> lists, in its Article 3, the animal diseases for which an emergency financial compensation by the Community may be granted. This financial contribution must be 50% of the costs incurred by the Member State in compensating owners for the slaughter and destruction of animals and for other disease control measures; where vaccination has been decided upon, this must be 100% of the costs of supply of vaccine and 50% of the costs incurred for carrying out the vaccination. ISA is however not included in the list of diseases eligible for compensation. Its inclusion requires a Decision by the Commission in accordance with the procedure of the Standing Veterinary Committee.</p>
<p>Further to Article 3, Council Decision 90/424/EEC introduces in its Article 24 the possibility for a Community financial measure for the eradication and monitoring of certain diseases. This compensation is based on the approval of annual programmes to be submitted by the Member States. These programmes shall supply all the appropriate financial information and shall indicate in particular the total estimated cost of carrying out the programme. The level of Community financial contribution in this case shall be fixed at 50% of the costs incurred by the Member States by way of compensation for owners for the slaughter of the animals. ISA is however not included in the list of diseases to which Article 24 applies. Its inclusion requires a Council Decision upon a formal proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission will examine whether it is appropriate to take action for the inclusion of ISA in one of the lists referred to in Decision 90/424/EEC. Before taking such a decision, the Commission wants to make a complete assessment of the situation in order to have a clear idea about the impact of a decision on financial compensation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
