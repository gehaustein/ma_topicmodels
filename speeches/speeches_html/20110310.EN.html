<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johannes Hahn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to thank honourable Members for this opportunity to dispel some widely held misunderstandings regarding the Irish programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The S&amp;D Group’s question that gave rise to this statement raises honourable Members’ concern that certain economic policy conditions set out in the Memorandum of Understanding of the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland are in legal conflict with Article 153(5) of the Treaty. That paragraph excludes the adoption of provisions in the field of pay under Article 153, that is, in the field of social policy. However, the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland is not a social policy programme and is not adopted under Article 153. It is a financial assistance programme set up, together with the Irish Government, to restore domestic and external confidence and remove the harmful feedback loops between the fiscal and financial crisis. Therefore, it is grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty, which allows for Union financial assistance if a Member State is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the MOU is to specify the economic policy conditions that serve as a benchmark for assessing the Irish policy performance during the financial assistance programme. The Member State has full ownership of these economic policy conditions and their implementation. These conditions are commitments of the Member State that are undertaken by the state itself. It is not EU action in the respective fields. Indeed, many of the conditions, such as the minimum wage reduction, were already included in the Irish Government’s national recovery plan that was published on 24 November 2010, before the start of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the conditions relating to labour market policy is to create jobs and to avoid long-term unemployment in Ireland amongst the most vulnerable groups. The minimum wage reduction is part of this wider package of measures and needs to be seen together with activation policies and efforts to modernise the benefit system. When evaluating the reduction in one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union – it is, for instance, the second highest in the eurozone – and although there was significant wage adjustment in the economy, with the minimum wage, in common with wages in general in Ireland, falling by 3% in real terms in 2008, followed by a rise of 0.3% in 2009, it should be noted that most of the labour market adjustments took the form of job losses. In fact, the minimum wage cut only restored the status quo prevailing before 1 January 2007, i.e. before the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The other condition mentioned in the question is an independent review of sectoral collective bargaining. The motivation of the review is to discuss the fairness and efficiency of employment conditions for both employees and employers across sectors. I would like to highlight the fact that Ireland has a long-standing tradition of tripartite consultation on economic and social policy and that the successive pacts between the government and the social partners since the 1980s have been widely recognised as major factors in the success of the Irish economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The review is an opportunity for the social partners to voice opinions and shape policy, and its announcement was welcomed as such. I am fully confident that the review will be carried out by the Irish Government in a way that recognises the importance of social dialogue, includes all the social partners, and complies with Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the conditions in the Memorandum of Understanding with regard to structural reform are not only about the labour market. They also contain important measures to open up product markets such as overly regulated sectors and professions. These reforms could have a major effect on customer prices and productivity, which support the purchasing power of households. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland. Fine Gael and Labour are part of the PPE and S&amp;D groups respectively in this Parliament. One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU/IMF programme of support to Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU/IMF programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks – both Irish and European – and the government. We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage. We know, however, that recovery cannot happen without pain. Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s. Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU/IMF programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances. We must prune the tree in order to allow growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission’s support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn. This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date. The Commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth, competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run. I accept that; we cannot carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once. The Irish people have taken their responsibilities in this matter; in fact, they have taken other people’s responsibilities as well, because we were given no alternative. What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular. We do not need the straw to break the camel’s back. Please give the Irish people the tools; we will do the job ourselves, but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying. So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not believe that this interference can be justified. The Treaty requires the Commission to promote social dialogue, not undermine it. Article 152 requires respect for the autonomy of social partners, not this type of interference, and Article 153 expressly excludes EU action in the field of play. The Commission cannot pick and choose the hierarchy of articles in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare, the roll-back of key public services, and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions. How can those demands be justified in relation to a Treaty that requires the Union to aim to eliminate inequalities, promote a high level of employment, guarantee adequate social protection and fight against social exclusion? The only honest answer to that is that these things cannot be reconciled, and the problem is that these things have now, as a result of the Annual Growth Survey, become the general rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The people will reject the idea of a Europe based only on austerity. They will not tolerate the far-reaching implications for social policies with lower wages, lower employment protection, weak social standards, reduced public services and the imposition of higher retirement ages. If we want to continue to swell the ranks of anti-Europeanism, then carry on, Commission. If not, please stop this nonsense now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to ask the Commissioner what happens when one article of the Treaty is in direct contradiction with other articles in the Treaty; as Stephen Hughes has asked, how do we decide on the hierarchy? It is in contradiction with Article 153.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also in contradiction with Article 9, the social clause, which I have quoted many times in this Chamber when speaking about the Irish austerity package, where it says that in defining and implementing all its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment and the fight against social exclusion, etc. And what about Article 28 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, under which workers have the rights to negotiate and conclude collective agreements and, in the cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action? Many Irish workers would see that they are in that position at the moment. How do we deal with the contradiction between the different articles in the Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">Another question for you, Commissioner: are you stating that the Memorandum of Understanding was entirely the responsibility of the Irish Government and that the Commission acquiesced or agreed?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us assume here you have the power to do all of this – and you are telling us you have; why then was there no effort to reduce or eliminate bank bonuses? Why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share? Why is it that one euro was deducted from the minimum wage? I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes has said: this fuels anti-European sentiment. Citizens see what is happening. They see how the Commission is working in this whole process, and what they see is that it is those on the minimum wage, those who are in collective agreements, are being hit with these austerity plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally my main question, Commissioner, is: who decides? Is it the Court of Justice? Who decides when articles of the Treaty are in conflict or when the Commission acts in such a way as to bring those articles into conflict with one another? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that conditions are imposed on countries that have to make use of the European Financial Stability Mechanism. However, it seems to me that the Commission is being quite selective in the measures and conditions it deems permitted in this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, nearly any measure seems legal when it comes to fiscal consolidation by cutting expenditure. As soon as Ireland made use of the rescue package, minimum wages and pension levels were the first variables to be adjusted, despite the fact that these matters explicitly are not EU competences. On the other hand, the Commission hides itself behind the lack of EU competence to leave the exceptionally low Irish corporation tax untouched, whereas increasing this could also substantially improve public revenues in Ireland. Cutting expenditure is not, after all, the only way to achieve a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that this crisis requires exceptional measures, but why is the Commission in such a hurry to adjust minimum wages, affecting workers who earn the least, while we have to wait and see about measures that make the banking and financial sector pay? I strongly get the feeling that the Commission is interpreting the EU’s competences in a very one-sided and, dare I say it, right-wing manner. This blunt approach inspires Euro-scepticism. It seems that the EU acts firmly in the field of employment and social policy only in times of crisis, and then does so by imposing cuts in social spending and wages.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU can only regain confidence if the Commission shows the same determination in setting proper minimum social standards and social guarantees for the heavy cuts imposed on people. Yes, we do want economic governance, but we want balanced governance with both fiscal sustainability and social guarantees. If not, the vulnerable will pay the price for a mess that they are not responsible for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work.</p>
<p class="contents">A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first, this country was always celebrated as the ‘showcase’ country and the model for new members of the Union, although at that time, very wrong policies were permitted and encouraged and these resulted in enormous bubbles in the property sector having to be dealt with, the banking sector being allowed to become a law unto itself and no attention being paid to preventing competitive dumping in the area of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have the same nationality as me. We know how many Austrian writers, for example, suddenly discovered that they are Irish, because they had to pay hardly any tax there. What did the supposedly extremely pro-European forces do at that time? Absolutely nothing! They said ‘this country is a wonderful example’.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that has now completely collapsed. This bubble has now turned out to be exactly what many people said it was all along. Once again we have a situation where – and I am not alone in thinking this – anti-European sentiment is being fanned by the fact that we are again allowing the wrong policies to be pursued, in this case by imposing this massive package on Ireland. Commissioner, you say that the Member State is committing itself to this. However, we know from our experience of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes – and what we are currently seeing in Ireland is not so very different from this – that in the end, these countries have no choice.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to take a step back and say ‘it is a shame that Ireland did not reject the Treaty of Lisbon the second time around’, then we could come to a completely different way of thinking. We would then see that, with this European construct, we are dealing with something that could be likened to a vehicle, the front of which consists of a Porsche while the back consists of a bicycle. These two things do not go together. They need to be much stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to prevent this Europe from breaking apart, we actually need something like a Constitution for Europe. We then need clear benchmarks that actually apply to everyone. We need economic governance. This fragmentary approach – forwards, backwards, sidewards – will not work, and in the end, Commissioner, it is more likely to end in disaster than in what you, I and the vast majority of this House are working for, namely, a peaceful, functional and also united Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Irish public deficit, the accumulated budget balance of central and local administrations and, in particular, social security administrations, was estimated at 32% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010. If the Irish Government, which is finding it difficult to refinance itself on the markets, wishes to access loans from the European Financial Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Fund, it will have to meet requirements for social and fiscal change, even though these areas come under subsidiarity. In our view, there is no contradiction here. As a doctor, I would say that, in the case of fever, there is no point prescribing antipyretics indiscriminately without seeking to treat the cause. As far as the allocation of these funds is concerned, this State should get its finances in order so as to correct its excessive deficit and past mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">This austerity plan should improve GDP by 10% over the next four years. As with an individual, to whom a bank will make a personal loan conditional upon meeting the solvency condition without getting involved in their private lives and management, the European Union can lend to Ireland on the basis of consolidated solvency. Without interfering in their private lives, the bank will encourage an individual to negotiate, for example, an increase in salary, or to borrow elsewhere. Thus, by respecting subsidiarity, the European Union, on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding drawn up with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), considers that this solvency requires the reduction of the legal minimum wage and an adjustment of pensions, with fiscal measures nonetheless in the mix. It is up to Ireland to choose whether or not to implement these measures. It does not leave the door wide open for the European Union to interfere in areas falling within subsidiarity, making it possible, for example, to impose a European minimum wage, which would be a dangerous thing to do, but rather ensures the protection of the stability of the euro area through a mutual guarantee process. Of course, it is necessary to help Ireland, like other countries in difficulty, which also protects us, but not at any price, especially that of seeing a State unable to pay off its loans, thus weakening its citizens and citizens throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is total and utter nonsense. It is not supported by practice on the ground. And I would draw the Commission’s attention to the Forfás review of labour cost competitiveness in Ireland, produced late last year, which says that firms generally prefer layoffs to pay cuts because they harm morale less. If you want to look at why we have had more layoffs than wage cuts in Ireland, that is the basis of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the Commission to comply with European law and stop interfering in labour market issues in Ireland. As you say, we have a long tradition of social partnership agreements in Ireland. Indeed, they are the basis of the fact that there has been no violence on the streets in Ireland: it is because the social partners and the government have sat down and made arrangements to adjust the labour market and adjust conditions to ensure that we can have some hope of recovery from the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">That tradition has ensured progress in Ireland, but the programme generally is failing to do what it was intended to do, which was to assist the economy in Ireland to grow. It is not growing. In fact, it is in decline, and that programme has to be generally renegotiated. I would suggest in particular that the issues relating to the labour market have to be removed. As has already been stated, the Irish Government, of which my party is a member, has already declared that it will reverse the minimum wage cut as agreed in that programme.</p>
<p class="contents">You may be unhappy with that, but that is going to happen. You can be certain as well that your attempt to interfere with the Registered Employment Agreements Act, which has been in place for more than 50 years, will not be interfered with, as you hope, because the current government is determined that social partnership will play its traditional role in ensuring that we have industrial peace and progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact, with the proposals of so-called economic governance and the so-called competitiveness pact had not been passed, particularly the attempt to prevent wages from rising with inflation and increase the legal age for retirement, we would have even more serious attacks on labour and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What is already happening in this field in certain countries, such as Portugal, Greece or Ireland, and which is of the utmost seriousness, are salary cuts and pension freezes, even on the lowest pensions and those below the poverty line. In the case of Portugal, a salary cut on the national minimum wage was already planned for the beginning of this year. It was felt that EUR 500 was too much per month, and it was decided to cut this by EUR 15, despite the fact that more than 13% of female Portuguese workers receive only this amount, compared with 6% of male workers. This is a clear example of institutionalised discrimination and the effect of the so-called austerity measures that the Commission, together with the Council and the governments of our countries, is implementing, with the subsequent exacerbation of social inequality, discrimination, the devaluing of work and increased poverty, while the indulgence of financial speculation and tax havens continues. We therefore express our solidarity with the young workers and teachers who are going to protest over the forthcoming weekends, including this Saturday, 12 March, and at the large national demonstration by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) in Lisbon on 19 March. This will continue the fight against these antisocial policies.</p>

<p class="contents">On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States. The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side. That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy. My fellow Member has just mentioned this. You are chipping away at codetermination. You are weakening the trade unions. That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it.</p>

There is little doubt that their capacity to overcome the crisis varies and there is a need to find ways of balancing the budget and reducing the budget deficit. However, Commissioner, must we really do this at the expense of those who are worst off? Is it morally right for the European Commission to pressure governments into reducing the minimum wage, pensions or other social benefits? Commissioner, you gave your opinion on the Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland. However, I would like to remind you that you signed a similar memorandum with Latvia, where you pressed the Latvian Government to reduce pensions that were already low. Pensions in Latvia were reduced, but the Latvian Constitutional Court stated that the country’s fundamental law does not allow this and the pensions were reinstated. Thus, when taking such decisions and signing such memoranda, it is necessary to thoroughly assess both the legal and social consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How is that supposed to happen? The proposals for decentralised wage negotiations are unfair, unimaginative and they are a diversionary tactic, because it is so difficult to tax asset and financial speculation and the Heads of State or Government are not succeeding in getting genuine macro-economic coordination off the ground. In this regard, we in Parliament have already set a very different benchmark this week with our vote on the financial transactions tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you all of the principle of the social market economy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. My conception of the social market economy is rather different – it would not include decentralised wage negotiations, quite the opposite, in fact. Decentralised wage negotiation systems are contrary to a wage policy based on solidarity and rather than leading to the gap between rich and poor getting smaller, they will – on the contrary – result in it getting bigger. In other words, we should do the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to expressly repeat what my colleague, Mrs Steinruck, said – we cannot repeat it often enough: we must take more action to tackle the cause of the crisis; make those who caused the crisis pay to a greater extent; and focus on them for the resolution of these problems, including by means of legislative measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not obvious that we can achieve this alignment. Productivity depends primarily on factors such as accumulated capital stock, which is very different. The clear disparity can be seen between Romania and Germany. This is due to the difference in quality of economic policies over time. Indeed, such discrepancies cannot be made up overnight. My country has made efforts towards reforming pensions and social assistance. I would therefore like to suggest including some provisions of this kind in the competitiveness pact. I support the need for a correlation between the retirement age and demographic trends.

We are discussing pension systems which are unsustainable as a consequence of common challenges such as the financial crisis, as well as of an ageing population and declining birth rate. The principle of intergenerational solidarity is at risk of becoming obsolete, with citizens being forced to contribute to private pensions. However, what happens to those who no longer have enough time to contribute to such pensions? European citizens also depend on public pensions. In Romania, the gross national minimum wage is approximately EUR 160. This is why I believe that investing in private pensions or saving is just pure fantasy. I think that the European Commission needs to be more involved by proposing both a minimum EU salary and pension level.

<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, I welcome the involvement of the trade unions, yesterday in Hungary, for example, or in Brussels on 29 September. It is time our Commissioners heeded the message of European workers if they do not wish to widen the gap between themselves and the citizens, who will believe less and less in the European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can promise you that we give serious consideration to each of them. Let me first say a few words about the importance and relevance of social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully recognise the importance of social dialogue and constructive industrial relations. We have continuously engaged with the social partners, both at EU level and in individual countries. For instance, Commissioner Rehn personally met with Ireland’s trade union leaders in early November, as did officials from the Commission, the ECB and the IMF when negotiating the programme in late November. They will continue to engage on the next mission in April and on subsequent occasions. By the way, contrary to some allegations, the Commission did not force Ireland to cut the minimum wage or social expenditure. These measures were already presented by the former Irish Government itself in its national recovery plan, together with other fiscal and structural measures aiming at economic stability, growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal basis of the economic policy conditions is Article 3(5) of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 establishing a European financial stabilisation mechanism and Article 2(2) of the Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU on granting Union financial assistance to Ireland. Once again, both are grounded in Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mere fact that the Memorandum of Understanding’s specific economic policy conditions touch upon various issues that are linked to social policy does not put into question the legal basis of the act. There appears to be no contradiction with Article 152 or Article 153(5). Article 152 is a general provision which does not exclude the possible need for specific measures with social consequences. Moreover, that provision does not create subjective rights for the social partners. Article 153(5) is a limit as regards the content of the measures that can be adopted under Article 153, i.e. social policy. Since the MoU is not adopted on the basis of Article 153, this limit does not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions of Title 10, social policy, cannot be disregarded. They have to be taken into account, but it does not mean that as a consequence of Article 153(5), no measures having an effect on pay can be adopted on the basis of Article 122. The measures adopted on the basis of Article 122 for Ireland do not regulate issues. They provide for conditions linked to the granting of Union assistance. This is explicitly allowed by Article 122(2). Therefore, there is no legal problem as regards the principle of conferral.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the issue of economic policy conditions is not about EU competences in the field of social policy or wages. The conditions included in the programme cover a wide range of policy areas, and for most of them, the competence lies with the Member State. The economic policy conditions of the programme are Member State commitments agreed with the EU and the IMF on the measures that the Member States will undertake in exchange for EU/IMF financing.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final note, the Commission fully acknowledged that any financial assistance programme naturally has social consequences. However, the main goal of the specific economic policy conditions attached to such a programme is to avoid much graver social consequences by setting the country back on the path of sustained growth and job creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 20 of the 27 Member States, the minimum income is set by law or by national inter-sector agreement. In 11 Member States, the minimum income is between EUR 100 and 400/month, in 5 Member States, it is between EUR 550 and 950/month, and in 6 Member States, it is more than EUR 1 100/month.</p>

I regard social dialogue as being particularly important in terms of ensuring social fairness and a decent standard of living for all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission and Member States to guarantee equal pay for equal work in the internal labour market, the lifting of barriers preventing the free movement of workers and the examination of the possibility of providing a minimum salary agreed by law or based on collective negotiation, which will guarantee European citizens a decent standard of living. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

The importance of this issue was outlined. Since then, various disasters have hit Europe and have had severely negative consequences for the public, the land, the economy and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the Commission’s communication followed a proper approach, albeit an inadequate one, as was considered by Parliament. In addition, the Commission is delaying in implementing the commitments it assumed in this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this is its commitment to draw up a list of preventative measures to be funded by the European Union and implemented by the Member States. Two years later, and where is this list? Is the Commission going to wait for the next multiannual financial framework before presenting it? Another two years from now?</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in September of last year, Parliament adopted a report on this very matter. This report puts forward a set of important recommendations. It is important to say that this report was preceded by a much wider debate, not only here in Parliament, but also with a wide range of national, regional and local entities, operating in different phases of disaster management.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also gathered a lot of experience of these catastrophes with the people who were affected by disasters over the last year. Here, I would like to mention a few of the specific points of the report, from the many that it contains. A range of actions were defined as targets for special support to the Member States, with a view to remedying situations of risk in areas such as forest management, the protection and defence of the coastline, restoring and protecting river basins, the protection and remodelling of populated areas which are particularly vulnerable to certain types of catastrophes and the maintenance of farming activities in the areas affected by depopulation and which are at risk of natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">How has the Commission included, or how is it thinking of including, these areas in the list of measures to be drawn up? The report also proposes the creation of public agricultural insurance in Europe and the institution of a system of minimum compensation to farmers affected by disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">I notice that this is very different from the current possibility that the Member States will subsidise insurance internally, with the CAP Health Check. What is proposed is insurance financed by Community funds on an equal footing as regards protection against disasters, for all farmers, whether they are from the Member States most in need, or whether they are from rich countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, disasters are deeply unfair, and they almost always have the greatest effect on those who are least able to protect themselves, be they people or countries. If there is one area in which the tangible expression of EU solidarity and the principle of cohesion must be ensured, it is in the protection of the public, the economy and the environment, in the face of disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask here what the Commission is going to do to reduce the existing imbalances between the regions and the Member States in this area, in other words, helping to improve prevention in regions and Member States with a greater exposure to risk and lower economic capacity. Another area covered in the report is strengthening early warning systems in the Member States and establishing connections between the various early warning systems. Which steps have already been taken in this area? Which steps will they take next? Finally, it is worth recalling that following on from prevention, and bearing in mind the experience gained during recent disasters, it is becoming imperative to revise the regulations for the Solidarity Fund to allow for a more flexible and timely mobilisation of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the Commission already done, or what is it going to do, for this review? I recall that a year ago, Madeira was struck by a major disaster which resulted in fatalities and high levels of material damage to strategic infrastructures and basic equipment. It is now one year later, and Madeira has still not received a single cent of aid at all from the EU. What will the Commission do to change this situation, when the regulation of the Solidarity Fund currently says that ‘it should help to quickly restore normal living conditions, and it should act swiftly and efficiently to help, as quickly as possible, in mobilising emergency services’? Where is this speed when, one year later, Madeira has still not received a single cent in aid from the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, once again I urge the Commission to take the broad consensus that this report attracted, when it was voted upon and discussed, as a clear sign that these recommendations, the recommendations contained in this report, are to be put into practice. Many of these recommendations were already contained in previous Parliament resolutions, but unfortunately nothing was done and the Commission bears particular responsibility for this delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The disasters of last year were a salutary reminder that the EU and its Member States need to step up work on disaster prevention. We need to be ambitious. We all know that investing in disaster prevention pays off. At the same time, ensuring cost-effective and increased investment in disaster prevention is a challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now assessing the effectiveness of existing EU financing instruments. We are also developing a catalogue of prevention measures that would be considered by Member States for EU funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to increase the impact of EU funding and to accelerate the implementation of Regional Fund support. We are also looking at innovative financing instruments, such as insurance pooling to share risks. Effective investments in disaster prevention will help to save lives, limit damages and, ultimately, save money.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions are also under way to improve our knowledge of disasters. We have worked with the European Environment Agency on a report assessing the frequency of disasters in Europe and their impact on humans, the economies and ecosystems. We also need clear and transparent assessments of the risks we face.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 December last year, we issued a guidance paper on national risk assessment and mapping to encourage Member States in fostering a comprehensive risk-management culture. Developing fully-fledged risk management policies will require the involvement of all actors. The increased frequency and intensity of disasters in Europe should also provide further incentives for Member States to invest in preparedness and build up their capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the prevention elements, it is equally important that Member States, and Europe as a whole, are able to provide the best possible response. In October last year, we outlined our policy proposal for a European disaster-response capacity. Our objective is to improve the efficiency, the coherence and the visibility of the EU’s response to disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When disasters happen – be they man-made or natural – we must stand together in Europe. That is central to European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The second keyword that we must mention here is speed. It is important to provide help quickly, because rapid assistance is the most effective form of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, however, I must point out that it is, first and foremost, the Member States that are responsible for protecting the population, where possible, from such disasters. We must examine how we can use European resources and also the funds that are available to us in a more efficient and more effective way. However, I should point out that many Member States call for European resources in order to conceal the fact that they are taking inadequate measures themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do at EU level? We have two major expense items: firstly, the European Regional Development Fund for which Commissioner Hahn is responsible, and secondly, the Agricultural Fund, in which regard we could make better use of the funds that are already available. Prevention is key. That is to say, very many disasters, flooding in particular, could be prevented by means of proper spatial planning. We already have a Floods Directive, in connection with which it was clear that we could actually achieve a great deal with our existing resources if we took the right measures – such as mapping, risk assessment and, as a third measure, the creation of preventative action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Commission, in addition to the prevention measures that it has drawn up, to look, in particular, at the areas of droughts and water shortages. In these areas, we still lack an instrument like the Floods Directive, and we could do a great deal here.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the catalogue of prevention measures itself, I have to say that mainstreaming is surely crucial in this regard; in other words, that we try to take these aspects into account in other policy areas. Under the supervision of the Commission, the Member States must also draw up risk maps for all areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been promised progress in setting up a network of competent national services in Member States.

The statistics indicate that, in the last 20 years, 953 disasters have occurred in Europe, causing almost 90 000 deaths and economic losses amounting to USD 269 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">To be able to counter the effects caused by these phenomena, a risk chart is required, along with a coherent plan for managing environmental factors. The preservation and extension of forested areas, as well as green belts in urban environments, must be a priority for all of us. It is vital for us to give the importance that is due to the activities of informing and educating the general public with the aim of preventing the repercussions of disasters. The International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction is a good example of this. I also think that all the instruments need to be made more effective …</p>

As the old adage says, ‘prevention is better than cure’ and certainly we have to try and prevent natural disasters based on recent trends, to get out some kind of a forecast and to put preventive actions in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need some type of a trans-European insurance mechanism, because otherwise, affected areas will not be able to afford insurance. For instance, in my own area, in the town of Clonmel, insurance has gone up sixfold because of the risk of flooding.</p>

Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon has introduced a solidarity clause for the provision of assistance to Member States suffering the consequences of natural disasters.</p>

Wherever a direct appeal has been made to the competence of my colleague, Mrs Georgieva, we will provide you with written answers, for example, with regard to the status of talks and negotiations with Russia on the question of information and monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to take this opportunity – since the European Solidarity Fund falls within my remit – to tell you that this Fund is an instrument that was created seven or eight years ago and that is not financed from the budget. Whenever a disaster occurs, a very complex procedure has to be followed – firstly, there is an assessment and then there is also the codecision of the European Parliament and the Council – which can result in delays.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Madeira, I can tell you that within the next 14 days, we will get a signature and payment. The delay was also caused by the fact that the Member State was very late in providing a lot of the necessary information. This also needs to be taken into account. At the end of the day, we also need to be able to demonstrate, and it must also be possible to verify, what the funds have actually been used for. Nevertheless, the structure of the Solidarity Fund should also continue to be developed. Discussions to this effect are also ongoing within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of drought assessment is – quite frankly – relatively difficult to incorporate. The situation is different with regard to technological disasters, for example. These issues need to be reassessed in the light of the experience we have gained in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the funds provided in the area of the structural funds for example, a total of EUR 7.5 billion is available Europe-wide in the current financial period for risk prevention and corresponding environmental protection measures. Of this, around 20% has already been allocated to specific projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As MEPs for an electoral district or <span class="italic">Land</span>, you know as well as I do that administrative problems often arise between regions and Member States because it is not clear who is responsible for what. In practice, that often results in delays in the implementation of projects. Overcoming these problems would be an important achievement, because it is in the interests of the people and the regions for us to actually use the money that has been made available and not to founder on account of administrative or bureaucratic problems or to allow these problems to cause delays.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we actually intend to put forward a legislative proposal at the end of the year for how we can take a more focused approach with regard to the way we monitor and respond to disasters throughout Europe. I would like to thank you once again for your commitment and persistence on this matter and I would like to ask you also to continue – and I will finish by saying this – to pay such a high level of attention to implementation and to utilising the financial resources that are, in principle, available in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to note that the way the New Zealand Government handled the notification of those who are deaf and hard of hearing during its most recent catastrophe is an inspiring example that must be put into practice. At the end of 2010, the government of New Zealand published several resource materials, as well as a DVD, which prepared the affected players, the authorities and the population using sign language for a potential catastrophe. This practice saved lives as well as property. According to local civil organisations and the World Federation of the Deaf (www.wfdeaf.org), the government of Queensland and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) should be proud – in spite of the tragedies which, regrettably, still occurred – of the success achieved by their excellent preparation and cooperation, and particularly of providing live and immediate communication that reached the deaf. In light of this, I hope that the Commission will review the good practice of this non-EU Member State and popularise and promote its implementation in Member States, as well as within the scope of the application of EU resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis that ensued affected more than 10 million travellers and had serious economic repercussions. The resolution of the volcanic ash crisis left a lot to be desired due to the lack of coordination between institutions, the lack of specifications and flexibility, not to mention failure to make optimum use of the technical resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I said it then and I continue to maintain that it is of paramount importance for the necessary measures to be taken so that we can ensure that a new volcanic eruption will not have the same consequences. Responsibility for flight safety, which includes avoiding areas contaminated by ash, must lie with the operator and crew. Operators must be supplied with accurate data so that they can implement the best solutions. Pilots are trained to cope with exceptional air conditions and have the experience required to evaluate the risk and make decisions about redirecting the flight.</p>
<p class="contents">The following elements are required to make this process operate as efficiently as possible: supervision and forecasting must be improved and more money must be invested in equipment on the ground and in the air. The technical structure must be able to supply accurate data in real time and constant forecasts, which can be provided by current technology. The use of several centres for collecting and supplying this information will improve the risk evaluation and relevant flight scheduling. The role of crisis management institutions must be clarified to ensure that operators receive this information which they need for making decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulatory body must be responsible for supervision, while Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres are responsible for notifying air navigation service providers about eruptions and high-risk areas. Service providers must inform air crews about the areas at high risk of ash contamination. The parties involved must be trained in effective crisis management using simulation exercises.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is an absolute requirement for EASA to draw up the specifications required to clarify responsibilities and control at operational level. Achieving the Single European Sky and implementing SESAR would facilitate enormously the decision-making process and would reduce significantly the impact in the event of a crisis. I believe that these are the key points which need to be resolved so that we can ensure that we are prepared to manage such a situation successfully in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What became clear last year was that Member States and the EU as a whole had no plan for such an eventuality, the data used was incomplete, the meteorologists could not or, indeed, would not help, and everybody perfected the art of blaming someone else and adopted a policy of risk aversion rather than one of risk management.</p>
<p class="contents">To be frank, Mr President, Member States bottled it last year. But, Mr President, that was then. What about the future? Do we have a comprehensive plan to cover the next volcanic eruption? Should this happen, will Member States coordinate at EU level in future? Crucially, will they involve the aviation industry and, particularly, airlines before they issue their advice? We have to avoid the mistakes made last year which gave us the nonsense of one country closing its airspace whilst a neighbouring country kept theirs open, leading to chaos, confusion and huge economic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Mr President, the Icelandic volcano highlighted one major thing: it has strengthened the argument for a Single European Sky better than any politician could have done. Our role now is to develop and deliver this as a matter of urgency, even though, as usual, the Member States are back to their old habits of dragging their feet on this much-needed project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, it was a force of nature that brought air traffic to a complete standstill. Eyjafjallajökull – everyone probably knows of this volcano now – erupted last year and brought a large proportion of air traffic to a complete standstill. Incidentally, I just noticed once again during the previous speech that we have an excellent chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, because what he said is very similar to what I wanted to say. I will now try to change my speech somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">It was indeed chaos – Mr Simpson has already said that. As Europeans, with high-tech capabilities and with so much already coordinated, we were, in fact, helpless when it came to dealing with this disaster and finding solutions to it. We realised that there were too few agreements in place. We then set up a task force. The questions that concerned us with regard to this issue were whether the task force actually has any valid results already that could be discussed and has it published any studies? I do not know of any at least. Have all of the international experts on such volcanic eruptions actually been consulted? After all, as we already discussed here in plenary last year, there are other parts of the world where volcanic eruptions are much more frequent than in Europe and they somehow manage to have up-to-date data and to coordinate the whole situation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also something else that causes me concern. On 4 May, it was also mentioned in the Council of transport ministers that we need a linked-up European transport system. That can, of course, help in such cases. How far have we come in terms of being able to respond better in the event of a further volcanic eruption? We cannot predict this, of course. It will just happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one further question: do we know exactly what technology we would need to be able to deal with this situation better? In Germany, we now have appropriate devices at all weather stations that collect the data and are able to pass on this up-to-date data very quickly to the people responsible at the airlines and also to pilots so that they can decide whether or not it is safe to fly.</p>
<p class="contents">One further point which has not been mentioned yet but which I think is important in this context is the following: this ash crisis, and the subsequent problems it posed for the air transport industry, affected 10 million passengers and, of course, also many companies. Some passengers were stranded and were unable to continue their journeys. The question therefore arises as to how things stand with regard to passengers’ rights. We have rights for air passengers, but I have the impression that, in this case, they have not always been fully utilised. Perhaps we should also revise these passenger rights once more.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of questions here. Mr Hahn, I do not know whether you will be able to answer them now, as transport is not actually your area. Otherwise, I am sure that the questions I raised in addition to the written question can be answered later. You will notice that this subject is of great concern to us. After all, the air transport industry is very important, and we therefore need a Single European Sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nearly a year has gone by since these events, and it is possible that they will simply be forgotten. Nevertheless, we wanted to ensure that this issue was still important to the Commission and we await the Commissioner’s action on these promised issues as a lesson from last year’s volcanic eruption. In effect, it proved that the aviation market is possibly the European Union’s domestic market to an extent unlike no other mode of transport across Europe. That, in turn, means that taking decisions, as well as their preparation, possibly requires a process that differs from that required for other modes of transport. It is a question of the absence of these data and the non-participation of the operators in the decision-making process, as well as of the fact that the decision is taken at Member State level. In principle, of course, this has its basis in law. However, even though I belong to a political group that always supports the principle of subsidiarity, on this occasion, I think that, taking into account the actual situation last year, we ought to consider on the basis of this example whether decisions should not be taken at European level to a greater extent. Passengers are also concerned that different airlines behave differently towards passengers, and to always obtain compensation from these airlines through the courts is not the easiest thing. Clearly, we should not have a situation where different airlines can emerge from this crisis in different ways, with different costs. Finally, the third point I should like to stress is the lesson that can be drawn from this crisis, namely, that in the European Union, various ‘islands’ exist, as it were, that are not connected by different modes of transport to other European Union Member States. This means that when planning the TEN-T map this year and the TEN-T budget for the next financial perspective, as well as the cohesion policy budget, we should allow for investment in other modes of transport, so that we can connect these ‘islands’ to the rest of the European Union. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission therefore proposed immediate actions to coordinate the EU’s position and to strengthen the regulatory framework. This makes Europe a stronger partner at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively engaged in practical work to refine the existing volcanic ash avoidance methodologies in aviation. For example, the Commission has launched a specific call under the Seventh Framework Programme called ‘Technology support for crisis coordination for the air transport system following major disrupting events’. In parallel, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is preparing rules for air-worthiness requirements and risk assessment for safe flight in airspace with volcanic contaminants.</p>
<p class="contents">From an operational perspective, an approach has been developed in close cooperation with the EASA. This approach reflects practices in other parts of the world. The guiding principles are as follows: first, the airline is responsible for the safety of its operations. Before operating in airspace contaminated by volcanic ash, the airline must produce a safety risk assessment and have it accepted by its supervising authority. This process must be repeated when important changes occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the airline must show that the information sources it uses in its safety risk assessment are correct. It also has to show its own competence and capability to interpret such data correctly. Before starting operations, the airline must obtain from the manufacturers specific information regarding the susceptibility of the aircraft to the effects of airborne ash and the impact of such ash on its airworthiness. This must be reflected in the safety risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">In dealing with disruptive events such as this, a key element is collaborative decision making between Member States and industry. To ensure comprehensive and coordinated actions, the Commission, together with Eurocontrol, established a European Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell, following the Council of Transport Ministers meeting of 4 May 2010. Since its creation, the cell has met on several occasions to develop its structures and procedures. To test and verify its timely functionality, this cell will be part of a volcano exercise planned for 13 and 14 April 2011 under the auspices of the UN’s aviation body, the ICAO.</p>
<p class="contents">The volcanic ash crisis highlighted the crucial importance of the Single European Sky. The Commission has therefore accelerated its implementation via, for example, the adoption of the SES Performance Scheme and the associated EU-wide performance targets, the adoption of implementing rules for network management functions, the designation of the network manager, the adoption of implementing rules and guidance material for the functional airspace blocks, the nomination of the former MEP, Mr Georg Jarzembowski, as the functional airspace blocks coordinator and the expected finalisation by April 2011 of the extension of the EASA’s competence for safety regulation in the field of air traffic management.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me therefore conclude by saying that the Commission is continuing to work on these very complex and technical issues. The Commission is working together with EASA, ICAO, Member States and industry to ensure the safety of European airspace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One thing was clear: more than 100 000 flights were cancelled and 300 airports and more than 10 million passengers were affected. We must learn lessons from such an event. That is also the reason for the question that we are raising today, because there was a very quick call for coordination and this was clearly not forthcoming. It is not possible to improvise coordinated action in the space of 24 hours. These are the questions that we want answers to today, and it is not only Parliament that wants these answers; the citizens of Europe want them, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing we want to know is has the information relating to both the effects and the location of such phenomena improved or not?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what role will EU bodies play in this regard in future and what powers of decision will they have? Will we continue to have 27 simultaneously existing decisions, or does the Commission already have other proposals, and to what extent will the airlines be involved here? This question has come up very often.</p>
<p class="contents">The Crisis Committee is supposed to meet – it does meet and will also carry out tests. It would be extremely important for this Parliament and therefore also for European citizens to be informed of the results of these tests.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to coordination, it is important for this to be established outside the EU, too. We also need to agree on structures at international level, as the airspace and also certain disasters know no boundaries in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important factor as far as we are concerned is the passengers. We talk about 10 million passengers, but these 10 million passengers were not only tourists who had to or were happy to extend their holidays; there were also people who had to get home or had to get somewhere urgently. In this case, we cannot simply refer to passengers’ rights; rather, we are under obligation to work in a coordinated way and to provide alternatives and greater use of other modes of transport. For example, we need a more rapid allocation of rail routes when this is necessary. This is also not possible to improvise in the space of 24 hours. These are questions that we want to raise on behalf of citizens and passengers, too. It is not just a question of explaining their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least – and you mentioned this – the airspace blocks, or what are referred to as FABs: the proposal is to have seven instead of 27. That could work. However, I would simply venture to predict today that we will not manage to do this by 2012, because the Member States do not want it. In this regard, we must also send a very clear outward signal that a reduction in the number of airspace blocks is absolutely necessary. It can work, too. Mr Hahn, I invite you to come to Maastricht – it is not very far for you to come. There, cooperation between three or four countries in respect of the upper layer of the airspace is already in place. That is where all of the problems that the countries bring up are solved. Go there, suggest it to the Commission, and use it as a model for Europe, for the seven FABs. We will then be able to regulate this within twelve months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I was, like others, a victim of the ash cloud. I was travelling to Baku and could only get back with great difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">This concerns all European citizens. It was an opportunity for Europe to show its added value – and we failed. I think European citizens understood that the EU was not yet prepared for taking a single action, but we have to make sure that we are ready to take a single action in the next similar case. Therefore, I think that the need for the Single European Sky project is imperative. We all agree on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am not a member of the Transport Committee, I would like to mention that not only a Single European Sky is needed, but also a single European infrastructure connected to this. Therefore, here in this plenary session, I would like to draw attention to the need for Galileo and for GMES – as they are potentially a great European infrastructure if we can build them – to deliver on that purpose. This is why we are working to get the budget lines for those issues, but we have to explain better to European citizens why these projects are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I wanted to take the floor to make the point that, alongside European policies, European infrastructure in this field is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That caused considerable financial losses and, above all, as previous speakers have pointed out, more than 10 million people, not all of whom were on tourist trips, had to postpone their journeys and find other means of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a result of the havoc wrought by a wholly natural event, which placed us in an important context in relation to nature, and which caused unprecedented paralysis in the skies above Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, difficult to predict a volcanic eruption and, even more so, the formation of a volcanic ash cloud – more difficult, of course, than predicting a snow episode. However, the crisis caused by this cloud highlights all the shortcomings and deficiencies of air traffic management in the Union as well as the weakness and absence of a number of management tools.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these three factors, I would like to put forward three proposals for recovery: firstly, regarding imperative comodality; secondly, concerning the need for the Community method to respond to such challenges; thirdly, and naturally at the heart of our concerns, relating to the rights of passengers, which are central to our concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first element, the crisis has highlighted the fact that it was absolutely crucial to strengthen comodality in European transport, since the cloud highlighted the limits not only of aviation systems at European level but, more especially, of rail travel, since countless travellers were unable to find an alternative. As demonstrated in the studies that have been carried out over the last year, one can image that, with more comodality, the scale of the crisis would not have been so huge and the paralysis would have been somewhat less.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second element, as in the financial crisis and in the debates we are having on the Community method compared with intergovernmental operations, here, in the area of transport, intergovernmental operations or a fragmented response from 27 Member States are not what will resolve the difficulties we have encountered and which may return, but rather a genuinely Community method. That would require strengthening the competences of Eurocontrol in a Community system and, of course, as has been pointed out, completing the Single European Sky as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are the passengers, who are at the heart and the centre of our concerns ...</p>

However, safety must remain the guiding principle for the future, too. A few improvements that we can achieve at European level are necessary, however.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, how about improving our common measuring systems? Do we now have strategies in place for how and with what division of labour such pollution incidents can be measured so that we can issue halfway reliable statements more quickly? I know that this is extremely difficult to do, particularly on account of meteorological conditions, but I would like to know whether any progress has been made here with regard to coordination, so that we are at least taking measurements and evaluating them according to the same criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, this crisis caused by the volcanic ash has shown how vulnerable our highly equipped air transport system now is – that is something that is obvious to all of us already at our airports. Under normal operating conditions, two or three delays already have a whole series of consequences, making use of the service under normal operating conditions more and more difficult, let alone if there is the additional problem of external weather events or something like a volcanic ash crisis; the situation then becomes one of utter chaos. We have no error-tolerant system, and in this area, we also need to make improvements, as a system is only as good as its ability to respond in an error-tolerant manner in relevant cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also become apparent that we are facing a serious shortcoming, namely, the general lack of cooperation between rail, road and air transport. Precisely because we have insufficient cooperation, it was hardly possible to take appropriate compensatory measures on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Single Sky, the necessity of which has become apparent here – as coordinated measures would, in any case, have been better – I would say that, as long as each Member State is convinced that it is the only one that is truly capable of controlling its own airspace efficiently and that all of the others are absolutely incapable of doing so – and I am talking here about our airspace in Central Europe – we will not make any progress in this regard. This egotism damages European cooperation and, ultimately, also the European idea. We need to be clear about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been mentioned, over 100 000 flights were cancelled, tens of millions of business and holiday passengers were not able to travel as planned, goods and cargo were delayed or not transported at all, businesses were affected and our European carriers and airports suffered catastrophic financial losses. All in all, it cost the European airlines more than EUR 2 billion. Institutions across Europe and in Member States who were responsible for dealing with such issues were absolutely paralysed and, quite frankly, if it had not been so serious, it would have been practically laughable.</p>
<p class="contents">In all this chaos, one thing was clear. Air transport is enormously important for the European economy and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative. As such, I am delighted to support this oral question, not least because during our previous plenary debate on this issue, I called for the European Union to look at international best practice on dealing with volcanic ash and, more particularly, highlighted America, which has always applied a more measured approach in this regard. I certainly welcomed the fact that the Commission, in its assessment of the crisis, accepted that Europe needed to revise procedures through the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">International best practice tells us that responsibility for dealing with potential hazards related to volcanic ash must be transferred to the airline operators as part of their safety management systems. The role of the authorities is to audit the airline safety management system to ensure that it meets the required safety standards. This is the procedure applied by the US and other countries which have managed to deal with volcanic eruptions without major disruptions to air traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear and decisive joined-up leadership is essential and we need the European Aviation Safety Agency to ensure that EU Member States adapt their current procedures to guarantee that airline operators will take responsibility and be supported in making such decisions in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the crisis in April and May last year made it absolutely clear that as a priority, we need to push for the full implementation of the Single European Sky and SESAR. Both European industry and the taxpayer have already invested huge sums of money in these projects and, as European lawmakers, we must continue to push forward well balanced, cost-effective and structural reforms. I welcome the comments by the Commissioner today. Let us hope that we move forward now in a positive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand that volcanoes do not follow any rules and we cannot exclude unforeseen circumstances. All of this is about the survival of the aviation industry, but aircraft are hampered not just by volcanoes, but also by storms, snow and similar phenomena. Understandably, it is impossible to eliminate, stop or predict everything that may happen in aviation. Clearly, aircraft safety, people’s lives and their mobility must rank among our most important considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that a comprehensive programme is being pursued by implementing the Single Sky initiative in order to modernise air traffic management. I agree with my fellow Member who said just now that a common infrastructure also needs to be established. However, while I am on the subject, I would like to say that today, we should consider and discuss the development of alternative transport. We need and must achieve greater progress in this area. This crisis had a particular impact on the European Union’s eastern Member States, which remained separated from part of Western Europe and, unlike the other European Union Member States, did not have sufficient opportunity to choose alternative modes of transport. We now know that we urgently need to establish a alternative secondary mobility system, trans-European networks, rail networks, an alternative to air transport, such as has wisely been done with regard to electricity and telecommunications networks. Therefore, given the financial perspectives, more ambitious goals need to be set when reviewing the trans-European networks. Land transport and, above all, railways should be able to replace air transport more smoothly if the latter is withdrawn. The time has come to consider specific alternatives and to implement these as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people were unable to get to the funerals of their relatives, their children’s weddings or similar occasions. They were very personal, regrettable incidents, not to speak of the financial cost incurred through the suffering of 10 million people. As you see, nothing actually worked.</p>
<p class="contents">We were unable to reply that the EU had a solution to these situations, and here, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism correctly said that this risk could not have been anticipated, it could not have been controlled, and the whole thing was more like complete chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Commission should give the public the answers it wants as quickly as possible: the answers to whether we have technical solutions or whether the airlines will discover them. If there are any, what might they be? What will the rights of passengers be in the future, if the same situation arises, where people cannot fly or get home? When will there be an effective common European airspace? The answer people want, obviously, is as soon as possible, so that this cannot continue for much longer. What is the alternative plan? What means of transport are to be used? This time, people were at a loss. Others ordered taxis from Spain to Finland, paying thousands of euro in fares. This situation cannot be repeated in the future: there should be a plan in place for how people can be better served as regards these alternative arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I wish to raise another issue mentioned here, and another natural upheaval: snow. Tens of thousands of people in December were stranded at airports in Europe when it snowed. In my own country, Finland, there is continual heavy snow and there are harsh frosts, but things work. We therefore have to get European airports to work properly too. This is not too difficult and we cannot just give up: matters should be dealt with so as to guarantee citizen’s access to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In spite of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres in London and Toulouse, which are part of an international network of nine such centres set up by the ICAO, and the specialist London centre producing volcanic ash cloud risk charts, we also need to improve the European infrastructure by introducing a system for measuring the concentration of volcanic ash clouds in real time.</p>

It is the effect that this crisis had on passengers that I wish to draw the Commission’s attention to today.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 10 million people were affected and the cancellations resulted in significant economic costs for thousands of passengers. While airports have signs and leaflets informing travellers of their rights, this is often of little use when faced with cancellations or major travel disruptions such as that caused by the ash cloud. Under EU legislation, passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in reality, the majority of passengers whose travel has been disrupted will spend a lot of time and money chasing down information, seeking alternative tickets or compensation with airlines. This is an issue that the Commission needs be more effective on. The biggest frustration that passengers face in situations like this is trying to get information, trying to get in contact with the airlines. Although they are aware of their rights, this is of little help to them if they are stranded in an airport or on hold to an airline.</p>
<p class="contents">While I appreciate that, at the time of the ash crisis, airlines were under unprecedented pressure to deal with thousands of passengers – and I must admit that some did admirably – in general, it is very difficult for people to get information and assistance when it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The travel chaos as a result of the bad weather in December 2010 further demonstrates this. Passengers require up-to-date information but they need to be able to reach the airlines in order to exercise their rights. Airlines, airport customer services and information need to be more accessible to passengers whose travel has been disrupted. It is not enough to inform European Union citizens of their passenger rights; they must be assisted in exercising them in times of travel chaos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if we compare it with the floods and the simultaneous hurricane in Australia or with the earthquake in Christchurch in New Zealand, we all escaped unharmed. Safety had absolute priority, and rightly so. Commissioner Kallas made the right decision in agreement with the EU transport ministers in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot understand the criticism directed at the airlines. They clearly suffered a loss – a figure of 2 billion was mentioned. However, it is wrong to lay the responsibility as to whether or not flights go ahead at the feet of the airlines. That decision must be made at a political level. Safety must be given top priority. Imagine if an aeroplane had crashed as a result of the volcanic ash. We would have had a completely different debate, namely, how irresponsible it was to even allow one aeroplane to take off.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a plan B, as has quite rightly been said, and the rail system is the alternative. As a result of their exemption from fuel tax, airlines receive EUR 30 billion per year from European taxpayers. This money must be invested in the rail system, at least in parts of it, so that we have an alternative in the event of this sort of disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety first – that is what people are calling for, and rightly so. It must also be the case in the future, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this nonetheless shows the undoubted scale of the paralysis in which we found ourselves. Of course, the previous speakers who spoke about a certain alternative in the form of developing the rail network are right. That is obvious. In the field of aviation, the answer to this problem is definitely better coordination and strengthening of the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency. In addition, it is good that in November, the European Parliament adopted a suitable regulation on this matter. It was a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come to begin favouring rail in medium-distance transport up to 1 500 km, for which subsidies, taxes, and other regulatory mechanisms could be used as needed. An important consideration is that significant internal market demand is noticeable in connection with the modernisation of railroad tracks as well as the manufacturing of rolling stock, both of which could create numerous jobs. In view of check-in and airport transfer times, aeroplanes – in comparison with high-speed trains – provide a zero minimal time benefit while causing considerable carbon dioxide and noise pollution. Even though we cannot prevent volcanic eruptions, we can improve the technology used to predict them and how we evaluate the resulting situation. However, a genuine solution can only be provided by transforming transport, energy and industrial policy, because volcanic eruptions cause either no disruption, or only local disruption, to rail transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each of us in this Chamber was directly affected. Five million of our citizens were stranded with no real alternative form of transport available. One year after that exceptional event, new European measures have so far failed to materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said that a first crisis exercise, linked to volcanic ash, is scheduled for 13 and 14 April under the coordination of Eurocontrol, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but it is essential that the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) exercises real leadership to coordinate safety measures at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certain that the information provided by the Visual Approach Charts (VAC) of London and Toulouse must be refined using more modern technologies. As we saw last April, however, the data may be contradictory and may lead each Member State to take decisions concerning the closure of their air space that are motivated less by information than by emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the role of the EASA is vital in proposing a harmonised interpretation of the data, as well as in ensuring the centralisation and proper dissemination of the information. Beyond the information provided by the VACs, the EASA must put in place a mechanism for collecting the available data in close cooperation with the Member States, the airlines and their pilots.</p>
<p class="contents">This centralisation of information and the coordination of all those involved will prevent the chaos and the inconsistencies we witnessed last year. So I expect the Commission, together with the EASA, to be able to submit specific proposals in the very near future, which will be integrated fully in the implementation of the Single European Sky. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Foster said, many of us realised how dependent we are on modern air travel. Certainly when you come from where I come from, where it is impossible to get to your work unless you use the aeroplane, then that really brings it home to you. Everybody who travelled during that time probably has stories to tell, and some people were very badly affected. In addition, the economic losses airlines and other businesses suffered as a result of grounded flights and stranded passengers were substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">People have said that this could happen again. I think this is what we have got to be prepared for, because there did seem to be an awful lot of indecision. Let me be very honest: as someone who flies every week, when I am up there at 39 000 feet, I want, above all, to be safe and secure, so I do not ever argue about security. We have got to make sure that the safety of the passengers is paramount. I think that is the overlying situation that we should support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not recall a similar paralysis of air traffic in Europe ever happening before. The European Commission, under pressure from public opinion and the aviation industry, announced quick and decisive action as early as April last year. Unfortunately, the volcanic ash has settled, and the Commission’s ambitions have fallen with it. To date, a European crisis management plan for similar situations has not been drafted. It has also not been possible as yet to agree on a common position between safety experts, aircraft manufacturers, airlines and market regulators. It is, therefore, necessary to ask the following questions today: what has been done about this over the last year? If a similar volcanic eruption occurred today, would we react differently than a year ago? When will we be presented with specific measures?</p>
<p class="contents">We are conducting a sustained dialogue on the Single European Sky, on body and liquid scanners, and on procedures for natural disasters such as a volcanic eruption or a severe attack of winter. Meanwhile, air traffic over Europe continues to increase year-on-year. The time for discussions is ending. The European sky needs immediate and good solutions for the future, and I strongly encourage the Commission to complete this work. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question therefore arises as to how we should deal with such situations in the future. It is, of course, first and foremost a question of the safety of those people who board an aeroplane. Of course, we must also keep in mind how we intend to deal with the financial losses. My question to the Commission is therefore – Mr Hahn, perhaps you could also pass this on to Mr Kallas – what, in specific terms, are we planning? I would argue that it is particularly important for us to take over the coordination when it comes to test flights and limit values. That is very important in order for us to know which aeroplanes can take off and when.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another comment, Commissioner: it is extremely important – and this has already been referred to many times – to establish the Single European Sky. What does the Commission intend to do in terms of exerting pressure on the Member States to actually fulfil their obligation in this regard? After all, they have put their signatures to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point, which has already been made several times today, is what happens now with regard to passengers’ rights in air transport. We have Regulation (EC) No 2061 from 2004. What does the Commission intend to do in this regard? We are aware of the problem of the financial losses suffered by the various airlines. I would also like to point out once again that we need alternatives to air transport, and by that I mean the rail system. I am also one of those who believe that we must link the large cities – Europe’s capital cities – together. In this case, too, the answer is that we need more involvement from Europe, not less.</p>

<p class="contents">Almost one year on from the event, we are gathered here to discuss this delicate issue, which caused extensive damage to passengers and businesses involved in both the air sector and, lest we forget, in other industries, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, enhance coordination between the authorities and stakeholders, finally addressing the reform of Eurocontrol, which is not, of course, a body reporting directly to the European institutions, but which was, in any case, crucial in the management and lack of effective management of this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The inadequacy of purely mathematical models, which led the authorities of individual countries to an almost total shutdown of the airspace even when there was no need, has been demonstrated. In the absence of a model tested in the field and more advanced technologies, an excess of caution led to very heavy damage and inconvenience.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must make decisive progress towards achieving the Single European Sky, developing all the functional airspace blocks (FABs) more quickly to reduce fragmentation in the management of airspace and to ensure their more effective management. On the other hand, it is necessary to guarantee the rights of travellers. In this regard, I hope that the Commission can submit its revision of the directive on package travel as soon as possible to clarify the framework of guarantees and liability in extraordinary situations and also any changes to the regulation on passengers’ rights when extraordinary situations are protracted.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be necessary – other fellow Members have said the same – to launch an emergency plan to provide alternative mobility, alternative means of transport if a similar situation should arise again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This accident must prompt us to work towards developing alternative, efficient and competitive modes of transport.

<p class="contents">Seismic and volcanic activity are not a novelty to the world, and other volcanic eruptions are possible in the future. Unfortunately, there is no suitable medicine for such a situation. At such times, the European Union should concentrate on ensuring its citizens alternative means of transport to flying. A good solution, as part of the TEN-T network being set up in the Union, will be the creation of a common network of railway connections and concentrating on improving high-speed rail transport. This would certainly be effective in helping resolve problems of this kind. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been said today, ‘safety first’ must, in future, be the guiding concept when it comes to finding a solution. We need to develop the railways and we need to develop a European rail network. However, we also need a form of overall coordination for passenger and freight transport, irrespective of whether it is by air, rail or road, in the event of earthquakes, ash clouds, floods or similar disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">National contact points, like those we are now setting up in the health sector for cross-border patient care, would seem an almost obvious solution to this – national contact points to which people of all generations can turn. The fact is that I can also see a certain intergenerational inequality at the moment in air transport. It is almost impossible these days to obtain information without the Internet. We should work together to resolve this issue, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over 10 million passengers were directly affected as 100 000 flights were cancelled across Europe. I come from Ireland, and Irish air passengers faced extreme difficulties due to this ash cloud, as Ireland does not have land crossings to mainland Europe. I had to take sea crossings and trains, taxis and cars to get here to Strasbourg, which took me over 24 hours without sleep. Of course, that is a small price to pay; we have to ensure that safety is paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation did, however, highlight the overwhelming need for a common policy. I welcome the recent initiatives by Commissioner Kallas to implement the Single European Sky and to establish functional air space. I also welcome the statement here today by Commission Hahn and I fully support these measures, as volcanic ash clouds recognise no political or geographical boundaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members, you are right that my colleague, Vice-President Siim Kallas, is doing an excellent job and you will receive written answers to your specific questions where necessary. Having said that, I would like to thank you for an interesting debate, particularly as, like you, I was personally affected by events in various ways. Therefore, I would like to conclude by stating the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year’s volcanic ash crisis clearly highlighted the need for us to work together to find solutions to avoid a repeat of the airspace closures we witnessed. That being said – and as was the case in April last year – actions taken in this regard cannot diminish the levels of safety that the aviation industry is renowned for around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Crisis situations are not new to the European Union and the EU response to this crisis was timely and efficient. It showed the importance of centralised European action in a widespread crisis situation. Looking specifically at the Eyjafjallajökull event, the concept, aims and objectives of the Single European Sky initiative have once again been highlighted. As recognised by the Council of Ministers, there is a need to accelerate its implementation to derive all the benefits of its application.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission perspective, the focus remains on ensuring a harmonised approach and application of agreed measures to future crisis situations. This will be of benefit to all citizens in Europe. It is our intention to revise air passenger rights in 2012. Last but not least, the participation of the industry is essential in order to facilitate a coordinated decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the primary responsibility for the safety of flights rests with the operators. Therefore, they must be provided with accurate data. Pilots are trained to manage extraordinary flight conditions, the commercial airlines’ safety manuals are reviewed, overseen and confirmed by regulatory authorities, and airlines have the necessary experience of operating over volcanic areas, as is shown by their safety record. The airline operator (the pilot) should therefore be responsible for assessing the risk and ensuring the safety of flights by, for example, choosing routes or deciding if rerouting is necessary, taking into account all the information available (provision of more information and improved technical equipment on board aircraft). I hope the Commission will liaise with the appropriate authorities to ensure that in the future, they are allowed to get on with their job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent case of the volcanic ash cloud recorded in Iceland in April and May of last year seriously affected the whole of European airspace, during which time 75% of the airport network was inactive, and led to considerable economic losses and affected around 10 million passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent further disruptions to air traffic, there is an urgent need to think of crisis management measures. This means that there needs to be an investment in technological equipment on land and in the air to provide accurate information in real time. In addition, it is vital to define the role and function of the various institutions in crisis management so that there is concerted coordination, to avoid greater losses to the different players. This event shows that it is crucial to develop the integration of European airspace through the Single European Sky initiative. The continual growth of air traffic, the fragmentation of European airspace and unforeseen events such as the volcanic ash cloud show that the EU should coordinate and harmonise its air procedures so as to bring added value to the European air sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Four days ago, the Hungarian Parliament adopted the amendments – all the amendments – requested by the European Commission despite the negative vote, by the way, of Hungarian Socialist and Green Members. Commissioner Kroes was present during the vote and she announced that the amended version of the law was consistent with European law and, in particular, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Yet the resolution of the left-wing groups, which will be put to the vote at midday, completely ignores these facts. The text is virtually the same as that of three weeks ago and makes no mention of the vote of the Hungarian Parliament. My question is this: is this Parliament living in the real, or an imaginary, world? Is this resolution directed against the Hungarian Government or against the European Commission, which no longer has any problem with the law?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would ask the Chair of the Liberal Group: do you, or do you not have confidence in Commissioner Kroes?</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) thinks that this Parliament would lose its credibility if it adopted texts that do not correspond to reality. Must we become a theatre for settling national political scores?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Given these conditions, the PPE Group withdraws its own resolution and calls on the other groups to do the same. The credibility of Parliament is at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our group’s meeting yesterday evening, which I chaired, we discussed the law and the amendments and – like the OSCE and the Council of Europe – we came to the conclusion that these amendments are inadequate.

<p class="contents">The reality of the situation includes those things just mentioned by Mr Swoboda, namely that, in the opinion of both the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the amendments are inadequate. Hungary’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Public Administration and Justice, Mr Navracsics, has himself admitted that this was not a significant amendment of the media law. I could mention the protection of journalistic sources, which still remains unregulated, or the composition and powers of the media authority. All of these are matters that still need to be discussed.</p>

<p class="contents">In the first place, I would like to stress our disappointment over the fact that the Commission decided from the outset to focus on just three areas in relation to the controversial Hungarian media law. We are insistent that, after the Hungarian Government and Parliament had dealt with these three areas in a relatively acceptable way, the Commission should have continued by closely monitoring the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European legislation – specifically, the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to call on the Hungarian authorities, in future amendments to the law, to engage to a greater degree with the parties involved, including civil society, because that is the only way a law can be drawn up in a truly democratic country. In this way, the contributions and recommendations will surely be stimulating, whether ours – those of the European Parliament, the Commission, or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe – or those of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, as we have heard, the Libyan opposition does not want foreign intervention. There are posters up all over Benghazi saying so. Second, the Gaddafi regime <span class="italic">does</span> want foreign intervention: it would justify the dictator’s argument that he is defending his country against foreign invaders. Third, we cannot afford it. The first ship in the area after the humanitarian crisis began was HMS Cumberland from our own country, which was in the area because she was on her way to be scrapped! And our Navy still has more reach than those of most of the other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There might have been an argument for some direct strike against the Gaddafi regime in the 1980s when it was plainly engaged in international terrorism. It is striking that those who are now demanding some form of intervention were not in favour of such action when it would have been justifiable under the norms of international law. There is something disgusting about the spectacle of all these European leaders fawning and slobbering over this appalling regime. We have made quite enough problems for ourselves by our interventions to date. I think we have done quite enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last week in Egypt, four thousand Muslims attacked a Coptic village not far from Cairo. They burned two churches and prevented fire-fighters from entering the village. The army did not want to interfere at first. When they did finally intervene, Muslim representatives sent them away, saying that everything was in order. The 12 000 Christians living in the village were placed under a curfew.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a time when Europe knew who was good, who was bad and why. Thanks to the support of those good people, leaders such as Havel, Walesa and Čarnogurský were prepared for the fall of communism. Today, however, EU politicians are shaking hands with dictators and turning a blind eye to the persecution of Christians. They do not think in terms of good and evil, because pragmatism does not recognise such categories. Until this changes, we may do more harm than good to North Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In voting for the resolution, I express my opposition to Iran’s aggressive foreign policy, and also demand the release of political prisoners, a cessation of the persecution of human rights defenders and a commencement of cooperation with international organisations, including UN bodies.

Like them, it immediately spilled out from behind its borders and sought to replicate itself around the world; like them, it disregarded all established norms of international law, of national sovereignty, of territorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">What was the signature act of the revolution? It was the siege of the US Embassy. Now stop and ponder for a moment how extraordinary that was, given the precedent of relations between countries. Even in the Second World War, when mutually opposed ideologies fought to extirpate each other, diplomats were peaceably evacuated through neutral countries. If the United States were to invade Cuba tomorrow, one assumes that there would be a peaceable exchange of diplomatic personnel. What the Iranians were signalling was that their rules did not match ours; they no longer cared about the idea of state sovereignty and they have carried on as they started, sponsoring their militias from the Silk Road Khanates to the Balkans, even as far afield as Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be in a stronger position to condemn such a regime if we in the European Union gave a little more regard to the principle of national sovereignty and the principle of national self-determination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware of the situation in the Middle East at present. Countries there are witnessing uprisings, in which thousands of innocent people have lost their lives. In this respect, this should have been a resolution on human rights, not on the Middle East. If the aim had been to find a balance here, instead of attempting to blame Israel in this biased way, mention could perhaps have been made of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier who has been deprived of human rights for 1 720 days as a prisoner of the Palestinian Arabs or Hamas.</p>
<p class="contents">When we produce these human rights declarations, we must aim for a balanced, fair approach. That is the only way that they can be taken forward sustainably and which will enable us, furthermore, to retain credibility as guardians of human rights both in Europe and further afield. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Based on these findings, the recommendations of this motion should be adopted, as they concern revising legislation on media based on observations by the Commission, the OSCE and the Council of Europe, and should urge the Commission to draw up a draft directive on the freedom and pluralism of the media by the end of the year in order to address the EU’s inadequate legislative framework, and thus avoid similar situations in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The initiative, announced by Commissioner Kroes, to bring together different stakeholders to form a group of experts, who will then be tasked with tackling the media pluralism situation in Europe, is an important step forward. This group will assist the Commission in outlining new steps for the media landscape. We have been tasked with guaranteeing media pluralism and freedom of the press in Europe.

Furthermore, the European Parliament recalls that the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership, as established in 1993 at the Copenhagen European Council, relating to freedom of the press and freedom of expression should be upheld by all EU Member States and enforced through relevant EU legislation. Thus, the European Parliament calls on the Hungarian authorities to restore the independence of media governance and halt state interference with freedom of expression and balanced coverage. Moreover, I believe that over-regulation of the media is counterproductive, jeopardising effective pluralism in the public sphere. In addition, Parliament calls on the Commission to propose a legislative initiative on media freedom, pluralism and independent governance before the end of the year with a view to defining at least the minimum essential standards and in order to ensure, guarantee and promote an adequate level of media pluralism and independent media governance in the EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The media law in Hungary does deserve criticism, but we have seen that the Hungarian Government was targeted and attacked in a hasty and unfounded manner and this should not have happened, especially at the start of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union. However, I am pleased that the Hungarian Parliament has recently approved amendments to its controversial media law to address points proposed by the European Union, and in doing so, took the wind from the sails of those ideologists inciting tensions. The key requirement that ‘balanced coverage’ would not apply to websites, blogs, debates and foreign newsletters was met. The European Commission should now continually monitor the application of the law. Credit should be given to the constructive dialogue that took place between Hungary and the EU and which resulted in the legislative amendments being approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The foreign media and journalists working in Hungary are no longer threatened by large penalties for violating Hungarian media law, but there are ‘other legal consequences’. However, Hungarian media owners are still subject to penalties, including those which have formally transferred their headquarters to other countries in the EU in order to avoid the media law in Hungary. Although we may disagree with this amendment, it is fully within the competency of the Hungarian Parliament and EU representatives should respect it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A free press is irrefutably a measure of the degree of democracy in a society. In the European Union it is well known that freedom of expression is virtually unrestricted. However, we must not confuse this fundamental right with the freedom to utter any information without consequence or responsibility and without having conclusive proof. This is precisely why clear laws are required, which will set the boundaries within which any journalistic activity needs to operate. The Hungarian press law was drafted in this context, in the wake of the European directive in this area. I also believe that we need to discuss the topic of the Hungarian press law on a fully informed basis, given that we can be misled by biased interests and political disputes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attacking the country that chairs the European Union at a time when it should be supported in the performance of its duties has the effect of weakening the Union as a whole and depriving it of its authority.

The motion’s authors are not as concerned about freedom of the media in Europe as they are of disparaging a civic government that was elected by an overwhelming majority of its country’s people and which has the difficult task of rebuilding a country that suffered badly as a result of mismanagement by the previous socialist government. Even the European Commission was unable to find any serious violations of the freedom of the media in the Hungarian law, which, incidentally, has already been amended. Europe’s left is very quick to see the speck of sawdust in the eye of non-socialist governments, but stupidly pays no attention to the plank in the eyes of socialist governments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to understand the position of the German Liberals, who, with this resolution, are calling for regulation of the media landscape at European level, whereas the German and European media representatives consider this proposal, in particular, to be a restriction of media freedom and an infringement of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recall that the international community has shown complete unanimity in the UN Security Council on the imposition of sanctions on this regime. I strongly support UN Security Council Resolution 1970/2011 and the measures to be taken by the Security Council, including the embargo, banning equipment that is being used for domestic repression and freezing the funds of people involved in human rights abuses, calling attention to the need to implement the EU-Africa Resolution, which allows the freezing of goods that have been acquired illegally. A gesture like this is needed from the European financial institutions and the Member States as part of the ban on mercenary activity. Swift and effective humanitarian action is needed from the EU and the UN.

<p class="contents">According to recent estimates, the political turmoil in North Africa could lead some 300 000 refugees to end up on the southern shores of the Union. I agree with and support, therefore, the appeal launched by six EU Mediterranean Member States for the creation of a Solidarity Fund to help alleviate the effects posed by immigration. I support the creation of a common European asylum system and the fair distribution of costs relating to immigration between Member States. Furthermore, in order to limit mass immigration to Europe, I call for consideration to be given to the sending of humanitarian aid to affected populations, both to support the process of democratisation and economic growth in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to prepare an emergency plan that also considers how we can deal with even the worst-case scenario in which a massive number of immigrants decide to head north to the shores of Europe.

In the case of Libya, the news about the successes and failures of the rebels and the forces that are still supporting Gaddafi's dictatorial regime are contradictory, and they appear to be facing a real civil war. Nevertheless, there are many sources denouncing unprecedented brutal violence and repression led by the Libyan regime, and the large number of victims that this has allegedly caused. The United Nations itself has rightly condemned the atrocities that have been committed. Today, it is clear that the rebels do not want to live under regimes that do not respect their rights and which do not ensure a modicum of respect for the rules of democracy and the rule of law. The European Union cannot alienate itself from what is happening.

First and foremost, the European Parliament expressed its solidarity with the Libyan people and condemned the human rights violations and the violent repression being perpetrated by the Gaddafi regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The no-fly zone is envisaged in paragraph 10 of the resolution and places it within the framework of the UN to prevent the regime from targeting the civilian population in coordination with the Arab League and the African Union. However, this paragraph may be subject to various interpretations. To some, it is simply about preventing the planes of Muammar al-Gaddafi from firing on the civilian population. This interpretation may give it a preventive role going as far as to prevent said planes from assassinating the Libyan population. To others, it is the first step towards possible military intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">I abstained on this ambiguous paragraph.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the adoption of this resolution although I regret that it does not acknowledge the past errors of the Union in its relations with Libya, including on the subject of immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also agree with the Council’s position of a dual approach to the nuclear question: sanctions on the one hand, but offering dialogue on the other.

The policies pursued by the Iranian regime do not respond to the justifiable demands of Iranian citizens. Popular discontent with the Iranian Government as a result of the grave socio-economic situation, combined with a lack of freedom and of basic respect for human dignity within the country, represent the main challenges to the regime’s survival. Furthermore, there continues to be a high number of human rights violations in the country. According to annual reports on the death penalty in Iran, the number of executions in 2009 was the highest for the past 10 years, making Iran the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world. I agree with the report’s call for Iran to abolish definitively the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 and to amend its legislation, which violates the international human rights conventions that Iran has ratified, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and call upon Iran to issue official statistics concerning the application of the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Undoubtedly, however, democratic change cannot be imposed from the outside, but it should be the result of a democratic and peaceful process, finally conceding to calls for welfare and freedom from recent mass Iranian movements. The nuclear question is also still an issue. From our side, the EU should work for a diplomatic solution, based on an approach that combines pressure with ordinary dialogue. It would be advisable, for example, for the European Council to contribute to the freezing of assets of individuals linked to Iran’s nuclear and weapons programmes. In the future, relations between the EU and Iran should, however, focus on analysing the numerous human rights violations.

Electoral fraud, violent repression of demonstrations and executions, which amounted to 680 in 2010 (twice as many as in the previous year) and the arrest of opposition leaders leave no doubts over the use of power and violence by the regime.

The Union must pay greater attention to Iran’s nuclear policy in order to monitor developments in the field of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should support international diplomacy for the protection of human rights. The twin-track approach keeps the door open to dialogue, but it takes at least two to have a dialogue, and in the absence of goodwill on the part of Iran, sanctions should be strengthened and more targeted.

The European Parliament regrets the fact that on several occasions, the UNHRC has been unable to address serious human rights situations in an urgent and timely manner because of the absence of adequate instruments, and actively seeks the creation of dedicated UNHRC mechanisms to respond promptly to the human rights crises in, for example, the Middle East, Iran and Belarus.

It is also well known that it has a narrow and self-serving conception of the declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Once again, in this report, the selective way in which various countries are mentioned is clear. Countries with which the EU maintains economic and diplomatic relations, and to which it attributes strategic importance, have been left out because of the strategic interests they serve, despite their serious violations of human rights. Examples of these countries include Israel, Columbia and Morocco, to name but three, on different continents. For our part, we do not have a restrictive view of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the entire content of the declaration seriously, which we feel, most importantly, inspired our political intervention. Finally, we object to the idea of the European Union having a permanent seat on the United Nations General Assembly for the simple reason that it would not make sense in light of the spirit and principles of the organisation, contained in the United Nations Charter.

Our resolution is particularly significant because we have today remembered the suppression of peaceful protests against the violent occupation of Tibet 52 years ago. The Dalai Lama announced his withdrawal from political life yesterday – this represents an historic loss. There are few people who are held in such high esteem by their own people and the world at large and who, at the same time, are so well liked as His Holiness. By withdrawing from political life, the Dalai Lama is in no way relinquishing his responsibility. He has stated that he continues to be committed to his spiritual role in relation to the concerns of the Tibetan people. His Holiness will transfer the political powers laid down in the Tibetan constitution to the freely elected government-in-exile. In this way, he will once again strengthen the democracy of the exiled Tibetan people, who are spread across all of the continents of the world. On 20 March, a new prime minister and a new parliament will be elected. I will witness the elections in Switzerland as an observer. We Europeans must help to further strengthen democracy and human rights for the Tibetan people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, measures are taken in the name of combating terrorism that are not compatible with human rights. In this regard, the EU also needs to take a look at its own behaviour – for example, in the case of the illegal CIA overflights. Despite these shortcomings, it remains important for the EU in particular to devote itself to the protection of human rights. Protection of the rights of minorities, particularly the improvement of the situation for Christians and other religious minorities in Muslim countries, must be a particular concern of the European Union, with Christians in particular being subjected to severe persecution and being the main victims of religious violence. In view of this, I voted in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The review process is an excellent opportunity to assess how the Council has implemented its mandate. I agree with the proposal that the EU must speak with one voice in relation to issues being dealt with. Furthermore, the Member States must actively engage in reviewing the Council’s work. I welcome the fact that on the agenda of the 16th regular session are reports on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, on the rights of the child, and on countering terrorism. However, in order to improve human living conditions, issues relating to the right to water and sanitation should be considered at the session. We must guarantee an effective mechanism to implement and protect what is a fundamental human right. Every effort must be made to ensure that commitments in this area are implemented internationally and every person has access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In May 2010, we talked about this subject here in Strasbourg in the company of the Minister for Minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti. Today in Parliament, we are debating the circumstances of his death. The murder of a high-ranking state official, which took place on 2 March, means only one thing: in Pakistan, no one is safe from the radical Islamists. In danger are not only those who criticise the archaic law which prescribes a sentence of death for religious blasphemy, but also those who publicly stand up for the victims of intolerance, such as Mr Bhatti.</p>
<p class="contents">After 10 months, it can be seen that current European Union policy towards Pakistan is not bringing the intended effects. Therefore, I support the idea contained in our resolution of holding round-table meetings on the situation of minorities in Pakistan. I think the newly created European External Action Service must react clearly to events in Islamabad before more people become victims and before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He had only held office for six months when the Pakistani Parliament adopted a significant reform that guaranteed a 5% quota to the country’s minorities in public positions. That was just one of the numerous democratic reforms which Bhatti pushed forward and of which the Pakistani Government should be very proud.</p>
<p class="contents">Most significant of all is perhaps the ‘Interfaith Harmony Dialogue’, which he began at local level, and which aimed to diffuse tensions and tackle the problems that give rise to terrorism. I saw in the idea the ingredients for the Nobel Peace Prize and I hope that the work to promote human rights and democracy in Pakistan will not cease, even though extremist elements gained a temporary victory when they disposed of the country’s most strategic human rights activist. If dialogue succeeds in a country which is a centre of radical Islam, the positive effects will radiate everywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Only about a month ago, I met Mr Bhatti. We talked about his possible death. He was not naïve. He understood very well what bravery could lead to. I will die before too long, he said, but meanwhile I will try to change unjust legislation as much as I can. I will die, but the law will remain and it will affect the lives of millions.</p>

Attack after attack seems to be taking place and the government seems to have lost the will to intervene. Last January, Governor Taseer was assassinated, and last week, the only Christian federal minister, Mr Bhatti, was assassinated, too. The European Union and Member States are maintaining contacts with Pakistan in many ways. Cooperation is afoot as regards Afghanistan, many hundreds of millions in aid are pouring into the country for education and reconstruction and efforts are being made to foster interfaith dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the time has come for us to put our foot down. The Pakistani education system must be reformed and the preaching of hatred for Christians to young children must be stopped. The aid for reconstruction after the flooding should be distributed fairly, and that includes to non-Muslims. That is not only in the interests of the West. If the Pakistani Government and the security services do not get the situation under control, the country will sink into the morass of extremism. There is very little time left to reverse that tide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to say to the defenders of tolerance in Pakistan and to the defenders of religious freedom in Pakistan that they are not alone. This is a very modest aim, but I believe that it is a first step towards some dignity and respect in the debate, and this message will reach those in Pakistan supporting religious freedom, so the first thing I should like to do is tell them that they are not alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I should like to do is make it very clear to the Pakistani Government that it cannot stop the extremists in Pakistan from thinking that they speak on behalf of everyone because this is the vicious circle countries often fall into when it comes to blasphemy laws, as is the case now in Pakistan, or as was the case, for example, in Indonesia. We are dealing with a minority of very vocal extremists who speak very loudly and who eventually start to believe that they are speaking on behalf of everyone because they manage to intimidate the rest of society. Consequently, in this case, if governments are not first in line to defend freedom in their own countries and fight against impunity, and if governments do not impose a bastion of dignity, the whole country will run the risk of being plagued by intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pakistani Government must therefore fully investigate Shahbaz Bhatti’s murder and must carry out investigations until conclusions have been reached as it did in the case of the Governor of Punjab. What it certainly cannot do is allow the investigations to be corrupted by the kind of practices the police and the Pakistani secret services have been using in investigations, which have destroyed investigations, including even those relating to the murder of the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto. It is therefore vital that the Pakistani Government ensures that the extremists do not take charge of public discourse and, for our part, that we maintain our solidarity with the defenders of tolerance in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With this resolution, we want to applaud and thank Shahbaz Bhatti for the example he has set us over the years. I hope so painful a sacrifice serves as a warning to the governments of the European Union and to the High Representative for Foreign Policy so that specific actions can replace the few words that have been spoken with such a lack of force to date.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in recent months, the European Union, or rather the Council and the Commission, unlike Parliament, have wasted time discussing whether or not they should include the word ‘Christian’ in their weak condemnations, while Christians continue to be brutally slaughtered, often because they approached the West, even though there is nothing western about them.

Paragraph 13 about calling on the competent EU institutions to include the issue of religious tolerance in society is vitally important.

Unfortunately, the citizens of Pakistan and the families of the victims cannot expect much from a judicial system that is blighted by corruption, intimidation and poorly-trained investigators and prosecutors. Investigations take years and are based on discriminatory laws. The criminal dimension of the judicial system, in particular, needs to be reformed and gain real credibility both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a poll carried out in universities by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, young Pakistanis believe that the credibility of the judicial system is more crucial for the survival of the country than military force or the parliamentary system.</p>

<p class="contents">Vice-President Ashton strongly condemned the murder and expressed deep concern over the climate of intolerance and violence in Pakistan linked to the debate over the controversial blasphemy laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bhatti was the only Christian in the government of Pakistan and a well-known advocate of respect for human rights and religious freedom. He was one of the few voices left who dared to speak out and knew he was under threat after the murder of Salman Taseer. Yet this did not stop him from defending his rights which, after all, are enshrined in the Pakistani constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Ashton has called on the government of Pakistan to take its responsibilities and provide adequate protection for those in official functions or in civil society who are threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU welcomes Prime Minister Jamali’s declaration that the government will do its utmost to bring the culprits to justice. Our respect goes to Mr Jamali for attending Mr Bhatti’s funeral.</p>
<p class="contents">The government must now live up to its commitments and bring to justice the perpetrators and instigators of such crimes. Mr Bhatti and Mr Taseer were outspoken critics of the blasphemy laws and at the forefront of efforts to amend them. However, in the climate prevailing after the Taseer murder, the amendments were withdrawn from parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The blasphemy laws, which carry the death penalty, are incompatible with the common values we seek to promote in our relations with Pakistan. They have also led to miscarriages of justice and discrimination against religious minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">While we strongly support Pakistan’s democratic government and will do what we can to assist it as it seeks to cope with an unprecedented wave of terrorist acts, its members should stand up for the principles they subscribe to. Freedom of religion or belief is a universal human right; freedom of opinion and expression is intrinsically linked to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has just adopted conclusions recalling the commitment of the EU to safeguard these fundamental rights and to step up efforts to promote and protect these rights everywhere and for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope the perpetrators of this crime will quickly be apprehended and duly punished. This brutal incident, the victim of which was a high-ranking state official fighting for equal rights for minorities in Pakistan, is further evidence of how difficult the situation is in that country. Unfortunately, our current policy has not brought the expected results. In view of this, the European Union must take specific steps which will help to increase respect for the letter of the law and democracy in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a significant intensification of our work, by organising and holding annual EU-Pakistan meetings on the situation of minorities in Pakistan with the involvement of the European Parliament, can bring tangible benefits. In accordance with the text of the resolution we have adopted today, I fully endorse the financial support being given on our part to organisations which defend human rights and which are fighting the blasphemy laws. I hope we will be able to increase the scale of that support. I hope, too, that we will be able, with the help of suitable diplomatic instruments, to persuade the government of Pakistan to respect the provisions enshrined in the democracy and human rights clause of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject of discussion was the same as the one we are talking about today – attempts at reforming the controversial blasphemy legislation. The two tragic events are closely related to each other, because the victims had worked together on behalf of national minorities in Pakistan, including religious minorities, and in defence of those who have fallen victim to the ideology of intolerance spread by the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Western world can only look on at the advancing radicalisation of attitudes in the country, where not even a decade ago, Benazir Bhutto was introducing democratic reforms. Pakistan is sinking into chaos – the Taliban are terrorising the country and with increasing frequency are carrying out attacks like the one which took place in Punjab on 8 March, for example, in which 25 people were killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports have now appeared of the next person whom the extremists have sentenced to death – Member of the Pakistani Parliament, former journalist and defender of women’s rights, religious minorities and freedom of speech, Sherry Rehman. It was she who submitted to the Pakistani Parliament a draft of amendments to legislation on punishments for blasphemy. At the next part-session, will we be condemning an attack made on her? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents">Freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of movement in countries such as Belarus should be a priority, and it is therefore necessary to call for the immediate and unconditional release of these people, who cannot be called anything other than political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it is also important to condemn – and this is what the resolution does – the use of torture in these countries, as in others, in the strongest, toughest, clearest and firmest way possible, even when this occurs in the European Union, which, unfortunately, is sometimes the case. However, in a country with which our neighbourly relations are continuing to grow, and with which we are strengthening our relationship, the use of torture as a form of treatment in prisons, especially when it is fuelled by political motivation, is something that demands our total rejection and full condemnation</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to openly condemn the sentence imposed on the young opposition activist simply for having taken part in the demonstrations on 19 September 2010. I think Parliament is right to position itself clearly against these options, and I insist that its voice must be heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After a year of very modest progress, 19 December 2010 became a turning point for Belarus. Since then, the country has been falling into self-isolation: this can save the regime for some time, but it is at the expense of the future of the Belarusian nation. This has to be understood, and we will not stop reminding Lukashenko and his friends of it. I hope that President Lukashenko will take good note of the events in the southern neighbourhood and understand that the only responsible behaviour is democratisation and the social and economic reforms in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament will not give up; we call for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained protestors and for the dropping of all politically motivated charges. At the same time, we still believe that Belarus has time to change; we are working together with the other five eastern neighbours to find a solution leading to democratisation and to the creation of a situation in Belarus where free and fair elections can take place at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our resolution is an expression of our shock and outrage, and of our solidarity with those who are being persecuted. Today, I would like, from here, to send three messages. The first message is to Ales Mikhalevich, but also to Anatoli Labiedzka and Mikhail Statkievich, who are in prison: we admire your courage; we are with you and we will not desert you.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message is to Alexander Lukashenko: start showing respect for the international conventions your country has ratified, including the Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership, and stop persecuting your citizens.</p>

It is as if Belarus were inhabited by people who are guided by different standards. However, this is not the case. There are also Europeans living there – people who want to feel they live in a common Europe. The problem is the president of the country, who makes use of methods known from the Soviet Union of several decades ago – what President Lukashenko offers us is a singular journey into the past. Unlike Mr Vigenin, who spoke a moment ago, I think we should believe in our European voice and that Parliament and the European Union can put pressure on the Belarusian authorities so that they will respect human rights. This is a question not so much of policy but of fundamental morals and ethics. We should say to our Belarusian brothers today that they are not alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given that we have managed to discuss the problems we are facing within the European Union in a vote that divided this House and split it in two, and which has given us a lot of work over the past two months, we can now confront President Lukashenko of Belarus with our heads held high. We can tell President Lukashenko that he must stop his repression of demonstrations, his repression of opponents and his repression of the press in his own country, because he himself represents a government that thinks it has a monopoly on the right to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is balanced, what is neutral and what is objective, not only in its own assertions, but also in those of the opposition and those of the foreign press. We even saw President Lukashenko confronting the international media with profound arrogance, following the repression of the demonstrations in December.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe we can have hope that the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of the Commission and the voice of the Council will be heard in Belarus, and that we will achieve a moral authority, beyond that which we also need to preserve through our example in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the same day, Ales Mikhalevich celebrated his 53rd birthday in prison. The simple reason for this is that he is a free man, a man who dared to enter the presidential contest and, in a dictatorship like Belarus, the penalty for making such gestures of freedom is to have one’s movements restricted and get sent to prison. I would like to highlight two points in our resolution which I regard as extremely important. I feel that we need to support the extension of the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union by producing a list which includes the prosecutors, judges and members of the secret police involved in the recent human rights violations in Belarus.

<p class="contents">Human rights were dealt a heavy blow at the time of the presidential elections in December 2010. The demonstrations organised by the opposition against election fraud were mercilessly crushed by the security forces. Those arrested include one of the presidential candidates, Ales Mikhalevich. He publicised the torture he was subjected to in prison, a fact, however, which has been denied by the authorities. Journalists close to the opposition were also targeted at the same time. In spite of the ban on making statements, they confirmed Mikhalevich’s assertions in the hope of attracting the EU’s attention to the critical situation in Belarus. The circumstances under which the arrests were made are vague, but the treatment they state they were subjected to amounts to serious human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, he remains the archetypal <span class="italic">homo sovieticus</span>, a strong man whose addiction to power is as strong as his instincts for crushing dissent.</p>
<p class="contents">Lukashenko used the KGB, or uses the KGB, as a political tool to silence the popular protest, including the cases of Ales Mikhalevich and Natalia Radina, that followed yet another disappointingly rigged presidential election in December last year. More than 700 people were arrested. Stories abound of opposition activists being abducted, detained extrajudicially, and then tortured mentally and psychologically by the KGB.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus matters to us so much because it is a European country and has become a Cuba on our own doorstep. If the EU is to have any moral force in the world with regard to promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law, it must surely start in Europe itself, our own continent. I do not dispute the need to engage with the Lukashenko regime. An empty chair policy would be counter-productive with the EU, but we need to increase support to the opposition in Belarus and tighten EU smart sanctions on Lukashenko and his KGB cronies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The arrests of the supporters of the opposition in December reflect the way in which an attempt is being made to silence Lukashenko’s opponents using violent means.</p>
<p class="contents">The imprisonment of Ales Mikhalevich and six other opposition presidential candidates on the unjustifiable pretext that they had provoked violent demonstrations contravenes political rights. Similarly, the imprisonment of journalist, Natalia Radina, for more than a month makes the likelihood of free expression of opinion in Belarus an even more distant reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take seriously the accusations of inhumane treatment and torture in KGB prisons made by Mikhalevich, Radina and others, and these should be investigated by an impartial body. I want to remind Belarus of the international commitments it made by ratifying the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture, and, as a consequence, the responsibility it has towards the international community and, in particular, its own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The widespread detention and prosecution of civil society activists, including presidential candidates, in the post-election period led us to expect harsh sentences to follow. As of today, we already know of four cases where individuals have been sentenced to several years in prison. We fear that many more such sentences, involving up to 40 people who now stand accused, will follow in months to come. What is more, we have been appalled by reports of the torture and ill-treatment of people detained on political grounds, including ex-presidential candidate Mikhalevich.</p>
<p class="contents">All these despicable events may call for an update of our EU response. The situation today is as follows: as you know, the EU reacted to the fraudulent elections of 19 December and to the subsequent repression by putting nearly 160 people on a sanction list. This was a very clear and strong message of condemnation to the authorities. At the same time, the Commission and the European External Action Service have swiftly designed new dedicated assistance tools to provide urgent support to the victims of repression, their families and civil society, up to an amount of EUR 1.7 million. This assistance is being delivered with the initial focus on providing legal assistance and counselling to victims of repression and on support to civil society organisations and civic campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also finalising a re-orientation of our mid-term assistance to Belarus to increase support to civil society. The Commission is quadrupling its aid to Belarusian civil society for the period 2011-2013 to a total of EUR 15.6 million, with particular attention given to strengthening independent media and supporting students, including by maintaining funding for the European Humanities University.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time to reflect on whether an additional response is needed. The High Representative issued an immediate condemnation following the first sentence on 18 February, and she recalled that political motives had no place in a legal process. The EU also strongly condemned the harsh sentences and torture allegations at the OSCE and is discussing the matter at the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union will discuss whether the latest events call for a further expansion of our existing sanction list to add new names such as those responsible for issuing the latest sentences and leading the recent crackdown. The EU stands ready to consider further targeted measures in all areas of cooperation as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s resolution will certainly be a useful and timely contribution to our reflections and discussions. I thank Members for their attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the coming months, we should watch the development of the political situation there carefully. Today, however, we are talking about another minority group which is suffering discrimination in China – the Muslim Uyghur population. China is justifying its policy towards them by the need to fight terrorism, and for the Chinese authorities, the persecution of the Uyghur people also means the destruction of the Uyghurs’ cultural heritage. Particularly disturbing are the reports of the reconstruction of the city of Kashgar. This will, in practice, mean the destruction of its historical centre, one of the most interesting and best-preserved examples of Muslim architecture in Central Asia, which attracts more than a million tourists every year and would be eligible for inclusion on the UNESCO world heritage list if China applied for this status.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the European Union’s diplomatic service will demonstrate its effectiveness in talks with the Chinese authorities, and will remind them of the need to respect the rights of ethnic minorities and protect their cultural heritage.

On 27 January, I organised a conference in Brussels, where I learned of the impact which the destructive Chinese urbanisation plans are having on the Uyghur population. It is, indeed, the case that, under the guise of public security and modernisation, China wants to leave no more than 15% of the original city intact and, in fact, transform Kashgar into one huge open-air museum. I think it is high time that we responded powerfully to this, before it is too late.</p>
<p class="contents">After quashing the demonstrations in Urumqi in July 2009, the Chinese authorities were called upon by this House to make every effort to bring about an open, permanent and respectful dialogue with the Uyghurs and pursue a more integrated and comprehensive economic policy in their area, aimed at encouraging local involvement and, above all, protecting Uyghur cultural identity. Unfortunately, the current Chinese policy in Kashgar is proving to be quite the reverse of what was called for then. Not only the destruction of Kashgar, while denying the local population any say in the matter, but also the Chinese refusal to allow Kashgar to compete for UNESCO world heritage status, is illustrative of the way in which the Chinese Communist Party deals with cultural diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, such a sentiment does not resonate in the People’s Republic of China, whose Communist rulers are obsessed with unity, but not much thought is given to celebrating diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the attempt to impose Han Chinese majority culture on tiny minorities in the world’s most populous country is causing much tension and resentment. We already know about the suppression of the ancient Buddhist Tibetan culture over the last 60 years; now we see the same threat looming over the city of Kashgar in the restive province of Xinjiang.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2 000 years, Kashgar has been a thriving city on the Silk Road with a rich, unique and flourishing central Asian culture, but now it is facing wholesale demolition and rebuilding. It is hard to escape the idea that this is Beijing’s attempt to break the will of the Uyghur separatists.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally have no brief or sympathy for the separatist cause, some of whose supporters, I am afraid, have links to al-Qaeda, but I urge the Chinese Government to think again.

We have talked about Pakistan and Belarus and we then have reason to believe that the European Union has not only moral authority but also leverage or power over external authorities to try to ensure, at least, that they are on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, when we talk about China, we know that this leverage is reduced because a lot of what we say in this House contradicts what the European governments in our capitals do: that is to say, what Mr Sarkozy, Mrs Merkel or politicians in my own country, Portugal, do, like Mr Sócrates, who only very recently diverted a demonstration against Chinese authorities so that the Premier, who was visiting Lisbon, did not have to come face to face with those protesting against his regime. In other words, it is Europe itself that is repeatedly participating in this dream world or fantasy world, which the Chinese leaders are creating for themselves, in which there is no opposition and in which one development model suits all, and is the same in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or in Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is really difficult for the European Parliament to say what we are going to say today, which is also what is written in our resolution: we are calling for the Beijing authorities to stop committing this demographic genocide against Uyghurs; we are calling for them to preserve the cultural and ethnic diversity of the regions that make up China; and we are calling for them to preserve places of architectural or heritage value. However, the leaders of our own countries are throwing themselves into the arms of the Chinese leaders, pardoning them for everything that they have done in their country, and are giving them free rein in the name of a development model that ultimately we respect only to a very basic degree. It has therefore been demonstrated once again that moral authority begins to take shape at home and that, in any case, when we in the European Union are talking about others, we are, first and foremost, talking about ourselves, and we need to review our attitude towards China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Uyghurs are supported, in particular, by the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich, and the cultural heritage of Kashgar is supported by the Blue Shield movement, the president of which, Karl von Habsburg, was here in Strasbourg this week to provide us with information.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to support the Uyghurs, let us do so by means of a friendly appeal to the Chinese, because the Uyghurs are threatened with cultural ethnocide. Moreover, China, as the oldest cultural nation in the world, should clearly recognise that one of the characteristics of a cultural people is the protection of, and respect for, other cultures, particularly when it comes to small cultures in a huge empire. The Chinese only have to apply their own constitution, which states in three places that this cultural heritage must be preserved.</p>

<p class="contents">Kashgar is the centre of the Muslim Uyghurs – one of the largest ethnic minorities in China. For millennia, the Chinese tried to subdue the lands of the Uyghurs, and many times they failed in their fight to subdue these lands.

The policy being pursued of so-called urban reconstruction is resulting in the gradual disappearance of this group’s identity, which developed its culture around the fortress situated on the Silk Road. I believe that moving the Uyghur population from their traditional dwellings and demolishing Kashgar are measures which violate minorities’ rights. In addition, the city is regarded as the best preserved example of Islamic architecture in Central Asia. Kashgar’s streets and buildings can be restored to improve the inhabitants’ living conditions. The question is why the authorities are not investing in activities of this kind. I recommend the inclusion of the old centre in the UNESCO world heritage list as part of the Silk Road.

Moreover, the destruction of important cultural property has the potential to deal a serious blow, not only to the heritage and archaeological patrimony of the minority concerned, but to cultural heritage in general. In this light, the European Union is following with concern the redevelopment of the ancient city of Kashgar in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China. The significance of Kashgar as a centre of culture for the Uyghur minority in China cannot be overstated. Kashgar is conceived as being as important as Jerusalem is to Jews, Muslims and Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese Government’s 2009 White Paper on Xinjiang stated that restoration of Kashgar is necessary to protect the city from earthquakes or fire. This is a laudable aim. Civil society, both in China and internationally, has expressed considerable disquiet about the methods employed. There is serious concern that as much as 85% of the old city may be demolished. Indeed, many notable buildings, including the unique Xanliq madrasah, appear to have been destroyed already. It is also worrying that some 200 000 people may be displaced from their traditional homes and that there appears to have been little or no consultation with the residents affected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is feared that the demolition of structures which have formed the basis of Uyghur culture for many hundreds of years may have a grave impact on the preservation of their culture in the years ahead. It is also regrettable that China has chosen not to propose Kashgar as a world heritage site despite its unique status, as this would allow UNESCO to become involved in the process of redevelopment. We understand that UNESCO has, in any event, made representations to the Chinese authorities concerning the impact of the development on Kashgar’s traditional heritage and culture. The European Union fully shares these concerns and will call on the Chinese authorities to work with UNESCO to ensure that any redevelopment of Kashgar meets international best practice in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will also call on the Chinese authorities to ensure that the inhabitants of Kashgar are fully consulted about the future of the city and that their views are taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Honourable Members, I would like to thank you for putting this question, which is of particular interest to the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p>As you rightly pointed out, the Hungarian Presidency has put forward a number of activities in the area of family policy under the heading ‘Demographic Change and Family Policy’. These include an initiative on a European Year of Families to take place in 2014, building on the results of the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010). The Presidency strongly believes that special attention needs to be devoted to families. Improving the social situation of families could have a positive influence on the current demographic tendencies, and will most certainly contribute to strengthening social cohesion.</p>
<p>As far as the impact of the crisis on the social situation of families is concerned, the Presidency has studied with interest the information available on family policies, in particular, through various reports prepared by the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission. In order to deepen knowledge on these issues, the Hungarian Presidency will organise on 28-29 March an experts conference on ‘The Impact of Work and Family Reconciliation on Demographic Dynamics’ and on 1 April, the Presidency will host an informal meeting of ministers responsible for family and demographic affairs. Issues related to families and the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as possibilities for enhancing cooperation in the field of family policies, will be addressed. It is within this framework of actions addressing the demographic challenge that the Hungarian Presidency is preparing the initiative on a ‘European Year of Families 2014’.</p>
<p>Whilst family issues are, first and foremost, an area of Member States’ competence, family policies are firmly embedded in our shared values and traditions, and there is considerable scope for cooperation at EU level. Actions such as those proposed by the Hungarian Presidency can also provide added value to policy options and solutions at national level. The Presidency hopes that its initiative on a ‘European Year of Families 2014’ will secure wide support. Of course, detailed objectives and measures of the European Year of Families will have to be discussed and decided upon at a later stage.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000062"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Direct taxation remains primarily within the competence of the Member States. Nonetheless, in a few cases corporate taxation has been subject to EU legislation and coordination where this was necessary for the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p>Concerning EU legislation, the Council has adopted directives on cross-border income flows (Directive 90/435/EEC<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning parent companies and subsidiaries and Directive 2003/49/EC<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning interest and royalty payments) and on cross-border merging of international groups of companies (Directive 90/434/EEC of 23 July 1990<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on mergers). It also adopted Directive 77/799/EEC<a href="#defann_2_4" name="refann_2_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on mutual assistance.</p>
<p>As far as coordination is concerned, since 1998, the Council Code of Conduct Group meets regularly to assess potentially harmful measures in the area of business taxation. As a result, a significant number of harmful tax measures have been identified and rolled back. Lastly, in June 2010, the Council adopted a resolution on coordination of the Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) and thin capitalisation rules within the European Union, which is also aimed at coordinating Member States’ policies in the area of direct taxation.</p>
<p>As regards future work in the area of corporate taxation, the Commission, in its Work Programme for 2011, is planning to submit a proposal on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, on which the European Parliament will be consulted.</p>
<p>Against this background, any ideas on corporate tax rates are only being floated by a couple of Member States. Pursuant to the Treaty, EU legislation measures in the tax area require a proposal from the Commission and unanimity within the Council, which can adopt directives after consulting the European Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The European Council of 16-17 December 2010 decided that the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU should be modified in order to recognise the power of the euro area Member States to create a permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard financial stability in the euro area. It further mandated the Finance Ministers of the euro area Member States and the Commission to finalise work on the intergovernmental arrangement setting up the future European Stability Mechanism by March 2011. As this work is intergovernmental, it falls outside the competence of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p>As for the so-called ‘European semester’, this was endorsed by the Council in its conclusions on 7 September 2010, and involves simultaneous monitoring of the Member States’ budgetary policies and structural reforms, in accordance with common rules, during a six-month period every year. The European semester is being implemented for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Member States had already submitted their draft National Reform Programmes in 2010, while the Commission presented to the Council the main conclusions of its first Annual Growth Survey on 13 January 2011<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This survey outlines priority actions to be taken by Member States and sets out priorities in three main areas, namely, the enhancing of macro-economic stability, structural reforms for boosting employment and growth-enhancing measures under the ‘Europe 2020’ strategy.</p>
<p>On 18 January 2011, the Council held a review of draft National Reform Programmes and had an exchange of views on the Annual Growth Survey submitted by the Commission.</p>
<p>On 15 February, the Council adopted conclusions on macro-economic and fiscal guidance.</p>
<p>In line with the road map set out by the Hungarian Presidency, on 28 February, the Council gave its reaction to the Annual Growth Survey presented by the Commission and is expected to discuss the Joint Employment Report on 7 March, the Research and Development Target on 10-11 March, and climate change on 14 March. On 21 March, the Council will be invited by the Presidency to endorse a Synthesis Report setting out the main messages based on the work carried out in the relevant Council formations, with a view to its transmission to the European Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the Member States’ budgets, the Council agreed, on 15 February, on strict compliance with the Council recommendations in the context of the excessive deficit procedure. Member States facing very large structural budget deficits or very high or rapidly increasing public debt levels should frontload their fiscal consolidation. Furthermore, all Member States should keep the growth of expenditure net of discretionary revenue measures clearly below the medium-term rate of potential GDP growth until they have reached their medium-term budgetary objective. At the same time, they should prioritise sustainable growth-friendly expenditure and promote efficiency of public spending.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) In its conclusions of 14 December 2010, the Council reaffirmed its unequivocal commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkans, a prospect which had already been reconfirmed at the High Level Meeting on the Western Balkans in Sarajevo on 2 June 2010 and which remains essential for the stability, reconciliation and future of the region. At the same time, the Council reaffirmed the need for fair and rigorous conditionality, in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process, and in accordance with the renewed consensus on enlargement approved by the European Council on 14 and 15 December 2006.</p>
<p>The Council recalled that by making solid progress in economic and political reform, and by fulfilling the necessary conditions and requirements, the remaining potential candidates in the Western Balkans should achieve candidate status, according to their own merits, with European Union membership as the ultimate goal. A country’s satisfactory track record in implementing its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, including trade-related provisions, is an essential element for the EU to consider any membership application.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the progress achieved by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in key reform areas such as police reform, albeit at an uneven pace. The country continues to fulfil its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. The Council expects momentum of the reform agenda to be maintained. Further progress still needs to be made on issues such as dialogue among political actors, judiciary and public administration reform, the fight against corruption, freedom of expression and improving the business environment. The implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement remains an essential element of democracy and the rule of law in the country.</p>
<p>The Council broadly shares the Commission's assessment of the country’s sufficient fulfilment of the political criteria and noted that the Commission reiterated its recommendation that accession negotiations should be opened with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Council stated in its conclusions its readiness to return to the matter during the Hungarian Presidency. The Council reiterated that maintaining good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the UN, is essential.

<p>(EN) With respect to developments in Egypt and Tunisia to which the honourable Member of the European Parliament refers in his question, the European Council, the Council (FAC) as well as the Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission and the High Representative, in a joint statement, saluted the peaceful and dignified expression by the Tunisian and Egyptian people of their legitimate, democratic, economic and social aspirations which are in accordance with the values the European Union promotes for itself and throughout the world. It was emphasised that the citizens’ democratic aspirations should be addressed through dialogue and political reform, with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and through free and fair elections.</p>

In this context, the European Council invited the High Representative to develop a package of measures aimed at lending European Union support to the transition and transformation processes (strengthening democratic institutions, promoting democratic governance and social justice, and assisting the preparation and conduct of free and fair elections); and to link the European Neighbourhood Policy and Union for the Mediterranean more to these objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000074"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) In June 2010, the Council adopted conclusions on the interim joint report on pensions prepared by the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and the Social Protection Committee (SPC). In these conclusions, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to the common objectives of sustainable and adequate pensions and to the three-pronged strategy for meeting the economic and budgetary consequences of ageing. This aims namely at reducing debt at a faster pace, raising employment rates and productivity, and reforming pension, healthcare and long-term care systems.</p>
<p>Following the Commission Green Paper and the finalisation of the EPC-SPC joint report, the Council discussed the issue on 17 November 2010 and underlined the long-term challenge of ageing populations for the sustainability and adequacy of pensions, as aggravated by the current economic situation. The EPSCO Council meeting in December adopted Council conclusions in this context.</p>
<p>Development of the pension systems is a long-term issue. Consequently, this must be constantly kept on the agenda now and in the future as well. That is why the EPSCO Council at its meeting of 7 March discussed the preliminary conclusions of the Green Paper’s consultation on the adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems The Council held a fruitful exchange of views on the most pressing dilemmas of European pension systems. The main issues were, besides the retirement age, the inter-related problematics of adequacy, sustainability and security, together with the special conditions shaped by the impact of the budgetary constraints. The main conclusion of the debate was that while most Member States deemed necessary the further strengthening of the coordination on EU level in the field of the pension systems, at the same time, they nailed down that pensions and retirements age are matters of exclusive Member States’ competence.</p>
<p>The Council stressed the urgency for further implementation of structural reforms, consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy, in order to support fiscal consolidation, improve growth prospects, strengthen work incentives, ensure flexible labour markets and extend working lives.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Hungarian Presidency of the Council attaches great importance to the protection of victims of crime, which is also set out in the Stockholm Programme (‘An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens’) as a key objective for the Union. Indeed, in this programme, the European Council has stressed the importance of providing special support and legal protection to those who are most vulnerable or who find themselves in particularly exposed situations, such as persons subjected to repeated violence in close relationships, victims of gender based violence, or persons who fall victim to other types of crimes in a Member State of which they are not nationals or residents. The Presidency stresses that an integrated and coordinated approach to victims is needed, in line with the Stockholm Programme and the Council conclusions on a strategy to ensure fulfilment of the rights of persons who fall victims of crime and to improve support for them, adopted in October 2009.</p>
<p>In preparation of such an integrated approach, the Presidency will organise a comprehensive seminar, scheduled for 23-24 March 2011 in Budapest, under the title ‘Protecting victims in the EU: The road ahead’, where a wide range of issues will be discussed concerning the future legislative and non-legislative initiatives in this field.</p>
<p>The Council also awaits the presentation of the Commission’s package of measures on the protection of victims, especially in the context of criminal proceedings, at the Justice Council on 12 April 2011. Once this set of proposals will have been formally tabled, the Council will examine it as a matter of priority, and draw up a comprehensive list of action points which the Member States undertake to act upon in order to fulfil their commitment in the Stockholm Programme to enhance victims’ protection in the EU. This list will be centred around the upcoming Commission proposals, in particular, concerning the revision of Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA of 15 March 2001 on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, but will also look beyond that. The Presidency plans to include these action points in a Council ‘road map’, to ensure the coherence of future initiatives in this field, both through legislative and non-legislative measures. The Presidency plans to have the road map adopted at the Justice Council on 10 June 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000083"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council is committed to the protection of human health and the environment from releases of mercury and its compounds and is conscious of the concern that the honourable Member raises in his question. At present, the Council examines the review of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury on the basis of the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of 7 December 2010<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The review, under Action 8, describes in detail actions and measures addressing the mercury content used in energy efficient light bulbs, which were introduced at EU level following the progressive ban of incandescent bulbs from the EU market by the 2005 Eco-design Directive, as amended in 2009. The review refers also to the Opinion on Mercury in Certain Energy-saving Light Bulbs of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) which concludes that a human health risk for adults due to breakage of such lamps is unlikely. The Council is, for the moment, not aware of any other study stating the opposite.</p>
<p>However, the Council considers important that Member States and the Commission continue to study and to raise awareness of all stakeholders, including the general public, on the health and environmental impact of mercury, and to disseminate information about the ongoing EU activities in this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Commission’s communication on the Mid-term revision of the Small Business Act of 23 February 2011 contains measures to reduce administrative burden, dismantle barriers to effective cross-border operations within the Single Market, facilitate SME business in the global market, and improve access to finance for SMEs. The Presidency intends to focus on this Communication and submit draft conclusions for adoption to the Council in May 2011 on issues such as:</p>
<p>the application of the ‘only once’ principle, avoiding to ask SMEs the same questions by public authorities several times,</p>
<p>reducing ‘gold plating’ by Member States in line with ‘smart regulation’ principles,</p>
<p>systematically assessing the impact of legislation using an ‘SME test’,</p>
<p>presenting at a defined moment each year a forward planning of business-related legislation,</p>
<p>applying the ‘think small first’ principle also to administrative procedures affecting SMEs.</p>
<p>Existing actions will also be further developed in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, in the following areas:</p>
<p>making smart regulation a reality for European SMEs,</p>
<p>taking a broad-based approach to enhancing market access to SMEs,</p>
<p>helping SMEs to contribute to a resource-efficient economy, and</p>
<p>promoting entrepreneurship, job creation and inclusive growth.</p>
<p>As for access to finance, a number of instruments introduced by Member States for ensuring easier and more equitable access to bank lending already proved to be effective.</p>
<p>At EU level, the financial instruments of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), with a total budget of EUR 1.1 billion for the period 2007-2013, enable financial institutions to provide about EUR 30 billion. In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB) almost doubled its lending for small businesses in Europe, with a target of EUR 30 billion for the period 2008-2011.</p>
<p>Finally, EU support instruments for RTD and innovation efforts by SMEs (such as the dedicated SME activities within the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP)) are important and effective in improving their competitiveness, as pointed out by the European Council meeting on 4 February 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000089"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Article 9(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation) states that a Commission proposal ‘shall be adopted by the Council unless it decides by a simple majority to reject the proposal within a period of one month after its submission by the Commission’. This means that at least fourteen Member States must be opposed if the proposed measures are to be rejected. The result of an informal consultation procedure on the proposal referred to by the honourable Member which ended on 24 February was that the majority of Member States did not reject the proposal. For that reason, the Presidency sees no need for further debate or for the matter to be referred back to the Committee stage. It will therefore recommend that, in order to comply with European Union law, the Council adopt the Commission proposal.</p>
<p>The information submitted by wind turbine or wind turbine blades manufacturers (a downstream user industry) during the investigation has been limited and of only a very general nature. Written submissions indicate that the vast majority of fibreglass products imported from China by this specific user sector fall outside the product scope of this proceeding. Furthermore, the cost and profitability analysis for the direct user industry, as summarised in recitals 119-126 of the proposed regulation, is reassuring, and the impact on further downstream users will be minimal.</p>
<p>The purpose of anti-dumping measures is to re-establish a level playing field on the Union market. Broader topics, such as the fight against climate change, are already covered by specific legislation, which includes public interest considerations. As a general rule, the Union interest analysis in trade defence investigations focuses on the economic impact of measures on the economic operators concerned. The industry within the EU cannot be deprived of its right to seek protection from unfair trade practices. Moreover, taking broader considerations into account would conflict with the precise technical nature of such investigations. Concerns relating to other aspects should be addressed through other appropriate instruments and measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000093"></a>

<p>(EN) While the Council does not have a role in the implementation or the preparatory actions of the European Year of Voluntary Activities as it is implemented by the Commission and the Member States, the Council on several occasions, notably in its sessions of May<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and November 2010<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, held an exchange of views on the possible future priority areas in the field of sport.</p>
<p>In the May Council meeting, the ministers in particular emphasised the importance of investing in grassroots sport by focusing on recreational and health enhancing sport. They suggested the following areas for possible EU action:</p>
<p>-	Social and educational functions of sport, e.g. social inclusion through sport and health enhancing physical activity, dual careers for athletes;</p>
<p>-	Sport structures, in particular, those based on voluntary activity;</p>
<p>-	Fairness and openness in sport, including the fight against racism, discrimination and violence;</p>
<p>-	Physical and moral integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen, especially the fight against doping and the protection of minors;</p>
<p>-	Dialogue and close cooperation with the sports movement.</p>
<p>In November 2010, the Council adopted a resolution establishing a high-level structured dialogue with sport stakeholders<a href="#defann_11_3" name="refann_11_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Such a dialogue will allow an ongoing exchange of views on priorities, implementation and follow-up to EU cooperation in the field of sport.</p>
<p>At the same meeting, the Council also adopted conclusions on the role of sport as a source of and a driver for active social inclusion<a href="#defann_11_4" name="refann_11_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The conclusions identify three common priorities for promoting social inclusion through sport: the accessibility of sport activity for all citizens (‘sport for all’ principle), better use of the potential of sport as a contribution to community building, social cohesion and growth, and transnational exchanges of strategies and methodologies.</p>
<p>The Presidency intends to invite the Council to respond to the Commission Communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’ by adopting a resolution in May 2011. Such a resolution could set out a limited number of priority areas and establish an EU work plan in the field of sport for the next three years. Moreover, the current and next Council Presidencies intend to use the theme of the year as a focus for a number of conferences and events.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) Under the terms of the Treaty, in particular, Articles 165 and 166 TFEU, education and training constitute an area of national competence in which the European Union has essentially only a supporting role. As a result, the possibilities for adopting measures and actions at EU level are extremely limited.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in recognition of the fact that Member States face common challenges in this field which call for joint responses, and that all can benefit from the exchange of experience, the Union has progressively intensified European cooperation in education and training over the last decade. This process of enhanced cooperation culminated in May 2009 in the Council's adoption of the ‘ET2020’ strategic framework<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, under which Member States agreed to take steps at national level in order to achieve a number of jointly agreed strategic objectives. To create momentum towards these objectives, the Member States also agreed on a series of reference levels of European average performance (commonly referred to as ‘benchmarks’), one of which relates specifically to the reduction of early school leaving, i.e. that by 2020, the share of early school leavers should be below 10%.</p>
<p>More recently, the importance of tackling this issue has been recognised at the highest level of the Union. In June 2010, the European Heads of State or Government adopted the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Acknowledging the fundamental role which education and training should play in the strategy, they agreed that improving education levels was a priority for the Union and - reflecting the benchmark adopted under the ‘ET2020’ framework - set an EU headline target of reducing the overall share of early school leavers to less than 10% by 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of the specific measures being considered in order to meet this ambitious target (the current EU average is 14.4%), the Council has already begun examining a Commission proposal for a Council Recommendation on policies to reduce early school leaving.</p>
<p>This sets out basic guidelines for coherent, comprehensive and evidence-based strategies to be adopted and implemented in the context of Member States’ national reform programmes, and funded through the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, and the European Social Fund. The proposal will be examined within the Council during March and April, with a view for the Presidency to submit it for adoption by the Council in May.</p>
<p>On a broader level, progress toward the EU headline target of reducing early school leaving to below 10%, along with progress towards all the objectives and targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, will be monitored regularly during the first half of each year in the context of the ‘European semester’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 2006 Services Directive provides for points of single contact to be set up in the Member States. These points of single contact are one of the key aspects of effectively implementing the directive, and represent a vital source of information for those wishing to provide cross-border services or set up business in another Member State. They are especially useful for small-scale service providers who often cannot afford consultations on another EU Member State’s employment law, tax law, procedures for setting up businesses, and so on.</p>
<p>In some Member States, points of single contact have not been set up or do not work well enough, insofar as they do not provide the comprehensive information that service providers need. Does the Council not think that these delays in setting up points of single contact are preventing service providers from taking up the opportunities provided by the common market and stopping SMEs from providing services in other EU Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(EN) The Points of single contact (PSC) were established in the Services Directive precisely to facilitate the lives of entrepreneurs by providing all the necessary information in a one-stop shop and it is important to make sure that they are in place and work in the best way possible to achieve their objective.</p>
<p>A great deal of work has already been done. PSC are now in place in 22 Member States. The five Member States without an operational PSC are advancing significantly and most are planning to make their PSC available in the course of 2011.</p>
<p>17 PSCs already allow for the online completion of some key procedures. Working in this direction would create a direct link between the ‘think small first’ principle, the Single Market Act and the ‘Digital agenda for Europe’. These three aspects, together with the monitoring of the implementation of the Services Directive have been the subject of constant and regular attention in the Council in the past years.</p>
<p>Overall, the development of the PSCs does not end with the implementation of the Services Directive. More work can be done to improve the existing PSCs to make them more user-friendly and useful for entrepreneurs, both as regards the availability and presentation of information as well as ease of the completion of procedures online within a Member State and particularly across borders.</p>
<p>In this perspective, the Presidency intends to submit Council Conclusions on a better functioning single market for services to the Council of 10 March 2011. In these Conclusions, the Council is expected to emphasise the importance of stepping up efforts for the full implementation of the Services Directive while welcoming the achievements so far, including the results of the mutual evaluation exercise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000104"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has always expressed in the strongest terms its condemnation and rejection of killings and other human rights violations in Colombia.</p>
<p>In the context of its political dialogue with the Colombian authorities and, in particular, within the framework of its dedicated high-level dialogue on human rights, the EU has consistently urged Bogotá to step up its efforts to protect the most vulnerable population groups, including the leaders and members of trade unions.</p>

<p>(EN) The EU has an established policy on promoting good governance in tax matters which is based on three principles: transparency of tax systems, exchange of tax information and fair tax competition. Although so-called ‘tax havens’ are de facto covered, the policy is not targeted at those, but aims at improving good tax governance in general.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively pursuing the implementation of the actions defined in its 2009 and 2010 communications on the ‘Promotion of good governance in tax matters’ and on ‘Tax and development’, which form the basis of its policy in this field. In practice, this means:</p>
<p>in the field of transparency and exchange of information, ensuring that tax administrations have access, can process and effectively exchange between themselves relevant (tax) information on taxpayers;</p>
<p>in the field of harmful tax competition, removing those tax regimes designed to unfairly attract taxpayers from other countries, while maintaining the capacity to use taxation as a fair competition tool in the Single Market.</p>
<p>This strategy has a clear international dimension. The Commission pushes for the inclusion of commitments to good governance in the tax area during the negotiations on EU agreements with third countries. Moreover, it builds on joined efforts undertaken in other international fora such as the G20, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the United Nations.</p>
<p>As regards taxation of savings income, and beyond existing agreements with third countries, the Commission is actively promoting its standards – including automatic exchange of information – both in its discussions with European countries that are not members of the EU and with other important financial centres such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>The matter of tax justice is not within the Commission's remit. The Commission acknowledges the prime responsibility of countries to improve their revenue systems and policies according to their own economic and political circumstances and choices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000100"></a>

<p>(EN) Both the Commission and the Council repeatedly signalled downside fiscal and macro-economic risks related to the property boom in Ireland from as early as 2000, as part of our regular fiscal surveillance procedures and also later in 2007 and 2008 under the Lisbon Strategy. Despite this, the Commission has acknowledged that macro-economic oversight across all Member States in future needs to be broader and its surveillance mandate needs to be expanded to cover also risks building up in the private sector.</p>
<p>On the interest rate, the Commission supports, in principle, a reduction of the interest rate margin on the European portion of the borrowing covered by the EFSM and the EFSF. However, a final decision on this matter would be for the Council and the euro area Member States and would have to be viewed in the context of a comprehensive package that would include progress on economic governance in the euro area, the new European Stabilisation Mechanism (ESM) and the adjustment measures by Member States. For Ireland, any reduction in interest costs could not alter the agreed consolidation path which would see Ireland reach a 3% of GDP deficit by 2015.</p>
<p>As to the scope for modifying the EU-IMF financial assistance programme, the main elements or goalposts of the programme should not be renegotiated. The policy path set out in the programme is adequate to achieve its goals. The programme’s quarterly reviews offer an opportunity to evaluate whether changed circumstances warrant changes in specific elements of the programme. But all measures should take account of their effects on growth, competitiveness and the long-run sustainability of public finances.

It contains horizontal policy guidance for the EU and euro area focused on ten priority policy actions, which can have material impact on competitiveness, growth and macro-financial stability. The priority actions encompass macro-economic pre-requisites for growth, labour market reforms for higher employment and frontloading growth-enhancing structural reforms.

<p>(EN) Staff teams from the Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) visited Athens during 27 January to 11 February 2011 for the third review of the government’s economic programme, which is being supported by an EUR 80 billion loan from euro area countries and a EUR 30 billion Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The Commission raises the attention of the honourable Member that the winter 2011 update of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), as well as the Commission compliance report, can be found on the Europa website<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>The overall assessment was that the programme has made further progress toward its objectives. While there have been delays in some areas, the underlying fiscal and broader reforms necessary to deliver the programme’s medium-term objectives are being put in place. In particular:</p>
<p>Greece achieved an impressive fiscal adjustment in 2010. The fiscal deficit for 2010 is estimated at 9½ percent of GDP; this is a fall of 6 points from 2009. However, the deficit was well above the programme target of 8 percent of GDP. Whilst the slippage was, to a large extent, related to the revision of statistics in autumn 2010, budget implementation encountered several problems. The fight against tax evasion has not (yet) yielded the hoped-for gains and there remain important problems in expenditure control.</p>
<p>For 2011, the target is of a fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP, which remains in line with the programme’s target. This means that, in spite of the weaker-than-planned fiscal performance in 2010, the government has committed to catch up in 2011 and keep the fiscal adjustment effort on track, as initially planned. The fiscal targets of the programme have not been revised.</p>
<p>The government is currently preparing its medium-term fiscal strategy, with a view to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2014. In the context of this medium-term strategy, the government decided to considerably scale up its initial privatisation and real estate development programme, with a view to improve debt sustainability. The objective is to realise EUR 50 billion in privatisation proceeds from now to 2015. The proceeds from privatisation are to be used to redeem debt and do not substitute fiscal consolidation efforts. This has the potential of cutting the debt ratio by more than twenty points of GDP over the next five years. If successful, this new initiative has the potential of substantially improving the market sentiment vis-à-vis Greece. The Commission and the euro area partners should encourage Greece to show resolve in its privatisation programme.</p>
<p>The details and modalities of the privatisation and real estate development programme shall be designed, decided and announced by the government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Following the President of the Commission’s announcement in the State of Union speech to the Parliament in September 2010, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have worked intensively to design the eventual scheme for EU project bonds. A stakeholder consultation paper with the proposed design was formally launched at a press conference given by the Member of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs and EIB President Maystadt on 28 February 2011.</p>
<p>The consultation will run until 2 May 2011, with a final conference on 11 April 2011, and its aim is to allow the Commission to eventually establish a proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework in June 2011.</p>
<p>The general idea is to enable project companies to raise financing for infrastructure projects in the capital markets through bond issues, in addition to the traditional methods of obtaining loans.</p>
<p>Suitable projects should be in line with the Europe 2020 objectives, for example, long-term infrastructure projects that are of major public interest and have revenue potential.</p>
<p>Attracting sufficient financing is difficult because of the risks associated with the long-term nature of such projects.</p>
<p>In order to bridge this funding gap, the EU and the EIB would assume part of this risk, so that the private debt financing would become easier, and long-term capital market investors could find it attractive to invest in such long-term bonds. Such long-term investors are, for instance, insurance companies and pension funds.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that both the EIB and the EU would share the risk related and the remuneration, but would not issue bonds. In other words, this initiative should not be confused with the so called ‘Eurobonds’, which commonly refer to joint debt issuance by Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000081"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU is negotiating with Mercosur an association agreement which is composed of three chapters: Political, Economic and Trade. Negotiations were resumed in May last year at the EU-Mercosur summit. Since then, there have been three rounds of negotiations. However, up to now, discussions have focused on rules such as sanitary requirements, technical barriers, trade defence instruments or general rules for services and government procurement. No discussions have taken place on market access yet.</p>
<p>After each round, written reports as well as the updated texts have been sent to the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and the Trade Policy Committee in the Council.</p>
<p>Whereas it is still too early to identify the main difficulties of these negotiations, it is clear that discussions on market access, especially in agriculture, will prove to be challenging.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the Parliament that it is fully aware of the sensitivities of the European agricultural and food sectors. This is why it always made clear to Mercosur - from the very beginning of the negotiations - that for certain agricultural products, we would not be in position to fully liberalise trade with Mercosur. Beef is one of these products.</p>
<p>It is, however, important to remember that the EU also has offensive interests in agriculture and it should therefore seek the elimination of existing Mercosur import duties on agri-food products as well.</p>
<p>Even if agriculture will be a difficult area of negotiations, the Commission expects the same to be the case for discussions on market access in Mercosur for EU industrial products and for services.</p>
<p>The EU and Mercosur are now, on both sides, preparing internally the market access offers. Once these offers are ready, a decision will be taken on the best timing to proceed to a simultaneous exchange.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is fully aware of the concerns raised by the honourable Member, as well as those expressed by the farmers in the EU, regarding the need for compliance of imported products with the same quality standards as goods produced in the EU.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission wishes to stress that all agricultural products that are placed on the EU market have to comply with the import requirements regarding food safety, animal and plant health, as well as certain animal welfare aspects. These imported products are therefore considered as safe.</p>
<p>The Commission can guarantee that the EU-Mercosur Agreement, like any other bilateral trade agreements, will not lead to a lowering of EU import requirements.</p>
<p>Animal, plant and food safety standards, related to trade with third countries, deserve particular attention and will be addressed in the negotiation. The Commission is committed to negotiate the inclusion of EU standards and to put in place technical collaboration programmes in the future EU Mercosur association agreement.</p>
<p>The dates of the three following rounds of negotiations have already been scheduled for March, May and July 2011, alternately in Brussels and Paraguay. The Commission's objective for the moment remains to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000090"></a>

An FTA will further increase investment opportunities for European companies in India, and enhance access to markets both for European and for Indian firms. The benefits of trade are likely to help lift millions of Indians out of poverty.</p>
<p>As India goes further down the road towards becoming a knowledge-based economy and innovation plays a greater role in the Indian economy, investment by innovative European companies will also help to foster innovation. However, innovation relies on a sound intellectual property rights framework. Unless the fruits of innovation can be protected, there is little incentive for innovative companies to invest.</p>
<p>How is the Commission taking into account the importance of intellectual property rights for innovation in the current negotiations for an FTA with India?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees that the EU’s trade policy has a key role to play in achieving the goals of the EU 2020 strategy by stimulating growth and jobs. The negotiation of a free trade agreement with India offers a significant opportunity to deliver on these goals.</p>
<p>The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India is of major economic and strategic importance. As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India is an important trade partner for the EU and a growing global economic power. It combines a growing market of more than 1 billion people with a growth rate of between 8 and 10%.</p>
<p>The adequate protection of our Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is an essential element of our external competitiveness strategy.</p>
<p>If the EU wants to remain a competitive economy, it will have to rely on innovation, creativity and brand exclusivity. This is one of the EU’s main comparative advantages on the world market. So the EU needs the tools to ensure that this comparative advantage is adequately protected in our main export markets, including India.</p>
<p>The EU’s objective in the IPR negotiations is to ensure that European innovators are able to operate and to compete in a legally secure and non-discriminatory environment and to guarantee a fair level of protection for innovations, inventions and creations</p>
<p>Moreover, that will enhance access to markets both for European and Indian companies and enable India to increase its own innovative capacity and contribution to the global economy.</p>
<p>An important element to keep in mind in this context is the role that India plays as a key provider of generic medicines to the developing world. The EU will therefore make sure that the IPR provisions in the FTA are balanced and that they would in no way hamper access to affordable medicines in India and in other developing countries. Effective IPR protection and access to medicines can, and should, be mutually supportive.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, in the interest of both the EU and India to secure a sound and balanced IP environment which will foster growth, facilitate business and create jobs in both our economies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000072"></a>

<p>The safety of sweeteners - and aspartame in particular - are kept under regular review by EFSA.

<p>(FR) Helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make better use of the opportunities offered by the Single Market is one of the basic principles of the ‘Small Business Act’ for Europe (SBA). This will remain one of the areas of priority action in the revision of the SBA, adopted on 23 February 2011. In addition, the ‘Innovation Union’ is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. In its Communication of 6 October 2010<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission put forward a package of measures designed to ensure better exploitation of innovative ideas on the market, such as the creation of a single innovation market and support for industries with great creative potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the most effective ways of supporting the activity of innovative enterprises is to improve their access to financing. Over the period 2007-2010, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), through its strand on facilitating access to venture capital for enterprises with great innovation potential, resulted in investments in 129 fast growing enterprises with a leverage effect equivalent to seven times the contribution of the EU budget. What is more, thanks to the JEREMIE initiative, the Structural Funds also contribute to the financing of SMEs with innovation potential.</p>
<p>Firstly, through their participation in the Seventh Framework Programme, SMEs themselves are able to create their own network in order to gain easier access to the international market and to cooperate more effectively with other innovative players. Secondly, 20 000 SMEs are able to benefit from direct support amounting to EUR 5 billion.</p>
<p>For the period 2014-2020, the Commission has set itself the objective of putting in place financial instruments to attract a major increase in private finance and close the market gaps in investing in research and innovation. Contributions from the EU budget should create a major leverage effect and expand on the success of FP7 and CIP. The Commission will work with the European Investment Bank Group, national financial intermediaries and private investors in order, first, to invest in knowledge transfer and start-ups, second, to provide venture capital for fast growing firms expanding on EU and global markets and, third, to grant loans for innovative SMEs.</p>
<p>In this context, it should also be recalled that, on 9 February 2011, the Commission published a Green Paper on the Common Strategic Framework: ‘From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation funding’<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Until 20 May 2011, the Commission is inviting stakeholders wishing to present their observations to participate in a public consultation on this issue at: http://ec.europa.eu/research/csfri/index_en.cfm#" .</p>
<p>Other lines of action aim to establish stronger links between innovative enterprises and suitable investors at transnational level and to enable venture capital funds established in any given Member State to operate and invest freely throughout the EU by 2012. Furthermore, in the context of the SME Finance Forum, the Commission will address, among other things, the specific funding problems faced by small innovative companies.</p>
<p>The new Single Market Act also recognises the need to create an environment in which SMEs can flourish. Specific actions to improve SME access to capital markets and to simplify the administrative environment have been proposed.</p>
<p>What is more, the Commission intends to make information and support services better known to SMEs so as to facilitate access to cross-border trade activities. The existing networks and instruments such as Enterprise Europe Network, Solvit, Your Europe Business Portal, and the Small Business Portal will be mobilised for this purpose.</p>
<p>A communication to strengthen support for SMEs on markets outside the EU is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Communication on the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states the following: ‘Remove existing navigability bottlenecks on the river as to accommodate type VI b vessels all year round by 2015’. Type VI b vessels refers to the international classification of European Inland Waterways by UNECE<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and means ‘pushed convoys with one push boat and four barges’. This is the prevailing vessel formation on the Danube. For most of the Danube, the river is accommodating to VI b vessels.</p>
<p>The same document states: ‘the Commission strongly believes that setting targets is essential, to focus and prioritise efforts’. These targets are now being further developed with Member States and stakeholders and shall be finalised before the European Council in June 2011. Consequently, the targets which were included in the document play the role of examples. In the specific case of the navigability target the honourable Member refers to, the Commission has already opened extensive discussions with the concerned partner countries in order to provide a more flexible approach, as also requested by the ‘Joint Statement on Guiding Principles for the Development of Inland Navigation and Environmental Protection in the Danube River Basin’, to the specific situations like that in the section of Straubing-Vilshofen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the measures to remove these bottlenecks have to be assessed in an Environmental Impact Assessment according to the natural characteristics of the stretch, its morphology and hydrology. Solutions for improved navigability will have to be reconciled with other objectives, such as the achievement of good water status, and the reduction of water continuity interruptions for fish migration. This is reflected in the Communication and Action Plan on the European Union Strategy for the Danube Region.</p>

<p>(EN) Freedom of peaceful assembly as provided in Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on Human Rights is part of the principles upon which the Union is founded.

<p>Issues pertaining to the organisation of public meetings in the Member States and to the safety of the individuals during those events fall under the competence of the Member States. The Commission has no power to intervene in how Member States organise public meetings. In that matter, it is thus for Member States alone to ensure that their obligations regarding fundamental rights – as resulting from international agreements and from their internal legislation – are respected.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that the Metropolitan Court in Budapest overturned on 18 February 2011 the police decision of 11 February, which withdrew the permission to organise the Budapest’s Pride Parade planned for 18 June 2011. The Commission has full confidence in the willingness of the Hungarian authorities and all Member States, as required by their own constitutions and international obligations, to ensure respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The Commission reiterates its commitment to combating homophobia and discrimination based on sexual orientation to the full extent of the powers conferred on it by the Treaties. As regards the measures taken in this respect, the Commission would refer the honourable Member to its answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-7-2011-000338_EN.html">P-338/11</a> by Mr Cashman<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Numerous medical research establishments in the EU assist couples in achieving their dream of having a child with the help of surrogate motherhood. This method of reproduction is authorised or laid down by law in a number of Member States, whilst in other Member States, it is prohibited by law and therefore punishable. This unequal legal treatment within the EU encourages trafficking, including, in particular, to third countries. A coordinated stance within the EU is needed on this sensitive issue.</p>
<p>Could the Commission give an overview of the legal situation with regard to surrogate motherhood in the 27 Member States?</p>

<p>(EN) The Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union do not give the European Union powers to adopt legislation on harmonisation of national laws on methods of reproduction with the help of surrogate mothers. It is therefore incumbent on individual Member States to regulate this matter in the light of their social and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>As the matter in question is not within the Commission’s remit, the Commission does not gather information on the legal situation with regard to surrogate motherhood in the 27 Member States and is therefore unable to give an overview of the relevant national legal framework.</p>
<p>The Commission has no plans to explore coordination of the issue of surrogate motherhood within the EU.</p>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, as the European Union is a full member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the Commission follows developments on surrogate motherhood at international level. The issue was raised in June 2010 during the work of the Special Commission on the practical operation of the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, which recommended that the Hague Conference should carry out further studies on the legal issues surrounding surrogate motherhood.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000099"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is sensitive to the issues raised by the honourable Member. It recalls that the design of health and social welfare policies, including the budget allocated to them, remains the exclusive responsibility of the Member States. This being so, the Commission recalls that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that ‘a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities’.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the impact of the austerity measures that Greece has to take on its public welfare facilities. For this reason, the Commission strongly encourages Greece to make full use of the Structural Funds to support the development of health and social welfare policies. In Greece, the EU co-finances activities through the operational programmes of the 2007-13 National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) related to the construction of health and welfare infrastructure, the modernisation of the mental health system, the promotion of social inclusion for vulnerable groups, the improvement of the quality of life and the strengthening of social cohesion.</p>
