Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Duisenberg, I have been reading your biography in recent weeks and have found it very enjoyable and interesting. The book begins with a beautifully written preface describing the tough negotiations that preceded your appointment as the first President of the Central Bank. They were difficult negotiations that were to lay the foundations of a stringent policy aimed at stabilising the euro. If one thing became clear, however, it was that you set your very own course for the European Central Bank, in which political views did not play a role. It is an ironic twist of fate, then, that the very country that found it hard to accept your nomination for longer than four years, asked a few months ago whether you would like to stay on a little longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duisenberg, your last annual report has come out in a period in which the growth of the European economy has stagnated. The last quarter saw zero growth. Some Member States are thus officially in recession, and that means that the economy has contracted for the second consecutive quarter. This puts the European Union in a worrying situation. The measures taken by the Union and the Member States have thus proved unable to turn the economic tide in the short term, and it is in this very period that we are discussing the fifth annual report of the European Central Bank. It is an annual report about a very eventful year; a year in which citizens had their first chance to show their confidence in the euro; and a year which was preceded by higher expectations as regards economic recovery following the September 11 attacks. Many of those expectations were not realised. New threats slowed down the pace of recovery, and the euro is yet to inspire great confidence in citizens. The fact that 300 million inhabitants of the euro zone are making full use of the new currency does not prove anything except that they have no real alternative: they have to use it, and no further political conclusions can be drawn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">In a climate of uncertainty such as this, it is not surprising that the ECB has its work cut out if it is to fulfil the objective of stability. It is not only the responsibility of the ECB, however, but also of the Member States; after all, it is their budgetary policy that lays the foundations for a stable euro. I should like to devote attention to a few further points in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important that we make our position known succinctly in the form of a resolution. Now is not the time to reveal all of our political desires for change. The most important thing, in this economically less prosperous time, is that Parliament make clear that it supports a policy that has stability as its aim. Stability of the currency, and hopefully a return to economic growth in the short term, are necessary in order to restore the confidence of manufacturers and consumers and revive the economy. The number of new political desires contained in the resolution is therefore limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it would be ill-advised to start tampering with the ECB's objectives already. The resolution emphasises – incidentally following on from earlier resolutions – that price stability is, and must remain, the chief objective of the ECB. New objectives, such as the promotion of economic growth and other tasks, are subordinate to this. An important argument for this relates to the short history of the Bank. To date, the Bank has not been confronted with a Europe-wide recession; it has, however, met with repeated criticism of its policy. For example, in times of economic prosperity, there was a great deal of criticism when the exchange rate of the euro depreciated, and also now, when it is rising – even though the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is not an aim in itself. What is important is monetary stability within the euro zone itself, and this is the ECB's responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, a real acid test is yet to come. The Bank has yet to prove its ability to fulfil the objective of price stability in times of recession, too, using the existing instruments. In addition to this, inflation has been relatively high up to now, and real wages are increasing sharply despite the increase in unemployment, which indicates continuing structural rigidities in the labour markets. I should like to emphasise that it is important for precisely that price stability – to which consumer confidence is inextricably linked – that the ECB be allowed to continue to do its work independently of politics. Parliament therefore bears some of the responsibility for creating the political preconditions for this by means of a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Duisenberg, on the back cover of your biography there is a photograph of you evidently enjoying your hobby, fishing. I wish you a good catch, and I also wish you good health and enjoyment of the finer things in life in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is pleased to see Parliament undertaking this activity, which contributes to our joint efforts to improve the framework of macroeconomic policy in the Union and, especially, in the Eurozone. The report clearly pursues the approach adopted in previous years and contains numerous aspects with which the Commission fully agrees. There is no doubt that the euro has been an enormous success and we must all thank the European Central Bank for the hard work it has carried out to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers that the Central Bank has done an excellent job in recent years with regard to its basic task, which is to ensure price stability, and we also share the concerns at the inadequate structural reforms and at the fiscal consolidation that is taking place in Europe. Nevertheless, my position is rather more circumspect on some points. Firstly, with regard to the Central Bank’s mandate, the Treaty makes this mandate quite clear: to maintain price stability. It is true that the Bank is also asked to support the general policies of the Community, but this must be done without undermining the aim of stability. Mr Blokland’s report appears to suggest a rather different interpretation of the mandate, and this aspect was highlighted by the Commission last month, when the report was debated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report calls for the Central Bank to take action in other areas for which we do not believe it has a mandate. It calls on the Bank, for example, to back the denomination of energy supplies and commodities in euros. On this point, the Commission’s position is the same as the Bank’s in that it should be neutral with regard to the international use of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Blokland’s report assesses the European Central Bank’s management of its budget. From the formal point of view and without having access to the latest audit report covering 2001, this assessment might, in our opinion, be somewhat premature. In any event, I wish to thank him for his comments and say that I am particularly pleased to be here in Parliament, particularly on such a special day, with Mr Duisenberg present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duisenberg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Central Bank</span>.<span class="bold"> </span><span class="bold"></span> Mr President, thank you for your kind words of introduction. I would also like to thank Mr Blokland for the kind words with which he introduced the resolution which is before you today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed a pleasure today <span class="bold"></span> despite the fact that it is in all likelihood the last time that I shall be here <span class="bold"></span> to introduce the ECB's Annual Report for 2002, a year that was marked <span class="bold"></span> despite all the incidents you may have found overwhelming in your minds <span class="bold"></span> by significant progress on our path towards a more integrated Europe. In particular, 2002 saw the successful introduction of the euro in its tangible form, as euro banknotes and coins have been swiftly accepted and embraced by the citizens of the euro area. Moreover, the Heads of State or Government, at their summit meeting in December last year, took the historic decision to invite ten countries to join the European Union as of 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the environment in which monetary policy was conducted in 2002 was one of considerable uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the slowdown in economic activity in 2001, a moderate recovery of real GDP growth in the euro area was recorded at the beginning of 2002. However, as the year progressed, the recovery lost momentum, affected by renewed turbulence in financial markets and geopolitical tensions, which had consequences for oil prices and confidence. Overall, annual real GDP growth in the euro area is estimated to have been only 0.8% in 2002, compared with 1.4% in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the subdued pace of real economic growth, inflation remained at 2.3% on average in 2002, unchanged from 2001, and slightly above the European Central Bank's definition of price stability. This was partly due to a number of temporary or one-off factors, including higher oil prices, indirect tax increases and adverse weather conditions. On top of this, there is no denying that there were some effects from the cash changeover. While the overall impact of the cash changeover on inflation was small, its perceived impact was much greater than its actual impact, probably due to comparatively strong price increases in some specific sectors. Of greater concern for the medium-term outlook for price stability was the fact that nominal wage growth remained relatively strong despite the weakening of economic activity and a rise in unemployment, while productivity growth remained low. This development points to persistent structural rigidities in the labour markets of the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">Monetary growth was strong in 2002. While this development was partly the result of high volatility in financial markets, which heightened investors' preference for short-term liquid and less risky financial assets, it also reflected the relatively low interest rates in the euro area in 2002. Overall, however, the excess liquidity was not seen to indicate risks to price stability in an environment of subdued economic activity and moderate credit growth.</p>
<p class="contents">While some factors pointed to possible upward inflationary pressures at the beginning of the year, later in the year the worsening outlook for economic activity and the sizeable and protracted appreciation of the euro increasingly pointed towards lower inflationary pressures over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">This move was followed in March 2003 by a reduction of 25 basis points and by a further 50 basis point reduction last month, in June 2003. These rate cuts provided some counterweight to the various factors having an adverse effect on economic activity and thereby improved the prospects for price stability over the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">With these decisions, the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations reached 2% in June 2003. Interest rates in the euro area are now at record low levels by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the current outlook for price stability, Eurostat's flash estimate of annual inflation in the euro area was 2% for June 2003. The appreciation of the euro, which has brought exchange rates to levels close to long-term averages and more in line with economic fundamentals, should contribute to keeping inflationary pressures low. In addition, in a context of moderate economic recovery, wage growth is expected to remain compatible with the maintenance of price stability. The strong monetary growth also should not, for the time being, adversely affect the outlook for price stability. While the outlook for price stability has remained broadly unchanged since our last decision on 5 June 2003, the Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the outlook for price stability is favourable, having allowed interest rates to fall to historically low levels, monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. Other policy-makers also have to take up their responsibilities. Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of both fiscal and structural reforms to further improve the conditions for investment and employment. I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms in the labour and product markets, given their positive impact on the euro area's ability to better withstand external shocks, as well as to increase its growth potential. Fiscal policies should also strive to establish a well-designed consolidation strategy in those countries struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances. A medium-term, stability-oriented approach for economic policies would eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives, which would also have positive effects over the shorter term. In fact, at present, the situation of subdued economic growth and the stronger external value of the euro make the structural reforms even more necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to some other issues raised in the draft resolution on the ECB's Annual Report. I have noted <span class="bold"></span> and I welcome <span class="bold"></span> that in several important aspects the views expressed in the draft resolution are very similar to those held by the ECB, for instance as regards the need for Member States to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and the importance of honouring their commitments under the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, in particular, again, with respect to structural reforms. I also appreciate the fact that your draft resolution welcomes the clarifications of the ECB's monetary policy strategy which we made public in May of this year. These clarifications, while reflecting the overall successful experience with the ECB's monetary policy strategy since its inception, will further foster understanding of the monetary policy of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">While the European Parliament and the ECB hold similar views on many important issues, some differences in views remain, such as regarding the draft resolution's suggestion that the ECB should publish the summary minutes and the balance of votes of Governing Council meetings. For a number of reasons, which I have pointed out on previous occasions before Parliament, we believe that the tools chosen by the ECB to communicate and explain its decisions ensure transparency, are more readily available and better reflect the institutional environment in which the ECB operates. You will also not be surprised that I cannot share the view that the ECB's decision-making process might have been delayed by the fact that most Governing Council decisions have so far been taken by consensus. Indeed, the Governing Council has taken its decisions in a timely manner, responding appropriately to changing economic conditions whenever required.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution also refers to the Beige Book of the Federal Reserve System as being a benchmark for country-by-country reviews to be conducted by the Eurosystem. Let me point out that the national central banks within the Eurosystem regularly monitor and analyse macroeconomic, fiscal as well as structural developments in their respective countries, publishing their findings in their monthly, quarterly or annual reports. These analyses clearly enhance our understanding of euro area developments. However, given its euro area focus, it is natural for the European Central Bank to pay greater attention to the euro area perspective in its explanations of the single monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we are currently experiencing truly historic developments. The dream of a united Europe stretching beyond former post-war rifts is about to become reality. Although major challenges lie ahead, as many of the acceding countries are still developing into fully-fledged market economies, I believe that the signing of the Accession Treaty at the Athens summit in April testified to our joint belief in an integrated Europe. The clear endorsement of the Treaty in the national referenda that have already taken place in a number of acceding countries provides evidence of this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that an enlarged European Union will require a number of adaptations in the working procedures and the internal functioning of European institutions and bodies, including a reform of the voting modalities of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am well aware of the views that the European Parliament has expressed in this regard, but let me again point out that the Nice Treaty set clear conditions and limits within which our reform proposal had to be formulated. While the adopted changes in the voting modalities are, admittedly, complex, the tried-and-tested principles of the Eurosystem constitution, in particular the <span class="italic">ad personam</span> participation of governors and the 'one member, one vote' principle for the members exercising a voting right, have been kept fully intact. This will ensure that, also in a significantly enlarged euro area in the future, the Governing Council will maintain its capacity for timely and efficient decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Upon accession, the new Member States will join Economic and Monetary Union with the status of 'countries with a derogation', and their central banks will immediately become part of the European System of Central Banks. At a later stage, these central banks will become part of the Eurosystem, once their respective countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria for adopting the euro. A key priority of the European Central Bank is to have in place the necessary technical and institutional infrastructure to ensure an orderly enlargement of the European System of Central Banks and, later on, of the Eurosystem. An interesting foretaste of the new, larger ESCB was provided by the General Council meeting last week where, for the first time, the governors of the acceding countries' central banks participated as observers in a meeting of the General Council of the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">With this look towards the future, I should like to conclude my statement. This, indeed, will be the last time that I have the opportunity to present to you the Annual Report of the European Central Bank, which I have had the honour and the privilege to preside over for the last five years. Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for the cooperation and cordial relations that we have maintained.</p>

I will not wish you good luck in your fishing, Mr Duisenberg, because, as an Italian from the south of Italy, I am afraid that it might bring you bad luck.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland, whose report focuses on the responsibilities of the European Central Bank in Europe and the responsibilities that it will have to take on with a view to the imminent entry of the ten new countries into the Union. According to the terms of the Treaties, the primary goal of the European Central Bank is to define monetary policy in Europe and to ensure price stability through monetary policy. Personally, I am convinced that, irrespective of this principal responsibility, the European Central Bank must play a more effective role in the economy, using moral suasion methods, not least, which have yielded surprisingly successful results in the field of bank supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled an amendment, which was not accepted in committee, which sought to provide a more detailed, comprehensive definition of the Pact. It would have read as follows: a uniform interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact must be achieved in order to avoid undermining the credibility of the euro area and thus the effectiveness of its monetary policy; considers that the European Central Bank must confirm to the Commission that the Pact is being implemented with sufficient flexibility as to promote growth. Indeed, the Pact was created not just with a view to achieving stability but also in order to boost growth to acceptable levels. Growth as a key objective of the Pact can also be achieved through investment in large-scale work and financial undertakings in the field of research, outside public spending. Of course, this option must not become an excuse for abandoning the rigour of public finances and must be supported by a totally sustainable fiscal policy, as implemented so successfully in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The recently approved draft Constitution includes provisions governing the European monetary institutions, or rather, the role of the ECB and the national central banks and their sensitive relationship. Over this period, some national central banks have feared radical resizing with subsequent centralisation of power in Frankfurt. They did not want the European Central Bank to become a fully-fledged institution on the grounds that this would jeopardise the independence of the monetary institution, but I am sure this was just an excuse. This deadlock between the European Central Bank and the national central banks has caused confusion, and it is only in Article 29(3) that we have a comprehensive definition: the European Central Bank shall have legal personality. Looking at the other decisions made in this field, it has to be said that, in Europe and Parliament, as elsewhere, the compromise approach has taken root which often, far from bringing about convergence of differing positions, generates, in many cases, uncertainty and confusion regarding the matter in question. As a result of these compromises, a complicated method of voting has been decided on for the members of the Bank’s Governing Council, the printing of banknotes has been split willy-nilly between the different monetary institutions, and, above all, a decentralised system has been preserved which will become overcomplicated and ineffective with eastward enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, over and above the Convention’s decisions, we need to ask ourselves whether, in order to take into due account the guiding role of the European Central Bank and the interests of the individual national central banks, we should not be taking the path of dividing up the responsibilities between centre and periphery, with consequent specialisation of the national central banks, which would have to supervise minor financial institutions too. I hope that many of these points will be clarified at the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against this background it is therefore especially pleasing to note that no one disputes the successes achieved in establishing the issuing bank, introducing the notes and coins, and also in combating inflation. I would also like to thank you very sincerely for your cooperation and for the contribution you have made. The fact that 75% of Europe's citizens are now in favour of the euro must certainly be due in part to your work and your actions. We will of course do everything we can to win over the remaining 25%, and we hope that the three Member States still outside the euro area will soon be part of European monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Although interest rate levels are at an historically low level in Europe, I find myself wondering, when I consider the European Central Bank's monetary policy, about the appropriateness of those rates, given our failure to achieve our growth potential and the price stability guaranteed for the foreseeable future. That is why I ask myself if our monetary policy strategy is the optimum one. The bank itself has of course investigated to what extent it can be satisfied with its own monetary policy strategy, and I do indeed see that as being very helpful. However, we as politicians also need to consider at all times whether this monetary policy strategy is optimal not only in terms of monetary policy, but also as regards those aspects of macroeconomic policy that relate to the Lisbon objectives – growth, employment and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that does not make your job particularly easy, because there is also room for improvement in the coordination of economic, employment and finance policies. Nevertheless, I wonder what scope there is for making a further contribution. The definition of price stability now agreed upon, with a medium-term inflation rate target of under 2%, if only just, will help here. But I still believe that our bank of issue has a more rigid definition of price stability than other internationally important central banks. That is why we need constantly to reflect upon whether a certain change of course would not be appropriate. I also believe that it is important for us consistently to consider inflation, deflation and how they are defined, especially in view of the risk of deflation. Even during times of strong economic growth a symmetrical target of 2% with a range of plus or minus 1% should certainly be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB must not underestimate the importance of a strategy for low growth and increased employment in the euro area. Although this is, of course the secondary rather than the primary objective, we still do not as yet have a clear definition. It is apparent in the current economic situation that incentives for growth are urgently needed and I wish to specifically welcome new investment initiatives and also the support of the European Investment Bank. I view this initiative very much in the context of structural and fiscal reforms, but such reforms alone will not enable us to achieve the Lisbon objectives. That is why I believe this to be so important.</p>
<p class="contents">You will not be surprised if I refer once again to transparency of monetary policy, because this House has made its views on this very clear over the years. I still cannot see how it would jeopardise the effectiveness of the bank if summary minutes were to be published. Nor do I see how it would put the ECB or its independence at risk if the result of weighted votes were to be published without naming names. To my way of thinking, it would result in greater clarity, more information and it would avoid false reporting. I have in mind your last press conference and the way it was reported in the British press, which led to much speculation and aggravation on the markets. We could do something to change that. Greater transparency prevents inaccurate assessments, which in turn lead to bad investments – something we all wish to avoid. That is why I think it is important to do still more in this area. There is also scope for gaining greater public acceptance for the euro, for example by abolishing the 500-euro note or by printing a 1-euro note. After all, there is a 1-dollar note!</p>

I also wish to make a point of thanking its president, Mr Duisenberg, personally.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of euro notes and coins must be viewed as very successful. There were major logistical problems and plenty of opportunities to make mistakes, but the euro has become the second world currency in a very short period. On a recent visit of mine to Japan, a significant anxiety could be sensed faced with the strength of the euro and the economic advantages with which the euro provides the eurozone countries and the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, Mr Duisenberg, we shall be having a referendum in my country this autumn. It is no exaggeration to say that the name of the ECB is on everyone’s lips. In many respects, the Bank and the work you have carried out are commended but, in one area, the ECB is criticised in a way that I must admit is justified. It is a question of transparency and public scrutiny. Now, during the remainder of your time at the ECB, you should be able to make further efforts in this area. You have accommodated Parliament before and you can do so again. You are aware of our wishes and mentioned them before: open publication of the minutes of ECB Council meetings and annual publication of economic prognoses from individual countries, regions and border regions in the manner of what is termed the Beige Book in the United States. We must also obtain renewed discussion of the new voting rules. The principle must be clear: one country, one vote.</p>
<p class="contents">For myself, engaged, as I am, in an active struggle to persuade the Swedes to vote in favour of the euro, it is precisely the issue of the ECB’s lack of transparency that is a problem. If today, Mr Duisenberg, you could provide us with some encouraging news, it could cause more and more Swedes to accept the euro. Transparency and public scrutiny are always good for democracy. If the Swedish National Bank in Stockholm successfully manages to publish its minutes and votes, I am convinced that the ECB in Frankfurt should also proceed similarly.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking you and wishing you good fishing. Mr Duisenberg, in the future you can put up a sign saying ‘Gone fishing’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the Bank has been distinguished not so much by the successful operation of introducing the euro as by the line he established on monetary policy. Over the past few years, he has played a courageous, effective part in safeguarding the independence of monetary policy as a whole as well as that of the Central Bank against repeated attempts on the part of governments and many sections of public opinion to bend monetary policy to the short-term needs of a policy which has been unable to create the necessary conditions for success and economic growth in Europe. This morning, President Duisenberg said: ‘I probably cannot emphasise sufficiently the need to speed up the pace of structural reforms’. I hope that, despite the fact that they will be taking over in a climate and a situation in which we would prefer the procedures to be clearer and more transparent, his successor too will be able to focus consistently on the need for structural reform, on the need to safeguard the Stability Pact: this is the way to protect the future generations of Europeans, citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, President Duisenberg, best wishes for your birthday in a few days’ time. For the sake of all of us in Parliament, all of us European citizens, I hope that President Duisenberg’s successor will be able to do as good a job as he has. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add that budget deficits in Europe are another great weakness. Worse still, it is precisely the biggest countries that have allowed these large deficits to build up. However, in view of this it is also important to emphasise that this does not apply to all the EU Member States. There are in all seven countries in the European Union that either have a balanced budget, or, as in the case of Sweden, Denmark and Finland, have a budget surplus. So it is not acceptable for people constantly to talk about the 15 Member States of the EU as if the same problems applied to all of them. No, they are very different, and I believe that is something we need to spell out very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another factor here: there are countries that are not complying with the 3% criterion in the Stability Pact, especially of course France, Portugal and Germany. When I look at the Stability Pact I can only say that there is perhaps still a little glimmer of hope that it will survive. When you consider the debate going on in Germany, for example, and the fact that fiscal reform is not supposed to be counter-financed by cutting subsidies, then it is evident that Germany will be in breach of the pact for years to come. We do not therefore consider it acceptable for Europe's major economies to fail to implement the necessary structural reforms and thus fail to sort out their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible have repeatedly observed that it is precisely these countries that need to carry out structural reform in health services, for example, or in other areas across the whole range of social provision, because there are latent budgetary risks in these areas. This needs to be tackled once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that Mr Duisenberg put his stamp on the European Central Bank in the early years, when it was on the way to independence. This became apparent during the great many dialogues that we had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and for that, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you personally. It is vital that we should continue to prevent the bank from being politicised, so that the dialogue with Parliament should be about providing information and not justifications. That needs to be emphasised too. I believe that Mr Duisenberg himself has done a great deal to safeguard that independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point. Europe needs to be extremely flexible – we need flexible arrangements. But we do not want flexibility when it comes to Europe's Stability Pact. That is something I feel very strongly about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the good name that the European Central Bank (ECB)’s mandate under Mr Duisenberg’s Presidency has earned itself is widely acknowledged, and the conviction with which this institution defends its monetary policy is admirable: it considers that policy to be best suited to revitalising the European economy in the short term. The recent changes to the Bank’s monetary strategy are, furthermore, uniformly described as very positive. They are believed to constitute real progress. Indisputably, however, there is no sign of a European economic recovery in the immediate future. Moreover, all the political changes undertaken have been anticipated by the markets and diverted towards uses and balances which can contribute little towards that recovery in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is predicted that Europe’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth will reach around 0.7% in 2003, and that Europe’s GDP will increase by only 1.6% in 2004. At a stroke, in other words, the ECB is cutting a slice out of its growth predictions equivalent to about 0.9% of GDP in 2003, and 0.8% in 2004. Faced with the false dilemma of ‘growth or stability’, the ECB cannot be content with its primary institutional strategy, price stability, and disregard the weaknesses and contradictions of those of its policies directed at other targets, such as economic growth and employment. Furthermore, national governments, the Commission and the Council cannot, for their part, be satisfied with the low initial level of coordination between their economic policies, or with the merely advisory nature of their general economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the Bank, there are also good reasons for believing that mistakes were made in setting the point of departure for monetary policy levels (an inflation rate of 2%) and that these are not in line with the potential growth of the European economy. The European Central Bank must, therefore, help to find answers and solutions for the following fundamental questions: have the structural reforms carried out in most European economies been sufficient? If not, what additional contribution can monetary and fiscal policies make to the fight against the current situation of economic stagnation? Are the current monetary policy restrictions and the financial constraints imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, which the ECB has supported, compatible with the much-needed reform of the European social model, without calling into question its essence and the distinctive role it plays in the context of European development policy? Is the current appreciation of the euro entirely in step with the foundations of the European economy? Is it, moreover, a proactive aid to economic recovery, or could it, on the contrary, set off a severe deflationary trend? What contribution can the ECB make to overcome the lack of structural reforms necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy? Can those objectives be attained within the time limits initially set, given the monetary and fiscal policies which have been developed and the apparent preference of Member States for a minimal level of economic coordination?</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this economic crisis, the level of responsibility taken by the ECB and the active cooperation needed to weather the storm depend on finding a balance between the various options, and on the effectiveness of the solutions found for the problems that I have just described. Whilst acknowledging the positive balance-sheet of the Bank’s activities, which the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, does, the European Parliament should, in line with its duties and competences, draw attention to those problems that do exist and urge all the institutions to overcome them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my group I would like to say that you were the right man at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">You have not only shaped the image of the European Central Bank through your appearance; you have also shaped it by the sheer force of your personality. I myself have a three-year-old son and I therefore know how important, how eventful and how demanding the almost daily surprises of the early years of a child's life are. The early years of the European Central Bank's life have been successful ones and you have shouldered your specific responsibilities to our full satisfaction during those first few years. The introduction of the euro and the introduction of the euro notes and coins went smoothly. The ECB has made its mark as an independent European international bank. With a steady hand, you calmly steered our monetary policy on a successful course on the basis of the ECB Statute, building up confidence without being swayed by short-term populism, opportunism and carping. You demonstrated that for you the long haul was more important than short-term image building.</p>
<p class="contents">You also once again sounded a note of warning today when assessing the report. Those who deliver such warnings need credibility and integrity, and you possess both those qualities. You have reminded us again today that despite the successes of the European Central Bank, a great many tasks have been agreed as regards the economic policies of the Member States, and as regards our own work, which have not yet been completed. You also reminded us that structural reforms need to be given high priority in Europe's economic policy, because they underpin stability and growth; that fiscal policy needs to provide a stimulus and must be pursued; and that the Stability and Growth Pact should not be constantly called into question but must flank the ECB Statute by providing the necessary basis for a successful policy of stability and growth. You have once again reminded us that monetary policy can be no substitute for economic and cyclical policy and a corresponding structure, and our priorities must be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Through your work and that of your colleagues in the ECB, you have averted a number of monetary crises – we only have to think of 11 September and of the Asian and Russian crises. You have made an excellent job of preparing Europe and the ECB for enlargement, and we have also moved closer together, although there were often times when a little more communication and transparency would have been welcome. Nevertheless, our relationship has become a more open one. I would like to conclude by saying that as far as I am concerned, I would have been pleased to see you stay for the entire period of office! Many thanks for your work. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my own thanks to those already expressed to Mr Duisenberg, because, with the support of your colleagues and your committees, he has, over the last few years, managed the introduction of the euro in a way that has won growing support from the public. My sincere thanks to you for that, Mr Duisenberg. I have always admired the open and fair way in which you have discussed matters with us here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments we have heard in several speeches today are the same ones that have cropped up again and again in recent years. I have in mind in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, who asserted once again today that monetary policy can solve Europe's problems. She is mistaken. Structural and fiscal reforms alone cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives. In fact, the reverse is true. Even with a good monetary policy, the Lisbon objectives will not be achievable without structural reforms in the EU Member States. Mrs Randzio-Plath, we have two responsible experts in monetary policy with us today; Mr Duisenberg, for whom I have the highest esteem, and Mr Solbes Mira, whom I also regard very highly. Both of them have their roots in social democracy and are not prepared to accept your proposals. I would also like to express my sincere thanks for the consistent and reliable monetary policy that has prevailed over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, however, not the only subject we should mention in relation to the annual report, which is presumably the last one for which Mr Duisenberg will be responsible. The latest annual report – of which you can be proud, Mr Duisenberg – refers to the euro's position on the world stage, which it has earned. The euro has now returned to its previous strength; we have overcome the crises involving the euro. We have not put a foot wrong over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also once again heard that old story about the need for us to have immediate information about the internal decision-making processes of the ECB's committees. I think that is a mistake too. It is precisely this cautious assessment process that has guaranteed the internal stability of the euro in recent years while at the same time enhancing its external stability.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is also my belief that Mr Duisenberg's well-earned retirement and the appointment of his successor should not involve an arbitrary change in the European Central Bank's strategy. You have already changed the inflation range. It was the right decision not just to aim for the lowest possible inflation target, but to bunch it around 2%. We have heard bellyaching from the left of this House that there is a risk of inflation. That is pure nonsense! The totally normal adjustment of prices and of competitiveness in the euro area has led to varying inflation rates. The same applies to growth rates as well, of course. That is the responsibility of the Member States and that is how things should remain in future. That is why I am pleased that you have adopted this strategy in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the European Central Bank that is responsible for growth in Europe – in any case there are not many further options available in terms of monetary policy. It is the leaders of the governments, of the majority parties, in the three major Member States: Germany, France and Italy. Chancellor Schröder, Prime Minister Raffarin and Prime Minister Berlusconi need to carry out structural reforms. That needs to be our starting point, regardless of the basic political direction. In the long run, it is only by consistently adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact that we will be able to keep the euro internally and externally stable.</p>
<p class="contents">On that note, Mr Duisenberg, I would like to thank you for your excellent cooperation, which has been based on trust, and for your successful period of office, and to wish you all the very best for the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duisenberg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">ECB</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all let me thank all the Members that have spoken for their good wishes and in particular for their encouragement to the ECB to strictly adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">One has to realise that the Stability and Growth Pact is a very welcome additional element in forging our monetary policy. However, the ECB is not the guardian of the Stablility and Growth Pact; that is the European Commission. I can assure you, however, that the ECB has been and always will be squarely behind the European Commission in its endeavours to live up to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andria has referred to the position of the ECB and the ESCB as mentioned in Article 29 of the draft Constitution of the Convention, which will be under discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference as from the middle of October. May I add one remark? In general the ECB welcomes the draft Constitution in so far as its position is concerned. However, we have one overriding wish for change, concerning the fact that in the current Treaty and in the draft Constitution, the term European System of Central Banks is interpreted with some ambiguity. Sometimes it is to be understood that it refers to the total of all the central banks participating in the European System of Central Banks. Sometimes it is understood as comprising only the ECB itself and the participating national central banks. We have pleaded for the inclusion of a reference somewhere to the core concept of Europe's system of central banks, that is, the Eurosystem. It is the ECB that is the hub, the participating national central banks are the spokes; together they form the central banking system of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, when we are asked for an opinion, and we have to be asked for our opinion, urge the Intergovernmental Conference to make a reference somewhere in the text to this concept of the Eurosystem, which is the central bank of the European people, something which up until now has not been mentioned, either in the current Treaty or in the draft Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers <span class="bold"></span> Mrs Randzio-Plath and also others <span class="bold"></span> have expressed some doubts as to whether the current monetary policy stance is optimal. The last speaker, Mr Langen, even referred to statements made in recent days by some heads of government <span class="bold"></span> Mr Schroeder, Mr Raffarin, and Mr Berlusconi <span class="bold"></span> calling on the ECB to do more to promote growth in the current circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be crystal clear on that. The current monetary policy stance, in the eyes of the Governing Council, with interest rates at 2%, is regarded as being appropriate in the light of the developments we foresee for the medium-term future.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect inflation for the remaining months of this year to hover around this level of 2%, then early next year, mainly due to base effects, to fall significantly below the 2% limit and then, later on next year and in 2005, to climb back somewhat in a direction that will bring it close to 2%. That is our aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this monetary policy stance, which is regarded as appropriate in the light of analysis of the future, in so far as we can make it, one can conclude that monetary policy has played its part in creating the conditions for a resumption of economic growth and growth of employment in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have played our part and it is now the case that governments <span class="bold"></span> maybe I sound a little sharp <span class="bold"></span> can no longer hide behind the ECB to try to cover up their failure to enact the structural reforms which are so urgently required for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the definition of price stability too rigid? I do not believe so. We recently clarified our definition and our strategy. We are striving for a rate of inflation of below 2% but also close to 2%. That should be a guarantee to the European people that we are on our guard, not only to fight inflation, but also to fight deflation if it were to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me answer another question clearly. Mr Santos wondered whether there was a danger that the appreciation of the euro might lead us into a deflationary environment. The answer is that we do not see that. We do not expect deflation, not in Europe and not in individual component parts of the euro area. Deflation is not around the corner. That is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the definition too rigid? Let me speak anecdotally. We define our price stability as a rate of inflation of no more than 2%. Let me remind you and give an example. The Bank of England has inflation targeting, and the Chancellor imposes a target on the Bank of England of 2.5% inflation, 2.5% inflation as measured by the retail price index. Now the Chancellor has announced that probably in September, when he presents his mid-year budget, he will change the definition of the price index into the European one <span class="bold"></span> the harmonised index of consumer price inflation. When he does so, the implication is that the 2.5% in England will translate into less than 2% <span class="bold"></span> probably between 1.75% and 2% <span class="bold"></span> in terms of the harmonised index of consumer prices.</p>
<p class="contents">On publishing the minutes and being more transparent, I truly believe that there is no central bank in the world which is as transparent about its monetary policy decisions and the backgrounds and analyses leading up to decisions as the European Central Bank. About an hour after a decision has been taken, we hold a press conference and give all the necessary background and explanations which led us to take that decision and subsequently, in a question-and-answer session, we answer all the questions relating to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that if the minutes of those meetings were published there would be less confusion. May I refer to the decision taken last week by the Federal Reserve System, which immediately produced a press communiqué giving the decisions and stating how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee had voted. You all know now that has created more confusion than transparency in the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have answered the most pressing questions. I would like to thank the Members once again for their good wishes, both for the past and for my future. I should like to say to Mr Karas, who has a three-year-old son, that I have eight grandchildren of about the same age. They saw me recently on a television programme for children explaining the functioning of the euro and its intricacies. They called me after the television interview and I asked them if they had understood what I said. Their answer was: 'Why? What's so special about the euro? We don't know anything else! What was there to explain?' I regard that as one of the greatest successes of the introduction of the euro, that at least for my grandchildren it is nothing special any more. It is simply their money.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gasòliba i Böhm (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which I have the honour of representing, could not have come at a more appropriate time. This report is based on the one drawn up by the European Commission, assessing the first four years of the euro and also, as has been pointed out, on another report on the use of euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has been introduced in a very short time, but has proven its solidity and stability. The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Duisenberg, must be congratulated on the euro’s sound management and we must thank him, in his last appearance in plenary, and extend our best wishes for the future, hoping that he enjoys them in the company of his grandchildren, who have only known the euro as the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro, its increasing acceptance and its appreciation towards the dollar, inevitably lead us to consider its role at international level, which is the main theme of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Thessaloniki European Council, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, stated that working on the external representation of the euro is absolutely crucial. The report attempts to respond to this need articulated by President Prodi, and proposes principally that the euro should have a single representation in the international financial institutions, and also that this representation should be enhanced at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not go further, because we believe that there must be a broad consensus and, obviously, the relevant arrangements in line with this principle must be studied and adopted in the appropriate international forums. There is a suggestion, however, made by Mrs Peijs, to be specific, before her appointment as minister in the new Dutch government, which is to use the type of post that has already been adopted and proposed by the European Convention, of a European Minister for External Affairs. The same could apply to a Minister for European Economic and Monetary Affairs who would, at international level, represent the euro on the basis of a formula contained in a proposal from Ecofin, which the Commission has obviously accepted. This ‘Mr Euro’ or ‘Ms Euro’ would also hold the post of Vice-President of the European Commission. I repeat that this is a suggestion, for a post that has already been adopted and proposed in the Convention, and which appears to be accepted at political level, even by the European Council itself and we therefore believe it to be a valid alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">In an article that appeared recently in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, Martin Wolf said that the Eurozone will very soon be larger than the dollar zone and attributes this to the credibility and soundness of the economy and of the economies that are joining the Eurozone. Obviously, this solidity and credibility are the result of complying with the stability and growth pacts, which it is absolutely crucial to pursue and abide by. We refer to this aspect – compliance with and the need to comply with the stability and growth pacts – as a component and guarantee of the euro’s soundness, credibility and stability, and we study, as one would expect, the use of the euro at international level in various fields and, in particular, on the international financial markets, and its use by our new neighbours, including Russia and the Baltic States. We also refer to the euro’s potential for ensuring greater stability in the supply of raw materials which are extremely important, because of their dependence on the European economy. We believe that energy supply should be paid for in euros. We also refer to the growing number of central banks around the world that are increasing their euro reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I shall simply recall that in the report we also study some suggestions and propose a study to be undertaken by the European Central Bank and the central banks that are members of the euro zone, on some aspects of the use of notes and coins, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has already referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to focus my comments on two fundamental points made in this report. One of them concerns economic policies, while the other relates to problems of an institutional nature, to which he has paid rather more attention. With regard to economic policies, at Thessaloniki the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines were adopted and we hope the Ecofin Council will formally adopt these at its next meeting. The guidelines maintain the tone set by the Commission, including some of the comments made by this Parliament in the report presented by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, the proposal ratifies the broad lines on which we are all working: sound macroeconomic policies, which are crucial to increasing demand, growth and employment and to increasing the potential for growth, on the basis of the Lisbon conclusions. This implies a need to press ahead with policies of modernisation and structural change, and our main challenge at the moment is to set up and implement these policies. That is where I believe Parliament must play a crucial role, in this aspect of implementing policies, through its dialogue with the citizens and with the national Parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">As to economic governance, I wish to make two comments; firstly, the Eurogroup has played and continues to play a fundamental role. In our opinion, the recognition of its role in the Constitution should be welcomed, since this maintains its informal character. Nevertheless, the Commission regrets the fact that the idea of creating an Ecofin Council for the Eurozone has not been accepted. We believe that there is a whole set of formal decisions that must be adopted publicly by the countries of the Eurozone and that the existence of the Eurogroup is nevertheless not sufficient to resolve these problems. We welcome the fact that some progress has been made in the decisions that the Eurozone countries are to adopt, including in the framework of the current Ecofin. There are, however, some requests made by the Commission that have not been accepted and we do not believe that this will help the system to function more smoothly. Decisions such as those on the excess deficit procedure, the procedure of multilateral vigilance in the Eurozone or on the entry of Member States to the Eurozone should, in our opinion, be adopted, not by the Council in plenary, but by the Council that deals with the Eurozone. This point will continue to be debated and I hope that we can make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a final comment on the issue of external representation. At the Thessaloniki European Council, as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm has just said, emphasis was given to the importance of increasing the Union’s ability to act as a coherent and unified force in the international system. The need to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation and economic interdependence was also underlined. The effective and coherent representation of the Eurozone in this way is crucial. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that beyond raising the issue, little progress has been made on external representation.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the progress that has been made has basically been better advance coordination of strategic positions at international meetings, which has enabled us in several cases to put forward joint proposals, but not one common proposal. We must make more progress in this direction. I take note of your suggestion, which is not far-removed from another suggestion the Commission made to the Convention. We must be aware, however, of the technical, legal and institutional difficulties that the issue entails and in light of these, I believe it is crucial to demonstrate enormous political sensitivity, in order clearly to define what we want to achieve in future. For this reason, we in the Commission will continue to work with the Convention, trying, in the corrections to the final texts, in the part which is still being debated, to clarify some points. In any event, at the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission will attempt to put forward a vision that is more ambitious and even innovative, which will enable us to consolidate effective external representation of the Eurozone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate is a seamless continuation of the previous one. I believe that we should view all the arguments as a whole and not as an alternative to the report of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Right at the beginning of his explanatory statement, the rapporteur wrote the following: ‘Since its more than four years of existence, the euro has become the world's second leading currency’. The first reason, he says, is the size of the euro area economy, which accounts for around 16% of world GDP, in comparison with the United States' 21% and Japan's 8%. The second reason he refers to is the stability and growth orientation and economic and monetary union. Whilst his reasons are sound, these are of course also areas that we need to approach with great caution.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro area is growing. Since its inception we have already gained an additional member, Greece, and we must do our utmost to ensure that the Member States of the European Union are not divided into a eurozone and a non-eurozone, because the euro can make the single market our home market, and because we must do everything to strengthen the single market, to be better able to influence global political events and thus to increase the benefit to the Member States. This involves the new Member States meeting the Maastricht criteria, it involves strengthening the euro area, and it also involves adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and the communitarisation of national economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be our objective for all the Member States of the European Union also to be members of the euro area, because only then can we fully exploit the potential of the single market and the single currency. However, this political objective presupposes political will on the part of the Member States and compliance with the criteria. In Paragraph 11 we have very clearly spelt out what is necessary to achieve this, that is to say achieving the Lisbon strategy, promoting a culture of entrepreneurship, stronger small and medium-sized enterprises, creative and innovative fiscal reforms, with protectionism outlawed and research and development promoted. If we can stick to what we have agreed we can then make the euro area even stronger, both internally and externally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This phrase consists of congratulating the rapporteur on the report they have drawn up. I would not like my congratulations to Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, in this case, to imply that I am simply observing a Parliamentary formality.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm in particular, not only on the content of his report but also, above all, on his good choice of issues. Parliaments sometimes earn prestige not only by what is said within their walls but also by their choice of issues for debate: if these are topical and affect the citizens, they serve to bring the citizens and their political representatives closer together. Like Mr Karas, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for his flexibility towards the positions of the other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the euro is one of the most significant milestones in the process of European integration. Having a single currency represents a huge step towards achieving European unity, not only in economic terms, but also, I would say, in political terms. The Eurosceptics are right to fear the single currency, because no one can question the fact that participating in a common currency involves the greatest possible degree of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, therefore, think that the introduction of the euro has been important only in the economic field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the euro has enjoyed considerable success in the field of foreign trade: around one third of trade with third countries takes place in this currency. Furthermore, as we Europeans continue to use the same currency, we will start to feel more united with one another. For this very reason, it is the political and human dimension of the euro’s introduction that we should be worrying about – the ‘micro’ effects of the new currency. Concern about these effects, which citizens sometimes see as negative, obliges us to remedy them, inasmuch as we can, or, when this perception is not borne out by objective causes, to try to convince the public that its opinion does not match the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">This success cannot conceal the fact that there have been problems in introducing new notes and coins. Blame for this must be laid at the door of the Commission, the governments and European Central Bank; there may still be some issues that make citizens feel that some problems are the result of the euro’s introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the euro’s introduction cannot conceal some of its effects, which have damaged public opinion. In this context, the citizens’ perception is perhaps that the euro has played a major role in increasing inflation and in raising prices. The reality, however, is that, according to objective data, the euro has had much less influence than the citizens perceive to be the case. There is some basis for this perception because the so-called ‘rounding-up effect’ has had a fundamental impact on consumers’ shopping baskets and other essential goods, and on certain services. The necessary steps must, therefore, be taken to prevent this perception, which can have such damaging effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last thing I would wish to do is interfere in the internal debate of those countries that have not yet decided whether to join the Eurozone. I must remain on the sidelines of this internal debate but whilst remaining on the sidelines, I can still express the desire for them to join our common currency zone as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the introduction of the euro has been very successful. We have finally obtained a practical common European symbol. The euro is already the world’s second largest currency. It has strengthened European identity and bound the twelve countries together. Even if economic development is shaky, the euro has already shown positive economic advantages, strengthened trade and increased investments for the eurozone countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aspects, which was also addressed by Mr Berenguer Fuster and which has been discussed in connection with the introduction of the euro, is that of whether there have been price rises and, if so, unfair ones. Eurostat’s statistics clearly show that there was a very small, one-off effect of between 0.1 and 0.2% upon the introduction of the euro. Within some sectors of the economy, or in certain industries, there were, however, significant price rises, particularly in certain countries. The overall effect for those inhabiting the eurozone has, however, been very small. It is good that we should now take up this issue and ask the Commission to investigate it further. One thing we have found is that pro-active consumers and two-currency price labelling have prevented underhand price rises. Let us not, however, be deceived into thinking that the price rises were higher than they in actual fact were, and let us not make use of that argument in debates, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The big advantage of the euro is, however, that it has provided economic stability in politically and economically very difficult times. In spite of great unrest in the world, partly due to the Iraq war, European currencies have not tossed around on a stormy monetary sea, as in actual fact happened in the nineties. The euro has provided stability and security. That is a fact that should be mentioned more often. This should be emphasised in the discussion of the euro’s advantages and disadvantages, particularly in those EU countries that at present enjoy the stability of the euro without participating fully in the cooperation and so without accepting full responsibility, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we can also see the limits to these benefits: the short-lived expansion phase from 1997 to 2000 and the current economic stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">It was Jacques Delors who said that the euro was not enough. He asked for strong coordination of economic policies. We have not yet achieved this, and we are now desperately in need of a European economic policy. I approve of Mr Gasòliba’s report, which is a move in this direction, and which expresses the desire for, among other things, the development of public and private investment, of human capital, of research, and of the mobility and qualifications of workers. The Convention should have drawn up the tools to achieve these objectives. It has not done so and that is one of its great failings. We have not really been able to construct the euro group within the framework of the work of the Convention. Even though Member States could, as they say, take additional measures in terms of major economicpolicies, they have neither the fiscal nor the budgetary means to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the monetary policy which was mentioned just now, and about which complimentary words were spoken, neither anticipated nor understood the reversal in the world economy and was very late in reacting to it, which demonstrates the difficulty that we have in imagining our position within the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to talk of structural reforms – and these are certainly essential – but, as Mr Delors also said, competition is not enough: we must build up cooperation and solidarity between us if we want to have a successful economy and play a role in the governance of the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Without this willingness and these concepts, let us at least work towards institutional reforms, let us try to equip ourselves with institutional tools. You have proposed a single representation of the euro zone, and have aired the idea of a minister for economic affairs who would play a role that was at once both internal and external and who would operate as part of the Commission. Obviously I can only support these proposals, which are a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a political level, as a federalist and a supporter of Catalan independence, I ought to be pleased at the relative success of the euro. For Europeans, the euro reinforces the evidence of the process of integration of which it is the symbol. For Catalans, whether French or Spanish, it means that we once again have a common currency, which has not been the case since the disastrous Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that I am not entirely happy, however, first of all because this common currency is not as common as all that. Some people do not have any of it, or at least not enough of it. For instance, in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, some 5% of families are living in a situation of extreme poverty, in other words with an income of less than EUR 240 per person per month. Secondly, I am not entirely happy because I would like Europe to have a stronger and more human symbol of unity than a unit of currency. In celebrating the euro, are we not rather like the chosen people who, forgetting their destiny, began to worship the golden calf?</p>
<p class="contents">This earth, which has been so copiously watered with the blood and tears of our fratricidal wars, so distressingly covered with the ashes of our tragic genocides, deserves, I believe, stronger and less abstract signs of its humanity and its unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the euro has, without a doubt, been an extremely valuable development, and not just in economic and financial terms. It is worth pointing out once again that the euro area is the second largest economic area in the world. However, the single currency has also contributed to a small revolution in terms of culture and identity, so to speak. Indeed, the circulation and use of the single currency have given consumers something practical in common and have thus helped them to feel more like European citizens for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these same citizens, who exceeded all expectations and sailed through the transition from individual national currencies to the European single currency, are now demanding that the Community institutions carry out careful surveillance to prevent unjustified – and, in many cases, very substantial – increases in the price of both goods and services. Above all, as has been pointed out in the report too, these citizens are calling upon us to introduce minor measures in the future, effective, practical measures which will make their everyday lives easier. In particular, the citizens are calling upon us to introduce EUR 1 banknotes or even, in some cases, 50-cent banknotes, as well as for greater availability of low-value notes, especially in cash machines. I believe that these demands are absolutely legitimate and very reasonable too. I also believe that it is genuinely important that Parliament makes every effort to persuade the relevant Community institutions to comply with the demands of the European citizens, which, although small, are extremely important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we can be a little more precise than that: the real advantages exist and have, moreover, been known from the beginning. For example, the disappearance of fluctuations in exchange rates between countries in the euro zone, which has no doubt saved us from a few crises in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the disadvantages exist too. These can be found, in particular, in a growth rate that has halved and an unemployment rate that has doubled in the euro zone compared with the non-euro zone. No doubt there are several reasons for this difference, but one of those reasons is very definitely the inflexibility resulting from uniform interest rates and exchange rates, when these are applied to economies whose needs remain very different.</p>
<p class="contents">Another disadvantage, which rarely occurs, is the lack of incentive for structural reforms, which is the result of making responsibilities mutual. Previously, poor national management could cause a monetary crisis, which would require corrective measures. Now, the responsibilities of saint and sinner countries are blurred, thanks to the single currency, so that certain parties can put off reforms as long as the euro still has credit. Admittedly the plan was that the disappearance of the disciplines of the exchange market would be compensated for by the disciplines of the stability pact, but it has now been proved that these administrative disciplines are not enough to replace those of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the strengthening of overall economic coordination and a European budget drawn up in accordance with federal principles, which the report calls for, we must not count on these too much in the immediate future, as is shown by the somewhat unsatisfactory results obtained on this chapter in the Convention. Moreover, it would not be in accordance with what was agreed at Maastricht. In other words, Madam President, the ship of the euro zone is afloat, but it cannot be piloted, and no one knows where it is heading. I hope it is not heading towards a superstate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, as we know, the euro's exchange rate has followed a roller coaster course. At present, it has returned to its starting point. But, basically speaking, we Europeans should not be too concerned about the euro exchange rate, because no one can explain or even predict short-term exchange rate fluctuations between one day and six months. We should instead be focussing on economic problems, which are more important, and leave exchange rate trends to the foreign currency markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if public acceptance of the euro has increased, the most recent polls carried out by opinion research organisations indicate, for example, that in many Germans’ thinking, the Deutschmark is still very much alive. That this should be so was, however, totally predictable and should by no means be seen in a negative light. The increasing public acceptance of the euro is a gradual process and can in no way diminish the impact of this key event in monetary policy in the history of the continent of Europe. As far as withdrawals from cash machines are concerned, I support the rapporteur's view that we need more smaller-denomination banknotes, that is, 5-euro and 10-euro notes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, rather more critical about the idea of setting up a working party to investigate the need for a 1-euro banknote. The most recent opinion polls confirm that in Germany at least there is widespread opposition to this idea. There, for example, 79% of the population clearly rejects this low denomination note, with only 16% in favour of introducing it. Even if opinion polls are not the be-all and end-all, this result nevertheless seems to clearly confirm that the public, at least in Germany, does not see any need for such a note. In short, the answer to the question ‘Do we need a 1 euro note alongside the 1 euro coin?’ is very definitely ‘no’. The euro denominations currently in circulation are fine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the single currency was a huge success, but although the new notes and coins have brought with them widespread satisfaction, the same cannot be said of the processing of payments in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro has actually been our currency since 1999. For four and a half years the euro has been the currency of 11 Member States, whose national currencies became nothing more than submultiples still in circulation. Throughout this period, however, the European banking system persistently refused to recognise this new state of affairs. There were 12 countries with the same currency, but the banks carried on operating as if each country in the zone were financially autonomous. The euro payment zone did not really exist. It was not until a year ago that electronic banking cards could be used all over the euro zone as well as in the countries in which they were actually issued. It was not until this week, moreover, that it became possible to carry out bank transfers under the same conditions as those that apply within each Member State. Furthermore, while this is an extremely beneficial step for citizens and for small and medium-sized enterprises trading in the euro zone, the limit of EUR 12 500 per transaction is ridiculous and unjustifiable. Since the technical infrastructure allowing single-currency transfers from one country to another is in place, and since the cost is negligible, this being a virtual transaction processed by computers, why has such a low limit been set? A EUR 12 500 transaction costs the same as a EUR 50 000 transaction (which will be allowed from 2006), or a transaction of EUR 100 000 or more. I would go as far as to say that forcing a company to perform 10 small transactions of EUR 12 500 in order to make up one payment of EUR 125 000 only serves to increase costs for companies and banks.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I will state my conviction that the euro zone must be made to work effectively by reducing banking commissions to the rates charged at national level. Do not forget that the euro zone is our country where currency is concerned. What does the Commission plan to do to improve the processing of payments in the euro zone? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro is not only a means of payment. Instead, it is part of an economic policy and an important key element of EMU policy. If the euro is to function, a lot of things are clearly required. Mr Gasòliba i Böhm indicated a number of them in his report, and other factors were also addressed in the debate. Much more harmonisation and coordination of economic policy is required. Mr Gasòliba I Böhm goes so far as to talk about federal budgetary principles. What is required is coordination on tax policy, a structural policy and greater mobility for the European labour force. In short, a range of measures may be taken to reduce the large differences that exist between national economies. For example, it would be possible for Ireland and Germany to have the same policy – two countries that, at present, quite clearly have a need for different policy approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gasòliba I Böhm talks about the need for institutions. If the matter were to be summarised, there could even perhaps be talk of the need for a European state power in the economic sphere. He proposes having an economics tsar when it comes to the eurozone’s relations with the surrounding world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely all this that gives rise to such a lot of scepticism towards the euro project in my own country of Sweden. We fear it would mean the small economies being integrated into a European economy in such a way that they would be unable themselves to exercise control and that would not offer any democratic guarantees, either. There is therefore considerable hesitation, and more than half of the Swedish population will presumably vote ‘no’ in the forthcoming referendum. That is also why the Swedish referendum will be followed with such great interest in the candidate countries. So far, only 12 of what will soon be a total of 25 Member States are in the eurozone. The 13 countries that are still outside it have obvious doubts. People are aware of the ups and downs of the German debate and of the problems there are, and they think it is better to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate, however, that there may one day be a need for lower denomination notes, especially if economic problems were to arise in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In purely practical terms, it is now clear that the introduction of the euro has been extremely successful. The latest Eurobarometer indicates that 75% of citizens in the eurozone countries are satisfied. Mr Gasòliba i Böhm certainly draws attention to a number of unnecessary price rises upon the actual transition to the euro but, overall, we now know that these were fairly modest and that they have since become less pronounced. It is quite obvious that we can anticipate the eurozone in the future creating conditions for lower price rises, which is perhaps what is most important of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless think that the most interesting thing about this report is the observation that the euro is in the process of becoming a world currency, together with the demands for a feasibility study designed further to strengthen that role, for we can see how the dollar even now dominates in the world at large. In particular, international trade, especially in oil and other raw materials, has for a long time taken place in dollars. Use of the euro and its importance as a currency are increasing all the time, however. I believe that, in the future, the euro may very well be able to compete with the dollar as a world currency. If we could achieve this, it would be important from both economic and political points of view. There is a lot to be said, for example, for the possibility of one day fixing oil prices in euros. I know that my colleague, Mr Goebbels, is among those who have addressed that idea in various reports. It would be in the interests of the oil-producing Gulf States because more and more of these countries’ goods are imported from the eurozone. It would also, however, be in the interests of European consumers because the price fluctuations we have for oil and petrol, dependent upon the rate of the dollar, would disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, the debate is fully under way prior to the autumn referendum on introducing the euro. I believe that the prospect of the euro, together with an enlarged EU and EMU, possibly offsetting US power and the dollar’s world dominance is one of the most important factors that could make the Swedes vote yes in the referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One can also conclude that the euro, which is over-valued, is starting to amplify the difficulties of our economies, namely the sluggishness of growth and of internal demand, the handicapping of our exports, the threat of deflation, and a dogmatic stability pact which imposes a procyclical budgetary policy. Who will dare to put a figure, in terms of jobs, on the cost of the single currency and the delays and excuses of the European Central Bank?</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, which serves as your model in so many fields, should also serve as a model in matters concerning economic and monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve has other things on its mind than how to beat an inflation rate that is little more than 2%. The United States preserves its growth, which is already considerably more dynamic than ours, by issuing dollars. It uses them to finance not only its deficits but its wars as well, and it also uses them as the basis for its political domination.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should we not do the same with the euro? The rapporteur states that the advantages of the single currency far outweigh its disadvantages.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghilardotti (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today slots perfectly into European policy on equal opportunities, which, as we know, has two basic branches: specific measures benefiting women and gender mainstreaming, or the incorporation of the perspective of gender equality into all stages and levels of public policy by all the actors involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender budgeting is the application of the principle of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process. As we are all aware, budgets are not gender-neutral, but reflect the way in which power is distributed within society. Whenever they define revenue and expenditure policies, public budgetary authorities at all levels are taking policy decisions. Budgets are not merely economic tools but, in fact, key instruments with which political authorities shape a society's model of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution and prioritise the measures to be taken in respect of policies and the needs of their own citizens. The impact this has is not the same on men and women. The way in which public budgets are normally drawn up tends to ignore the differences – in terms of roles and responsibilities – between men and women, and, in most cases, the indicators and data used fail to make any gender distinction. Although they are presented as neutral economic instruments, public budgets, in actual fact, reflect and thus reproduce the socio-economic disparities already present in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Analysing budgetary policies on the basis of the different impacts they have on men and women and adjusting them accordingly serves to ensure that public budgets meet appropriate criteria in terms of fairness and cost-effectiveness. In order to be not merely fair but also efficient, public spending must help to promote the development and exploit the potential of all sections of society. It is therefore a matter of adopting an economic and social approach based on the principle that, even in an open and globalised market economy, economic and social development are considered inseparable and interconnected. An economy cannot be competitive, dynamic and healthy in the long term unless the productive, commercial and financial processes are backed up by a stable, cohesive and fair society in which human rights, resources and capacities are properly developed. The strengthening, modernisation and reorganisation of public intervention, and hence budgetary policies, with a view to social development are, in fact, an absolutely essential intangible investment in capacities, empowerment and new resources and opportunities for economies wishing to be dynamic and competitive through being knowledge-based, in accordance with the objective set by the European Council in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is the first time that Parliament has discussed gender budgeting, it is by no means a new concept. The Platform for Action drawn up at Beijing at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women specifically refers to it; an experts' working group has been set up within the Council of Europe's Directorate-General for Human Rights; the Commission itself, after the conference organised by the Belgian Presidency, set up a working group of experts; but, above all, numerous experiments have been carried out in Eastern countries, starting with Australia, which adopted this instrument – like many developing countries, moreover – as early as 1984, and there have been interesting experiments carried out within the European Union too for some years now at both national and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the specific objectives of the report? Firstly, raising awareness among the public and political and economic actors at all levels. Disseminating information on the gender budgeting strategy and method among the institutions of the European Union and the Member States. Calling on the Commission, which has already expressed its support, to produce and distribute as widely as possible an information brochure on gender budgeting. Involving the actors operating in the Community at all levels in the building of budgets. Most importantly, indicating an action framework for the implementation of gender budgeting, providing for bottom-up democratic participation and the involvement of organised individuals, NGOs and women's associations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Madam President, with this point: wherever, especially at local level, experiments of this kind are already underway, they have also served to wipe away the indifference and detachment we see today at all levels in relationships between the citizens and the public authorities. This is an instrument which brings great participation as well as great justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission indeed first raised the issue at a technical seminar held in October 2001 and in 2002 the Consultative Committee on Equal Opportunities was instructed to look at current experiences and to study how Member States view the gender perspective and how they propose to integrate it into their budgets. This committee delivered an opinion which is available to this Parliament, distributed by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Clearly, on the basis of this document, the committee is willing to draw up the pamphlet to which you referred and which could be useful in providing this information.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have some good practices in place in various fields, such as the European Employment Strategy, social protection, science and research and cooperation development and – perhaps the most interesting example – in the Structural Funds. All of this demonstrates that gender equality is being addressed more effectively in the current programmes than in the previous period.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, much remains to be done, but we are continuing to make progress in this field. The Commission Communication on integrating gender equality into the programming documents for the Structural Funds recommends that the Member States clearly indicate which funds are allocated to specific equality-related actions. The Member States will provide us with the relevant information, with precise indicators, as part of this year’s review.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are also being urged to ensure that actions pursued under the Structural Funds use gender impact assessments and statistics broken down by gender and, at the same time, the Commission emphasises that specific funds, in most of the programmes, should be maintained and even increased for activities dedicated to ensuring gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to develop methodologies and tools to implement the integration of gender into the budget, but this means continuing with our discussions on exchanging experiences and all cooperating with one another. Consequently its report on integrating the gender perspective makes an, in our opinion, enormously useful contribution to improving the principle of gender integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The fruitful cooperation between Parliament, Member States and the Commission must remain in place and be stepped up if we are to achieve the aims that we all wish to attain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the Commissioner says that a lot is already happening at European level, I view this report rather as a start and a stimulus for building on the little that is already happening. People may say that there is a lot of expertise, or at least some, but, to be honest, I have to say that I have yet to see much evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are there calls for gender budgeting? It is because a number of items in the budgets of Member States and the European Union are largely only benefiting half of the population. I shall give two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">It is common knowledge that, when it comes to allocating resources for scientific research into health care, a good deal of research is conducted on half of the population: the males and not the females.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example is as follows. When resources are given for stimulating democratisation and respect for human rights in developing countries, it frequently happens that these resources are principally used for the benefit of one half of the population and not the other. That is why it is expressly requested that we perhaps start with an analysis of a number of budgetary items that are very gender-sensitive, where something really could be done. If this could be carried out in consultation with the Member States, I think that something positive could result. It is indeed good to have a brochure, but we are actually still only at the stage of developing a mechanism. The development of a mechanism requires the building-up of a great deal of expertise. I give my support to the Commission, and to Mrs Ghilardotti, and I hope that this own-initiative report bears fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The promotion of the idea of gender budgeting is obviously not calling for the creation of separate funding headings, nor does it aspire to more financial resources for women. What we want is for the specific consequences on the economic and social life of both sexes to be evaluated and, of course, for the budgets to be restructured so that, through them, gender equality can be promoted instead of being undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is becoming more and more understood that macroeconomic policy can reduce or widen the gap between the two sexes in relation to financial resources, economic independence, education and health care. For example, the health budget should take account of the specific needs which arise from the different physiology of the two sexes and the different health problems faced by the two sexes. In other words, the male cannot be used as the measure for everything. I regret that the European Commission does not have at its disposal either methods or reliable statistics for analysing the budget by gender.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that all the committees of the European Parliament should apply gender budgeting in all their budgets. Finally, it is also important for there to be transparency and control mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very serviceable document that really is to be welcomed. It gives concrete shape to what many are talking about, that is to say gender mainstreaming, but which so few are attempting to convert into practical politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to hear that the Commission has the same problems as the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Ever since the Beijing Conference in 1995, we have talked about statistics broken down by gender. Statistics of this kind have still not been produced in our Member States, and nor of course have they been produced by the Commission. We have also assessed in previous debates how the structural funds are distributed by gender. I am not usually particularly enamoured of the Commission’s various propaganda documents, but I really do hope in this case that an attempt will at least be made to produce a document on this issue that can be distributed in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Committee on Budgets has not itself taken the initiative that Mrs Ghilardotti has so creditably taken. All the institutions have undertaken to take account of gender mainstreaming in all areas. Now that, hopefully, many from the Committee on Budgets are present, I really do hope that this initiative will be taken to heart and practical measures continue to be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, some sober correction is in order.</p>
<p class="contents">The two genders must be valued equally: I am an outright supporter of this. However, this resolution smacks of an ideology that wants to forcefully combat one objectionable form of oppression by introducing another undesirable form of dictatorship or collective thinking. For, ultimately, the equality ideology does not value women as women. It does not give them their due. On the contrary, women must become the same as men. They will be forced to be the same. Where have I heard those words before? It must be understood that I am against any unworthy treatment of women.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to banish from society the problem indicated, we must not take as our starting point a model based on confrontation between the two genders, but instead set to work in accordance with a model based on harmony. This is the way God the creator intended it when he created humankind – man and woman as a unity of two parts that complement each other. Unfortunately, this harmonious relationship has been thoroughly disturbed on account of humankind's refusal to recognise God or his authority, instead insisting on being its own boss. Unfortunately, there is no place for this original truth in the equality ideology. As a result, it does not rise above the jealousy-promoting confrontation model, which involves the division of power and money; everyone the same, as if men and women will be happier as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution tramples on the subsidiarity principle. It calls for studies and reports from the European Commission that require an enormous amount of work, including from the Member States, in order to achieve an ideological and ultimately inhumane objective. In our opinion, it would be more just and fair to call for attention to the position of families and the extent to which government policy and budgetary policy in the European Union are family-friendly. After all, the individualistic spirit exuded by this report has very negative implications for the future of our societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To my mind, that is a very important distinction, and one that we should not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender budgeting does not involve creating separate budgets for men and women, but it does mean working to ensure that funding is distributed fairly and efficiently. Contrary to what we are often told, public budgets are not gender-neutral; in terms of both income and expenditure they have different impacts on men and women. We want to highlight these differences and take account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic, social, and societal terms. That is why we need a budget analysis. Such an analysis means investigating the impact of budgets on women, and on tax systems, that is to say different types of taxation. How do women perceive cuts and how are they affected by them? The answer is: very often more than men are.</p>
<p class="contents">To make gender budgeting possible, we need transparency, consultation and joint decision-making. A group of highly committed Austrian women have written a book entitled ‘Women, Power and Budgets – Public Finances from a Gender Perspective’. I can recommend this to you as a starting point, and it could also provide a basis for the information leaflet the Commission has promised us. That leaflet should be widely published, easily accessible and go hand in hand with an information campaign. Statements like the ones you have just heard should then be a thing of the past.</p>

The rapporteur has explained that countries both outside and inside Europe have already been applying the practices of gender budgeting. Therefore I hope, Commissioner, that we will keenly support this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, to the Member who believes that we are being ideological when we discuss this question, that this is an economic question. If I take as an example the issue of pensions, which affects most countries in Europe and, in the last few months, France in particular, gender budgeting enables us to make a diagnosis of the situation. We discover, for example, that while the difference in wages between men and women is 25%, that difference rises to 47% as soon as retirement age is reached. That is the sort of diagnosis that this study enables us to carry out.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this diagnosis is not sufficient, because the pessimists will say that that is going to cost us money. Economic equality between the sexes does cost money, whether it is professional equality or equality of retirement pensions, as is the case with many other subjects. I should like to remind those pessimists that it is possible to produce a different analysis of inequality between men and women, namely that it is economic inequality between men and women that costs money. A better analysis and a better practice of equality in financial matters would make it possible to reduce a cost rather than to increase it. I say this for the benefit of those who think that we are being ideological. They are wrong, because we are also thinking in economic terms when we consider this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Gender<span class="italic"> </span>budgeting is a relatively recent idea, which was developed at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. In the context of gender mainstreaming, it involves analysing public budgets to assess their differing impacts on men and women, and to raise awareness among political and economic actors – which we have ample opportunity to do today. Discrimination very soon becomes apparent when figures talk and we see that only 6% of the Structural Funds are geared towards helping women. Let me give you another example from the EU Budget: the forest protection programme has a budget of EUR 52 million, whereas the programme for the protection of children, young people and women is allocated only EUR 41 million, a clear 20% less.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities hopes, by means of this report, to stimulate a debate that will expose the inequality and discrimination in the Budget. But we need instruments to achieve that, and this point is addressed to you personally, Commissioner Solbes Mira: please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13, which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender, which will at last give us a significant instrument.</p>

I ask the powers-that-be <span class="bold"></span> or the great and the good <span class="bold"></span> to do something so that in future voting time starts on time, as opposed to the rigmarole that seems to happen every part-session with the time slipping by.</p>

An important reason for this is that the preamble distorts the history of Europe: it deliberately omits to make explicit mention of Christianity, even though this has had a profound influence on, and been decisive in shaping, the culture and politics of all the countries of Europe for centuries. A good ‘European house’ cannot do without sound foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council’s conclusions regarding the Middle East, both parties are called to account on their obligations. It is a shame that the EU has not always been so resolute in propagating this viewpoint. The pronouncements on terrorist organisations such as Hamas <span class="bold"></span> their relations with countries in the region, and the financing of their abominable actions <span class="bold"></span> do not mince words. This kind of firm language is unfortunately lacking in the conclusions regarding Iran and those regarding Lebanon, with a view to the agreements the EU wishes to enter into with these countries. This reveals the inconsistency that is so characteristic of the EU's position, and which makes it an unpredictable party as far as Israel and other countries in the region are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Open internal borders force the Member States to cooperate in the field of asylum and migration. There was a lot to be done about this in Thessaloniki, but little was achieved. The British plan for registration centres and reception in the region was not supported by a majority in the Council. A pilot project that may be started up is the paltry consolation prize. It is high time that the Council came up with results, so that the EU meets its moral obligation towards political refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, this document reveals the new threats: terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, rogue states or states that are failing, and organised crime. It demonstrates that, because of increased interdependence, destabilisations that are far away in geographical terms may nonetheless have dangerous repercussions for us, whether direct or indirect. Finally, it emphasises that often ‘pre-emptive engagement’ (which is not necessarily military) ‘can avoid more serious problems in the future’.</p>
<p class="contents">These considerations could provide a good basis for justifying, after the event, the intervention in Iraq, which provoked the anger of the Chairman of the Communist Group. Yet I, for my part, applaud this attempt at lucidity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I think that the High Representative’s report underestimates the future threat posed by increasing and uncontrolled migratory flows. Moreover, this text appears to be somewhat unrealistic about the possibilities, in Europe, of a unified foreign policy without a substantial reduction in democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A campaign must be launched to raise awareness among the general public, governments and national parliaments. Particularly important is the production of a guide describing the tools and methods for introducing the gender perspective into public budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I agree with the idea of setting up a European network of organisations and experts active in the field of gender budgeting, to be linked into the network of parliamentary committees for equal opportunities. This will allow the development and dissemination of good methods and practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament, sitting in their ivory tower, can imagine what they want to imagine. The reality is very different. By giving the major industrial and financial groups an increasingly free hand, by destroying public services or attacking social protection, the Member States of the European Union are not reducing inequalities: they are entrenching them even deeper.</p>
<p class="contents">By refusing to put a stop to dismissals, by favouring moderation in wage claims, and by reducing the amount of pensions, their action is aggravating the misfortunes suffered by women, who are more often than men the victims of unemployment, insecurity and forced part-time working.</p>

There are also, however, methods which show budgets according to major function, according to programme or broken down in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1995, in the interests of seeking to achieve equality between men and women, it has been proposed that budgets should be drawn up on a sexual basis. This is known as gender budgeting, or budgeting according to sex, which is intended to respond to two questions. The first question is how the budget expenditure should be shared between women and men, in other words who gets the money, and the second question is who should pay, in other words who shoulders the tax burden.</p>
<p class="contents">This brave vision must be expanded to include even more justice. We need generational budgeting. Which generations pay the taxes? Is it young people, retired people, working people or old people? Which generations gain the most advantage from public expenditure? Above all, however, we must have class budgeting, or category budgeting. Which social categories shoulder the tax burden? Is it the wage earners, or the holders of movable capital incomes?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we come to the great taboo, the question of who profits from the budget credits. Is it the rich or the poor? Is it the middle classes, old people, small farmers, the small man or the big man? This is a question about justice. It is a social question rather than a hormonal one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This particularly applies in the case of long-distance traffic. This traffic crosses national borders, so responsibility for its safety and regulation is shared by more than one country. Previously, something like this would have led to plans for the creation of a single European railway company first of all, and then a single European aviation company with a single European air-traffic safety system. Of course, those monopolies would then have to be under democratic control, in order to prevent abuses of power, wastefulness and nepotism.</p>
<p class="contents">The neoliberal ideology has since arrived. Not only service provision, but also maintenance of support infrastructures and monitoring of safety can be handed over to competing undertakings. Work funded with public finances is to be allocated by means of competition, and existing jobs are no longer secure. This causes great unease in those who have to do this work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that national borders and military zones lose their importance in the course of the organisation of aviation safety, but that does not mean that the means currently being proposed are the best. It was a surprise  a pleasant surprise  to hear Commissioner de Palacio yesterday evening inform us in this debate that this proposal is by no means intended for privatisation or liberalisation.

<p class="contents">The image of food additives among consumers has deteriorated, even taking account of risk assessments and the concept of the acceptable daily intake. Today, there are scientific and technological means of improving production methods, and of forewarning us against misuse. This guarantees the precautionary principle. Tighter labelling and packaging regulations are needed in order to guarantee that the necessary information is included. For these reasons, we agree with the rapporteur. The Commission should carry out a general evaluation of the use of food additives, basing future authorisations on three criteria: technological need, a high level of protection for human health, and labelling which does not mislead the consumer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against the backdrop of enlargement, this budget promotes greater economic, social and territorial cohesion. On the other hand, it offers a very limited increase in appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to comment here on some of the financial provisions relating to agriculture and fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the appreciable increase in allocations, especially for rural development, although that increase is mainly directed at the candidate countries. Also to be welcomed are the budgetary efforts dedicated to health protection, consumers and food safety, not forgetting the environmental criteria needed for high-quality agriculture. I give my full support to the creation of a special budgetary heading for farmers affected by emergencies and calamities such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever and other diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the common agricultural policy, this budget provides a relative increase in the amounts allocated to fisheries. I can only disagree, however, with the appreciable cuts made in the research budget and the structural funds linked to this sector. Strengthening the control and implementation of each Member State’s quotas is, therefore, desirable.

This is due, of course, to the budget chapter on technological research and development, which is a priority given the EU’s weaknesses in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a downward trend in terms of commitment implementation for areas of social policy, especially for the titles relating to the social dimension and employment as well as education and youth, even though these priority areas were already underfunded.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this situation, apart from a lack of political will, include bureaucracy, a lack of transparency and the inflexibility of spending regulations. The poor implementation argument cannot, of course, be used to justify cuts in sensitive areas. It is unacceptable to suggest that allocations to the social dimension and employment are unnecessary, at a time when unemployment is on the increase in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the rapporteur did not specifically address the fisheries question, especially the reconversion of the fleet which used to fish in Morocco waters and the lines relating to social dialogue with the sector. That would have been useful, bearing in mind the planned reduction of the preliminary draft budget for 2004 and the Council’s vagueness about funding for the reform of the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, therefore, with a sense of grave disquiet that I agree with the conclusions of this report, which draws attention once again to the problem of funds that are committed and not used. This is especially worrying since a part of those funds falls under the N+2 rule, which states that funds committed must be used by the Member States within two years of the initial allocation, or the funds will be forfeited. This situation becomes even more unacceptable and disgusting when it occurs in the implementation of the Structural Funds and in the internal policies of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore lend my support to the transparent, frequent and detailed presentation of sums cancelled, annulled or forfeited because they have not been used, as well as an assessment of the financial impact of those losses.

<p class="contents">The main concern of the people of Chechnya is not the fight against terrorism, but rather the fight against military occupation and the fight to improve their living conditions. These are atrocious as a result of Russian bombardments. Unemployment, which is already massive in the Russian Federation, owing to ultra-liberal policies, is made even worse in Chechnya and in the Caucasus by the demands of the military. Moreover, it is curious that the ad hoc delegation has not reported these facts to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace in Chechnya and the search for a political solution require the opening up of direct negotiations between the representatives of President Maskhadov and the Russian authorities. The end of military conflict can only be based on an official cease-fire and the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, he was clearly critical of the policies of the Russian Government and advocated a peaceful and humanitarian approach for the future. I do not think that I was alone in finding the word ‘stabilisation’ somewhat provocative, although I know that Mr Markov did not intend it to be, and now himself agrees that he should not use that word again as it gives rise to misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">Terms such as ‘stability’ and ‘reconstruction’ are often used by occupying powers wishing to gain support for their continuing occupation. The terminology used creates the impression that the conflict is over and that it goes without saying that Chechnya has a future as an autonomous part of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the conflict is still going on, that the referendum is seen by the majority of Chechens as an instrument of the military occupying powers, and that, on the basis of the assurances of the late General Lebed, there must be negotiations between the Chechen State structures arising from earlier elections and the Russian State claiming this region. In this connection, I can only support the resolution of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, although it unfortunately lacks a reference to the abduction of Arjan Erkel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of conducting a genuinely critical analysis of the implementation of monetary policy, the same old arguments are repeated, regardless of the economic climate. It is no surprise, then, that this report should begin with the words ‘[c]ongratulates once again the ECB for a successful introduction [of the euro]’, and concludes cheerfully ‘that the ECB reacted correctly to economic and financial developments’. All this is always packaged in the dogmas of service, support for the Stability Pact and flexibility of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a rigid monetary policy means that adjustments made to overcome economic crises are reflected in salaries and employment, affecting internal demand and increasing inequality, poverty, and social exclusion. One cannot help but notice that the present climate of recession in the EU, and the disparities between inflation rates, demonstrate that a single monetary policy cannot respond effectively to the needs of Member States at different stages of economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore insist once more on the need for an in-depth review of the guidelines for monetary and budgetary policy. Their inflexibility has not only contributed to a failure to seize on the potential for economic growth in the last few years, but is also primarily responsible for the current recession and concomitant increase in unemployment. That is why we voted against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also exposes a black hole in monetary union: no one knows exactly what the exchange rate target for the euro is. It is certainly not up to the ECB to set this target, because the bank’s sole task is to maintain price stability. The call for a wide-ranging study of the euro’s development confirms that the ECB itself does not appear to be taking much interest in this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This acknowledged and even proclaimed ignorance confirms that our analysis of the euro is correct: this is not an instrument designed to support an economic policy that is better coordinated and more favourable to employment. It is basically a tool for the economic police, intended to put pressure on salaries and social expenditure. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that this report, like the Gasòliba i Böhm report, is insistent on calling for the strictest orthodoxy, particularly in budgetary matters. Far from deploring the breaches of the Stability Pact, we consider that its principles are both inapplicable in practice and profoundly damaging in their effects. This is why we have voted against these two reports, which do nothing but compulsively restate plans that the economic situation has long since proven to be irrelevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whereas this type of bank used to be nationalised in order to enable greater political control over policy, politics is now being left behind. Interest rates, exchange rates, the implications for vulnerable regions, relations with the United States of America, and the position of the developing world are thus largely being decided outside parliamentary democracy. This also applies to the influence of the ECB and the Stability and Growth Pact on pensions, social security and the level of public service provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Blokland, rightly shows that the success or failure of the euro should not only be assessed in terms of the speed of introduction of the euro banknotes and coins at the start of 2002, but also in terms of price increases for the provision of services. I will gladly support him in his endeavours to have inflation forecasts, the influence of Member States' governments, and especially reporting on all meetings of the Governing Council published, including dissenting opinions and the balance of votes, and the obtaining of greater influence over the composition of the Governing Council on the part of Parliament. This is the only way we can prevent the ECB from developing into an instrument that is at odds with the majority of the inhabitants of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that this time the ‘courageous’ rapporteur dares to decry the fact that the introduction of the euro has resulted in what he modestly calls ‘effects’ on inflation. By the same token, the ECB is asked to keep an eye on the speed at which the markets react to or disregard its decisions on monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the ‘negative’ aspects of a report, which otherwise delivers a eulogy to the ECB’s activities in the guise of an analysis.</p>

I proposed such a report, incidentally, in my motion for a resolution (B5-640/2002) on the effects of the introduction of the euro, which is annexed to today’s report. While this report emphasises the success of the entire operation and insists on wider powers for the Eurozone, it also expresses disappointment with the inflationary pressures of the changeover to the euro, particularly in the services sector, and calls for an investigation into financial irregularities, just as I did in my resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the ECB recognise that the impact was greater than the 0.2% predicted but considerably smaller than the effects experienced by consumer organisations and than the information on inflation reported by some national central banks suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the report discusses developments in bank charges and commissions in the euro zone. A full assessment is needed to investigate the introduction of excessive increases, especially for domestic payments, and illegal charges on crossborder payments. Such charges penalise consumers and increase the cost of transactions. Banks cannot expect consumers and SMEs to meet the cost of lost foreign exchange revenues. I therefore welcome the fact that my amendment has been adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears almost impossible for both Germany and France, the large Member States that have taken the initiative for the euro, as well as for southern Member States with a weaker economy, to observe the Stability Pact's strict requirements. Low taxation combined with the discharging of public debts and the prevention of new budgetary shortages has disastrous effects on social security, public services and the problem-solving capacity of the government in general.</p>
<p class="contents">There will soon be no more money available for everything in which democracy requires the government to play an active role. Weak areas become increasingly more dependent on the EU’s structural funds, cohesion funds and the common agricultural policy, and here too, less and less funding will be available, proportionately speaking, in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to want to avoid price increases coinciding with the euro's introduction in the new Member States of the euro zone. In fact, price increases are already a reality, because invariably, the payment of luxury goods and services is already being required in euros instead of the national currencies that are still valid there for the time being. The abolition of small currencies, which is also advocated, will in practice lead to yet further price increases because figures will be rounded up by quite a large margin. It is for these reasons that I reject this measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his opinion, the euro is so successful that a single representative for the euro zone should even be appointed for the international political institutions!</p>

I tabled this question on 14 May and we are now in July; if the Council had wanted to answer, it would have provided some information yesterday on the number of human lives lost. I consequently deduce that the Council, rather than being unable to give information, does not wish to answer. This could be interpreted as demonstrating scorn for the fact that the European Parliament represents the people. The victims of an unjust war must not be consigned to oblivion or to disdain by an institution such as the European Parliament.

Within the framework of this policy, we all recognise that human resources are a development factor of prime importance. Our policies must therefore be based on the principle of equality between men and women if we really want to give development opportunities to all rural citizens, men and women alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The policies of the European Union to strengthen the role of women in rural areas have not had the anticipated results. Today, in the European Union, the proportion of women working in agriculture is 37%. This percentage varies from one country to another, but the situation on farm holdings and in social life in rural areas has more or less the same characteristics. Only one in five farms are managed by women and the majority of these are small farms. Over the last decade there has only been an increase in this proportion of 1%. Approximately one in two women involved in agricultural production and life have the status of farmer's wife or partner, a status of invisible, unrecognised work which is not in keeping with the quality of work objectives of the European citizen and which does not provide any preconditions for personal development and the growth of local society.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of education of women is very low, both as regards basic education and as regards the level of full or partial agricultural education. Social security differs from country to country. In some places women farmers have derived [rights], in some places the same rights, and in this report we maintain that this issue should be dealt with seriously at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a shortage of tools to date. Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equality between men and women, which also covers agricultural activity, is not binding enough and we therefore maintain it should be revised and brought into line with the new situation. The Member States, for their part, must also recognise and safeguard the work of women farmers, as regards security and pensions, with contributions at levels compatible with family work.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal by our committee is that, within the framework of the programmes and the funding of the Structural Funds for rural development, especially the Leader Plus programme, particular attention should be paid to strengthening the role of women farmers. At the same time, the Leader Observatory must be strengthened, so that it covers the gaps in European statistics as regards the situation of women in rural areas and completes them by collating additional figures and introducing networks so that we can track the situation as it stands today and measure the progress we hope there will be in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the resolution which I recommend that you approve proposes replacing the current method of calculating subsidies, funding for farm holdings, which takes account of the holdings and not the active persons, with the result that women working as the second member of the couple lose out under a system which takes no account of the total number of people working on the holding and their real contribution. It is proposed to direct the funds obtained from redistributing direct support to programmes in favour of women farmers, while we call on the European Commission to make provision within the framework of the future programme for the Structural Funds for rural development, in the new programme period, for a special programme for women farmers, due to the fact that, so far, the horizontal lines in the Structural Funds have not achieved the expected results.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we call on both the European Commission and the Member States to make life in rural areas easier and more attractive to young women, young women farmers, because we see that the presence of women in rural areas is a declining demographic development. You can find all the proposals and the explanatory statement in our report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> First of all, I wish to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for having taken the initiative with this report, and I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has welcomed this report, with the content of which it largely agrees. This is an own-initiative report and raises a set of issues that will help to place women nearer the centre of the Union’s common agricultural and rural development policies. The report pursues the same approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its conclusions of May 2002 on gender equality in the CAP and in rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That document focuses on the need to consolidate the second pillar of the CAP and the Commission fully shares this opinion. In fact, in our proposals for CAP reform, which were approved in Luxembourg last week, additional funds have already been set aside for rural development as of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Before making a detailed study of some of the points, I should like to recall that Regulation (EEC) No 1257/99 on rural development aid already allows Member States to include specific measures for women in their rural development programmes, such as investment in farm holdings run by women, aid to integrate young women farmers, training, the marketing and processing of farm products, aid for artesanal activity, rural tourism and other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have already funded measures specifically targeting women or have integrated the principle of equal opportunities in their programmes for rural development, for example, including gender as a selection criterion for allocating Union funds. For this reason, some of the measures that the report calls on the Commission to take, such as item 6, for example, should be requested by the Member States that are already in a position to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees fully with some of the requests made in the report. I shall now address these. First of all, in its procedures for approving relevant projects under the Structural Funds, Parliament asks the Commission to ensure that due attention is paid to the need to give women in farming a more relevant role to play. From the beginning, in the 2000-2006 Structural Funds programming period, the Commission recommended that the principle of equal opportunities should be integrated into the Structural Funds and, more recently, the Commission published a Communication that includes recommendations to Member States such as awarding extra points in the selection criteria to projects that contribute to gender equality or to the application of specialist knowledge in this area in the funds’ management.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim evaluation of the Structural Funds, due to take place at the end of this year, will take account of these developments. The Commission also agrees with the European Parliament’s insistence on the importance of the Leader initiative – items 12, 13 and 25 of its report – in promoting the role of women in rural areas. The Member States are already obliged to reveal in their annual reports the number of local action groups in which women are part of the decision-making body, the number of women who benefit from Leader funds and the budget that is allocated to these projects. The interim evaluation of Leader, which will be presented at the end of this year, will also give us a better understanding of how these initiatives are working.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission intends, in line with the proposal you make in item 24, to ensure that one of the tasks of the future European observatory, Leader, is to compile and disseminate best practice on integrating and involving farmers in rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament on the need to create incentives to encourage women’s participation in farm production and to promote a balanced representation of women farmers in the various decision-making bodies. There are, however, some points your report makes with which the Commission cannot agree. The report wants the Commission to attach priority to ensuring that resources obtained through the modulation of direct aid are reallocated to programmes that incorporate measures to benefit the social groups most in need, such as women in rural areas. Nevertheless, as you know, it falls to the Member States to decide on the future reallocation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can the Commission accept the request to create a unit responsible for equal opportunities in the Directorate-General for Agriculture. This Directorate-General has already conducted a highly detailed study of the issue of equality, and consequently we do not see any need to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to look at Parliament’s request for a revision of Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture. The Commission is of the opinion that such a revision is unnecessary, since many aspects of this Directive, especially those concerning employment and working conditions, are already regulated in the recent Directive 2002/73/EC amending Directive 76/207/EEC, and, given that these recent amendments also apply to self-employed workers pursuant to Paragraph 1(3), we do not feel there is any need to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, applying the category of self-employed worker to spouses provides, in principle, adequate coverage for social security schemes, without discriminating on the grounds of gender since the applicable legislation would in this case be Directive 79/7/EEC, on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security, which would enable us to address such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the observations I wish to make on this initiative, and I thank you very much for having undertaken this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Women play a decisive part in the economic development of rural areas. Women’s continuing role, especially on small farms, as invisible workers – to which reference has just been made – is also made apparent by agricultural statistics according to which the proportion of women varies slightly from 0.2% to 0.3%, although nobody can deny that, as there is such a wide range of tasks to be done, women may well do more work on farms than men. This, then, is where we have to focus more on women’s role in the labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, nobody will now expect the Agriculture Directorate-General to turn itself into an equal opportunities office for women – that would surely be to ask too much of it – but the programmes can of course include priorities that also take women into account, and I acknowledge that the Commission is already doing something about this. If we consider the ways in which funds are allocated, it becomes clear that what we call bottom-up approaches – that is to say, those in which local labour is involved – provide specific opportunities for women. On the whole, they are much more actively involved than are the men. If we give our attention to this, we will enhance women’s role as workers and give them greater economic clout, and that will benefit rural areas as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, as a man, conclude my speech by saying so, women will of course – as they must – defend their own interests, and we see in rural areas that they are very well able to do this and that they are already playing their part in shaping agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, at last, there will be improved opportunities for giving support in this area, although, of course, for the farmers whose income is to be cut, this is no substitute and not much of a comfort. This is where women will come into their own, having, as is well known, a greater flexibility and more imaginative approach when it comes to taking on new tasks that can bring in some additional income.</p>
<p class="contents">This does of course depend on the right framework conditions being in place, and also on gender mainstreaming – or, to put it in comprehensible terms, equality of opportunity for men and women. Serious attention needs to be given to this in this context, so that new potential sources of income can be opened up in labour, marketing, tourism and culture – areas in which women are especially efficient, and in relation to which there are many sensible suggestions in the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, whom I thank most warmly for her work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in its opinion, harks back to my 1997 report on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed in agriculture. Six years have passed since this House called upon the Commission to cause an amendment to be made to the 1986 directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture. I regret that the Commission has taken no specific action in response to this report. As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just reminded us, we did, for example, demand the registration of working married couples, so that they would no longer be invisible in the labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might say one last thing, Mr President, if you want to do something to keep women in rural areas, you have to ensure that they suffer no discrimination either as regards fair payment for their work or as regards social security. We want and need mandatory insurance specifically for the millions of assisting spouses, and this is where I might, perhaps, recommend Luxembourg’s approach as exemplary.</p>

You too, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, spoke as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Women make up some 40% of the fifteen million people who work in agriculture in the EU, and run one in every five farms – around 1.3 million – which, apart from a mere 3% larger ones, are small and medium-sized operations. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report gives more detailed information on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, of all the Community’s policies, the CAP is far and away the most highly developed, there is still a positively criminal neglect of gender mainstreaming. The consequence of this is that there is scarcely any visible sign of women in rural areas enjoying equal status and equal rights. Although a number of instruments have been devised, any visible breakthrough in the CAP is still a long way in the future. Even though, in my view, the reform of agricultural policy left the fields strewn with dead lobbyists, it does have a very apparent shortcoming in that women have not managed to get the systematic promotion of women in agriculture accepted. Especially painful though that is, it is primarily in the restructuring of rural areas in the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe that even greater pain will be felt.</p>
<p class="contents">What is on our minds is the new working arrangements that have to be devised. We are thinking about facilities that improve the balance between working life and family life, as well as about childcare facilities, and the provision of care for disabled and older people. We are thinking about the need to further develop rural tourism, and about how to promote alternative energies, and regional marketing cycles. These may be only <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>approaches, but they have added to the range of culture on offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have eventually found a small niche in all this and seized an opportunity, but I think of the state of Bavaria, from which I come and which the President knows well – there, in 2002, EUR 17 million from the rural development programme were not allocated, which – if we add in the co-financed sums that could have been used for specific projects, including for women – means that a total of EUR 34 million could not be paid out. As regards many of the available resources, we still have to exert pressure on the Member States, and so I ask the Commission, when monitoring the programmes’ operation, to pay much closer attention to the way in which gender mainstreaming is actually implemented, so that it does not remain merely a topic for pious utterances.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has endorsed Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report. We have tabled amendments in the hope of extending it to cover the fisheries sector, in which a very large number of women work. I speak also on behalf of the rapporteur when I ask the House to support us in seeking this, and I appeal to the Commission to include this dimension.</p>

Women have far too little power; far too few of them are at the helm of businesses, and in my country, the Netherlands, with 6% of female business managers, they are worse off than anywhere else; we should hang our heads in shame.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, one in two women farmers fall within the spouse or partner category, which is particularly detrimental to their entitlement to social security. That should change; in that respect, I totally agree with what Mrs Lulling said about finally adopting the recommendations of 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, for a moment, to dwell upon the rural policy regulation. Agricultural policy has indeed changed recently, and I do not know whether we should be that pleased with every aspect of this change. When the whole dossier is finally analysed, the rural policy regulation appears to have become the cuckoo in the nest. Mr Olsson too has already indicated in his report on rural policy how important this can be, for example, in order to give the switch-over to other sources of income, such as, agro-tourism, care farms, new energy sources, organic farming, local services and cultural manifestations a shot in the arm. That is where opportunities lie, particularly for women. This has already been said by other speakers and I should like to add something.</p>
<p class="contents">There are vast areas in Europe with large cities. Particularly rural areas near large cities can develop a raft of special services, and so I urge that this rural regulation should include a rural policy criterion in relation to large cities. I really think it is worth giving serious thought to this as a committee, and I have also raised questions in writing on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to warn against certain forms of rural pauperisation. Although buildings, in particular, do, in fact, form part of the cultural heritage, they are in a bad state of repair in many areas. I think that a sound rural policy could save a great deal, and especially for women, there are many opportunities to use these buildings for new services, such as cultural events, receiving tourists, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed when the Commissioner said that he could not give any guarantees for channelling the resources from the CAP leg to the second pillar. I know that the Commission wanted to put aside more resources for this in the first instance and that the Council cut these back. I also know therefore, that we must sound the alarm, particularly in our own country, but nevertheless, I hope that the Commission will continue to insist on a greater shift towards the rural policy regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, however, their contribution is not properly recognised and they do not have the support they need for their quality of life to improve. This report is thus very timely. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on the work she has carried out, and especially on her inclusion of proposals, some of them tabled by me, relating to the need to put particular emphasis on family-based farming, support for small and medium-sized farmers, and recognition of women from these areas in terms of social security. The latter includes women’s right to a respectable retirement pension, though without their having to pay contributions which impose an excessive burden on family farms.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, I fear, offer similar congratulations to the Agriculture Council on its conclusions of 25 and 26 June, in relation to the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), because I believe that these conclusions pave the way for severe problems for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers. Women in rural areas play a prominent role in such farms, especially in less-favoured regions and in countries such as my own.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise the special importance of the statement made in the report under debate here to the effect that the mid-term review of the CAP will only have a positive impact on equal opportunities if its objectives are substantially modified so as to ensure that family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers are given particular prominence. Equally important, however, are the proposals upholding the establishment of a specific programme devoted to the ‘Women’ project, as well as those proposals emphasising the need to pay particular attention to creating public infrastructures, community facilities and quality services, so as to ensure an appropriate network of rural services in all areas, including high-quality family planning, educational and training services and cultural facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by insisting also on the need to close the severe gaps in agricultural statistics. The appropriate measures could then be adopted to improve living conditions for these women and make it easier for young women farmers to establish themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, Commissioner, that the whole debate illustrates the fact that we are facing two major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to see the common agricultural policy as an opportunity to look at rural development in a new light. For this purpose, we will need to employ all the forces in rural areas. We will need to shape those forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these forces are more flexible than others. I know from experience that women are often much more open to innovation than men. I therefore hope that projects will be set up whereby entrepreneurship – which women display in practice but which is often not recognised economically, politically or socially – will be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">This recognition is, of course, necessary. I would like to give the example of farm tourism in Australia, where agriculture stopped being profitable a long time ago. Families there live by farm tourism. What would become of this without the female entrepreneur? This does, of course, require a proper social statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you not find it shameful that after all these years, as Mrs Lulling clearly stressed, there is still not one country, as far as I know, that has a proper statute for the self-employed helper? This is all done in dribs and drabs. It remains a major problem and I think that the Union should take the initiative to guarantee women helpers in rural areas at least a minimum social standard.</p>

In so doing I ask the House to reflect on and acknowledge their already outstanding contribution, in particular the sacrifices and generosity of previous generations of rural women, who silently toiled under the most difficult conditions with little or no recognition other than the satisfaction of ensuring the welfare of their families and instilling in them the culture, ethos and spiritual values of a profession that has no equal. Society owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of CAP reform, and with the greater emphasis on rural development, the role of women in rural society is of increasing importance. Their leadership qualities are crucial in the mobilisation of the human and physical resources of the rural areas of an enlarged European Union. Equal opportunities for rural women are a necessary prerequisite if we are to achieve the full potential of rural development measures. I would like to see, for example, the Early Retirement from Farming Scheme amended to provide for their greater security.</p>
<p class="contents">Not for the first time I express concern about the continuity of the EU family farm structure, of which women are an important component. Uncertainty about the long-term economic sustainability of farming, coupled with the availability of more financially rewarding employment for young people, has led to a worrying increase in the age profile of European farmers, of whom 37% are women. Of the 14.65 million people working on farms in the EU, 5.37 million are women. The figure for Portugal, at 49%, is the highest and for Ireland, my own country, at 11%, the lowest. Ireland's unique family-farm structure is, however, best demonstrated by the fact that 97% of Irish farms are jointly managed, with women playing an equal and important role. If national governments are to achieve the desirable objective of restoring urban rural balance, already seriously out of hand, then the role of women must be adequately recognised and rewarded.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in Ireland there are many examples of women in leadership roles. The Leader Programme is just one area that comes to my mind. Likewise, the Irish Countrywomen's Association <span class="bold"></span> one of the oldest in Europe <span class="bold"></span> has played an historic role in advancing the cause of rural women and in bridging the rural and urban divide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the short deadline, she has taken a very reasonable and consensus-based approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, at the Third World Congress of rural women held in Madrid, the principle of equal opportunities for countrywomen was upheld as a separate requisite of sustainable development for the rural areas of Europe. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report follows that line. She urges the Commission and the Member States, in cooperation with local government, to implement policies to improve the general living conditions of women in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Although she clearly proposes the adaptation of the Leader+ programme to the new circumstances arising from the accession of the candidate countries, the Commission, as Commissioner Solbes said, will not necessarily go further and immediately extend this adaptation process to all Community initiatives, Interreg, Equal, Urban, etc. The accession of the new members of the European Union will overturn the current criteria and methods for maintaining the rural areas' internal balance, owing to the fact that the percentage of the rural population in the European Union will more than double this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have no reliable statistics on the percentage of women in these areas, either in the European Union or in the accession countries, the Spanish Economic and Social Council has put forward its available statistics on the European Union's Member States. To refer to just one statistic: half of all women working in rural areas only have primary school education.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is quite evident that the Council of Agriculture Ministers needs to make a special effort actively to incorporate the gender dimension in rural development issues. As the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, clearly urges, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the old saying 'men for production, women for reproduction' no longer has any meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it opens the door to more profound and structural phenomena, which relate to women in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have so far had successes in relation to isolated aspects, projects such as Equal and many others, which represent bringing women closer, an intention to help women in rural areas. But often society does not accept or support these efforts by the European Union to help women. The Leader projects, for example, are not always led by women. It is frankly difficult to find a woman sitting at the table: the social system rejects it. What worries me in particular, however, are the structural problems. For example, the depopulation of the countryside essentially goes hand in hand with the abandonment of women, because women have no place in the rural environment, their requirements are not socially recognised, they can neither exercise their rights nor develop themselves as individuals. Studies have been done, in the University of Cantabria for example, which demonstrate that practically 99% of women with university qualifications do not wish to return to the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">We must incentivise transversal policies for helping women. For example, with regard to accessibility of services, we must support the policy of subsidised transport, because women in the countryside often live far from any opportunity, far from medical service, and their children are far away from education since school transport has been removed. Amongst the transversal support policies we should promote access to IT systems and bring the wealth of the urban system closer to the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I believe we should study the harm that will be done through the delocalised policy, because clearly, not only are women going to end up without work, as in the case of the milk crisis, for example, and many other agriculture crises, but also their moveable and immoveable assets – particularly the former – will no longer be in the market. Furthermore, reforestation is all very well, but we should bear in mind that these people go to the city without any assets, which have been the inheritance upon which they have supported the development of their enterprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have therefore changed my initial position and I am voting in favour of this final text.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Council of Ministers of 26 June 2003, however, have been insufficient in this regard. I understand the efforts made today by Commissioner Solbes to present it in a positive manner. I understand it because Mr Solbes, when he was Minister for Agriculture in Spain, was sensitive towards women in the field of rural development. What has been agreed on the reform of the CAP, however, in no way takes women into consideration. What is more, neither Commissioner Fischler in his proposals, nor what the Ministers have approved, makes the slightest mention of women. I have studied all the agreements and only indirectly, by means of rural development or the mention of young farmers, can I see any improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind, therefore, the importance of these agreements on the reform of the CAP, this is very serious and we must ensure that the regulations included in this reform take account of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The most interesting points in the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, as it now stands, are the recognition and improvements for assisting spouses, men and women, the effective promotion measures, microloans, soft loans, and the proposal, which is very necessary, that women should participate in decision-making in professional and sectoral agricultural organisations. It is necessary because the CAP is still sexist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it does not highlight the causes or who is responsible for this situation. A conscientious effort is being made to disorientate by creating the impression in women farmers that their position can be improved within the framework of the even harsher anti-farming measures being promoted with the recent reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings about the efficiency of programmes such as Leader I and II are also misleading. It is a known fact that these programmes refer to complementary actions as far as farming and rural development are concerned and the level of funding under the so-called second pillar is not only trivial, but also mainly profits those who exercise a business activity in the subsidised sectors of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report essentially accepts the supplementary and unequal role of women farmers in agricultural activity, as well as the effort to remove women in rural areas from agricultural employment, which is why they are being guided to similar activities. These proposals serve the European Union's objective to further shrink the agricultural population and desert rural areas, which already have huge abandonment problems, especially in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this being so, proposals such as creating crèches, cultural centres, public transport and so on range from the insignificant to the cynically hypocritical. Women farmers' acute problems are the result of the CAP and anti-farming policies. Consequently, only overturning them can safeguard the continuity of farming activity, a stable income and a dignified standard of living for women farmers.</p>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, understanding and valuing the particular contribution which women farmers can make to improving rural areas, organised a public dialogue on the subject on 18 March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the recent reform of the CAP, we expect, Commissioner, the additional funds which will be made available for rural development to target and improve the life of women farmers, which is downgraded and undervalued in all the regions of the European Union. We particularly hope that the necessary infrastructures will be created which will allow women farmers to combine their working and family life and have quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we recognise that the third Community Support Framework helped enormously to create an institutional and funding action framework for rural development, which included women. In Greece, thousands of women are benefiting from the Community initiative, Leader. Nonetheless, legal and advisory support is needed for women in rural areas, with information and awareness-raising actions within local communities, training programmes, actions which will support the specific needs of women and local development objectives, in the aim of supporting and safeguarding employment and ensuring women farmers stay in their area.</p>

Passengers in these vehicles will be informed of the obligation to use safety belts when the vehicle is moving.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will adopt the legal, regulatory and administrative provisions necessary to ensure compliance with the directive by 9 May 2006. In order to extend the obligatory installation of belts to all vehicles, including coaches, the Commission has also recently proposed a modification of three directives in force relating to safety belts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the issue of road infrastructure, the Commission intends to propose a directive on the guidelines to be adopted by the Member States in order to establish national systems for the identification and management of blackspots, safety audits and minimum rules on information for drivers for application within the trans-European road network. The point relating to rail crossings, which is one of those raised by Mr Caveri, will be included in the procedures for the management of blackspots and safety audits proposed in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission has recently adopted a new action programme on road safety which includes a specific chapter on the safe transport of goods and passengers. Apart from the directive approved recently on the training of professional drivers of goods and passengers by road, a legislative proposal is also being prepared, specifically a directive aimed at improving the application of the social provisions on driving and rest periods, as well as working hours. This directive will lead to a considerable increase in the number of controls for verifying compliance with driving and rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the action programme does not include any specific measure on the construction of coaches, the Commission will carefully study the recommendations of ECBOS research project, which is producing a final report. This project will make proposals aimed at improving the rules in force and will propose new regulations and standards for the construction of safer buses and coaches, in order, for example, to achieve better protection in the event of accidents involving overturning. Furthermore, the Commission plans, in the near future, to propose an obligatory system for the approval of vehicles, for coaches and lorries, similar to the one in force for private cars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, they have shed light on the position as regards the law, organisational issues, and the technical state of the art. To sum all this up, there is a strong common interest in not damaging the buses’ image as a basically very safe means of transport, with buses and coaches accounting for only 0.2 deaths per thousand million passenger-kilometres, compared with 6.8 for private cars and 0.6 for railways. I would not want to let this opportunity go by without expressing my gratitude and appreciation to the many reputable bus companies and their drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that the consensual view is that what is lacking is primarily attributable to the human factor on the one hand and to the way laws are implemented on the other. Does the Commission think it possible that the situation may be improved, above all by influencing how people behave in road traffic and within enterprises, but also by the exchange of information? Secondly, is it not the case that greater use should be made of the opportunities for monitoring vehicles and their drivers, in order to be able to identify those we call the black sheep and make them take responsibility for their actions? I take the view that, thirdly, checks should be carried out to see whether the standards for testing currently in force are sufficient to ensure that the main examinations and safety tests on buses are carried out to a qualitatively high standard. As the use of electronic components to ensure the stability and safety of vehicles increases, all the more necessary, I believe, does the regular inspection of this electronic equipment become. Fourthly, I expect the Commission to give priority to the safety of buses and coaches when it submits its proposal on the Third Action Programme on Road Safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation amounts to a war on Europe’s roads, and it cannot be allowed to continue like this. Over recent months, a series of accidents involving buses has occurred, in which people have died or been severely injured. I believe this to be an issue with which we should concern ourselves more and more. Buses and coaches – for which I, as a Green, have a particular fondness – are among the most environmentally friendly ways of travelling, but they must become even safer than they have been to date. Another reason why we have to give attention to this issue is the fact that we will see much more traffic on the roads in the coming years as a result of the eastward and southward enlargement of Europe. As shown by the people in the visitors’ galleries, bus and coach travel is on the increase, as people make more journeys with them, and so we have to do more to make it safer.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may say something about human error, we know that social dumping on the roads presents us with a major problem. Working times are not adhered to, which is another way of saying that legislation in this area is not stringent enough. Nor are there enough controls. I can do no other than appeal to the Italian Presidency of the Council to at last take the Markov report on working hours seriously and give it priority, rather than doing as the Greek Presidency did and putting it on ice for months on end. Only if we improve working hours will we have better-rested coach drivers on the roads and be able to do something about exhaustion. This will of course involve more controls, and I am glad that the Commission wants to do something about these.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of safety that we have to get to grips with is the requirement to fit seatbelts, which at present applies only to new coaches. We cannot wait ten or 15 years for coaches to be replaced by new ones. We have to take action now and make use of all the technical possibilities offered by present-day coaches. Accidents over recent months have shown that many people have died because they were catapulted out of coaches that had been overturned. Safety belts will enable us to tackle this, and I hope that both the Commission and the Council of Governments will summon up the energy to do something about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an incident which shook all of us in Greece, it was widely reported in Europe and, together with the other tragic accidents, has brought us to today's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, the European Commission's ten-year programme, which we shall also be looking at and commenting on extensively within the framework of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, and there are other ideas which are already referred to in our motion. It has rightly been stressed that we must look immediately at the question of safety belts. It has also rightly been stressed that we must look at the question of coach specifications and I welcome the European Commission's position on this point. However, we must, of course, also look at the question of driving times, because often drivers cannot do their job properly because they are exhausted. The European Parliament has made a proposal here, which I hope the Council will deal with positively.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, want to comment on two individual issues. The first is the issue of speed limiters. I highlight this because I myself was rapporteur to the European Parliament. The legislation exists. And it is up to the governments to apply this specific legislation as quickly as possible. It has been proven that by limiting speed, especially in the case of large vehicles, we also limit the possibility of accidents and their consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say, and this concerns the European Commission, has to do with the projects funded under the Community Support Framework. We will need to pay particular attention to road projects in order to avoid poor workmanship. I have the particularly sad experience of my own country, where new projects have very serious levels of poor workmanship, which is why they are dangerous and cannot always be used safely. Consequently, the quality of works needs to be strictly controlled by the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The appropriate fines were imposed to the tune of nearly EUR 17 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about an agreement made in France between four federations of farmers and two federations of abattoirs at the end of 2001. The agreement consisted of a minimum price commitment and a suspension-restriction of imports from other Member States. Initially it took the form of a public written agreement and then, once the Commission had sent letters of warning, of a secret oral agreement. These agreements were made within the context of low prices in the beef market as a result of the crisis in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of data communicated by the Directorate-General for Agriculture, the Directorate-General for Competition opened up an investigation and sent demands for information in the middle of November 2001. On this basis, the Commission – and I would like to stress this – initially did no more than send letters of warning at the end of November 2001. All the parties to the agreement then assured the Commission, in writing, that they were putting an end to the illegal agreement. But the Commission found evidence that the parties were maintaining the agreement secretly. The unannounced inspections carried out in the middle of December 2001 confirmed the Commission’s suspicions. The parties were given the opportunity to present written and oral comments. The decision adopted on 2 April 2003 concludes, on the basis of a repeated ruling of the Court of Justice, that, firstly, there is a price agreement which violates the provisions of Article 81 of the Treaty and that, secondly, there is an agreement to suspend imports from other Member States, which also violates Community competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The documentation discovered by the Commission during the course of the investigation demonstrates that, furthermore, all the organisations in question knew that the agreement they were making was illegal and that they were liable for intervention by the competition authorities. The Commission imposed fines of EUR 12 million on the FNSA, the main French agricultural federation, and of up to EUR 480 000 on one of the federations of abattoirs.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to remind you that, in the event of very serious violations of competition rules, the Commission imposes fines of the basic sum for each participant, in principle, of a minimum of EUR 20 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The three main criticisms levelled at the Commission's decision are: firstly, that this is an attack on trade union freedoms; secondly, that the fine is excessive, given the context of crisis; and thirdly, the Commission's lack of action over the second mad cow disease crisis. I will try to respond to these three arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to trade union freedom, the Commission believes that the scope of the decision has been exaggerated. Trade union freedom is a fundamental freedom, recognised by everybody. The Commission reiterates this in its decision. But this freedom does not give the right to do absolutely anything: a trade union cannot legitimately make an agreement on prices and import restrictions violating the principles of the common market. The decision says no more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the size of the fine, it must be borne in mind that it is set in accordance with the seriousness of the violation and with the aggravating circumstances. Well, in this case the violation was serious but so were the aggravating circumstances. In this respect, we should remember that the farmers obliged the abattoirs to sign the illegal agreement through acts of violence. We must also remember that the parties, having provided assurances that the agreement would not be renewed, in actual fact continued to apply it in secret. Furthermore, the Commission did take into account the difficult economic context the agricultural sector was working within, the dual crisis of mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease, which Mr Bernié referred to in his speech in this House on 7 April, and, it was precisely as a result of this very unusual context that for the first time the fine has been reduced by 60%, a not inconsiderable percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">The third criticism is that it was the Commission itself that did not adopt adequate measures to deal with the mad cow disease crisis. In this regard, we should remember that the Commission multiplied its measures for market stabilisation. The intervention mechanisms were used extensively, and the application conditions were increased, specific crisis mechanisms were created to allow the Member States to withdraw from the market additional quantities of channels. In this way, in a few months, almost 10% of European consumption was withdrawn from the market. More than EUR 1 billion of the Community budget was used for this operation and, furthermore, the Commission authorised the Member States to grant national aid to the worst affected farmers. In the case of France, the Commission approved more than EUR 300 million in state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should remember that, although the crisis in the beef sector affected the whole of Europe, the Commission is not aware of any parties in any other Member State deeming it necessary to create an illegal cartel. The decision, which explains the facts as established by the Commission and its illegal conclusions in detail, will be published shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although you do discuss this, the fact remains that livestock farmers were in an extraordinarily difficult situation. The BSE crisis dealt the market a blow the like of which it had never before experienced, and this is something else for which the Commission has to assume its responsibility. Let me remind you that this crisis was marked by repeated attempts by the Commission and, to a varying degree, the Council and some of the Member States, to pour oil on troubled waters, which had a negative effect on the market when disaster actually struck. Let me remind you that it was this House and its investigating committee that had to force the Commission – and to some extent also the Council – to act in order that steps could be taken, not only to make provision for health care and to combat the disease, but also to compensate the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that, in such a situation, people will look for ways of defending themselves, even those that are not legal. I do not want to defend this, and they must be punished for it, but then we – by which I mean the Commission – must accept our own responsibilities. Moreover, we must, in addition to the current measures for cleaning up and regulating the market, which you have described, take a good hard look at the agricultural policy. At that time, the situation was that the 90-head upper limit for bull premiums, which had applied in France, did not apply in other countries – Germany being one of them – so that we were paid premiums for every bull that we could produce, while a limit was in force in France. This meant that, in France, a stable market developed, and other countries tried very hard to get their exports onto it. France and the livestock price therefore came under pressure. This, then, is another area in which the agricultural policy must ensure that conditions are the same, in order that we do not end up with the same premium being paid for the twenty-thousandth bull as was paid for the twentieth. The alternative is that this measure must apply in all countries. Let me again remind you that this disparity within the agricultural sector gave rise to major problems, in that it stoked up competition within the agricultural sector. If then, the Commission wants to avail itself of such penalties, it must always take the conditions into account and keep at least the amount of the penalty in line with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It punishes the unions twice: firstly you punish a sector for its ability to demonstrate initiative, which enabled it to provide assistance for coping with a quite exceptional crisis. You then threaten the very existence of the unions, because the size of the fine is greater than their budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The French beef industry employs 200 000 farmers, whose average income is less than EUR 8 000 per year. In the autumn of 2001, prices fell by more than 45% whereas the price of beef for consumption continued, paradoxically, to rise. Furthermore, there was no sign of any European solidarity and the French market was saturated by consignments of meat at giveaway prices arriving from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context of exceptional crisis, there was no longer even a market. French farming unions decided, with the agreement of the French Minister for Agriculture and of his Ministry, to set a minimum price. This price was so low that it allowed for no profit margin at all. There is no way that it was a secret agreement because, on the very evening on which the agreement was signed, the French unions held a press conference. Despite what one reads in the press, therefore, this was not the setting-up of a cartel; it was instead an act of solidarity to prevent the disappearance of one aspect of farm production: high-quality beef.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe had not failed in its task of ensuring market stability, French farmers would not have needed to take over from it. In an exceptional crisis, exceptional measures are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, I should like to ask you a few questions. Can you specify what measures the Commission took and can you tell me why these measures failed? Did you really understand the depth of farmers’ concern and the risk that a high-quality sector might disappear? Can you tell me on what basis you set the fine at EUR 16.7 million, a figure that I believe is astronomical? Do you not think that the Commission’s position runs counter to the principle of setting a minimum price? Lastly, do you not think that in a context in which the farming unions have asked the European Court of Justice to arbitrate, the Commission should try to calm the situation, given the circumstances, by withdrawing these penalties? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must remember the tragic situation facing the European Union in the autumn of 2001, when the appalling mad cow crisis emerged: exaggerated fears on the part of consumers led to a staggering fall in beef consumption and prices collapsed to unprecedented levels. Institutional caterers, hypermarkets and slaughterhouses refused to accept beef. Desperate farmers saw their livestock pile up and their feed stock disappear and threatened public order. And what proposals did the European Commission come up with? Feeble and ineffectual measures, which came nowhere near to addressing the scale of the crisis and the troubles that it was causing. It proposed optional measures for slaughter and destruction, which some Member States did not implement, in particular Germany and the Netherlands, which exported their problems to France and refused to come to the aid of their own farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the measures adopted in France by common agreement between the public authorities and the farming profession, which consisted of setting, in conjunction with slaughterers, a buying scale at prices that also matched the ‘purchase for destruction’ prices set by the Commission and of appealing to importers to stop importing beef were perfectly appropriate to the situation and had an immediate calming effect. The Commission’s accusation of an illegal agreement appears, therefore, to be completely out of touch and scandalous, given the seriousness of the situation at the time and, to be quite honest, both absurd and irresponsible. I therefore urge the Commission to call off this action, which makes no sense and to dedicate all its energies to uncovering the real secret agreements which are the real threats to free competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only this morning, a Dutch aid worker over there told me that he would not know which party he would vote for in the general elections at the end of this month. His message is clear and fair: Europe must treat all Cambodian parties with the same amount of criticism as we follow their progress to the ballot boxes. In that sense, I am also waiting for the report of the EU election observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, Cambodia is undergoing a transition – from being a country primarily dependent on humanitarian aid to being a regular developing country. There is still a need for assistance from the European Union. I have heard very critical comments from the field about the coordination and effectiveness of this European helping hand. The way to build a better future for the people of Cambodia is through decentralisation and the frequent involvement of co-financing organisations. In short, the Echo investments, while useful, require a logical sequel in the form of the actual implementation of the EC strategy document for Cambodia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some two million people lost their lives, while an incalculable number were displaced and deported. Even the wearing of spectacles put your life at risk, and higher education meant that you were doomed.</p>
<p class="contents">If, today, you travel through this beautiful tropical country, with its impressive stone buildings that testify to the antiquity of its culture, then, wherever you go, you still come face to face with the physical and mental damage done to a tormented people, who, first, were terrorised by the Khmer Rouge, and then put under the yoke by their Vietnamese liberators, finally achieving a small measure of normality under the UN mandate. The reason why I have been able to follow this process is that I have visited the country a number of times and was one of the many who observed the elections in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that nowhere else in the world are there so many households headed by a woman in comparison to those headed by a man. Even more than the women, it was their sons, husbands and brothers who fell victim to a system that held human life in contempt and in violent conflicts, including American bombs and Vietnamese landmines, which, time and time again, blew people to their deaths or left them gravely wounded – something that they continue to do. What is left is poverty, need, a people torn up by their roots, and – it has to be said – a certain willingness to resort to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter is now, of course, being manifested in the run-up to the elections, but I do believe that it has to be made clear – as has been unambiguously stated by, among others, the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia – that the situation is proving to be less hazardous than it once was, and the organisation ‘Asian Network for Free Elections’ notes a marked decrease in violence in comparison to previous elections. As regards these elections, it will be very important that we keep an eye on how things develop before they are held, for it is clear that they will not pass without any friction whatever. Nor, I believe, can we expect them to do so in view of the history on which this country can look back. If, though, we can help to strengthen the forces of democracy in it, and deeply impress upon the population the significance of democratic elections, we will have taken an important step towards creating, in this region, something of an enclave journeying towards democracy, for we have to concede that conditions in neighbouring countries are no better – indeed, they tend to be even worse. I therefore hope that Cambodia will find its way to democracy, a way to be humane and a way to renounce violence, and will be able to lead its neighbours by example.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, one of the big concerns is that since January apparently at least 15 people, mostly opposition supporters, have been killed in violence related to the forthcoming election in July. When we in the ASEAN delegation were in Cambodia not so long ago, we met with some of the opposition parties and some of them were going to funerals of their members who had been killed. This situation is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation and standards have not improved in Cambodia in the last 10 years and human rights organisations have routinely pointed out that their big concern remains impunity for the perpetrators of human rights violations, notably members of the police and the military. The only successful prosecution in Cambodia dates back to 1993, when under the UN administration someone was charged and sentenced; that was a Mr Ten Seng, who is still working as deputy chief in the prison where he committed his crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also grave concern for the Vietnamese Montagnard refugees, who are still being returned to Vietnam to face ill treatment and unfair trials. This was brought up before in this Parliament. The legal safeguards exist but they are not being respected in Cambodia. There is a provision to outlaw the use of torture and to provide mechanisms and safeguards within the judicial and penal system against different forms of ill treatment and to ensure sanctions towards the perpetrators. That problem however, is still not being solved because there is a disregard for the existing safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would hope that a new or future government and parliament would ensure respect for these laws and ensure that this kind of situation cannot continue. There must be total freedom there. It is also very important that the new future government or parliament will ensure the former leaders of the Khmer Rouge are put on trial. It is quite incredible to think that these people are still getting off scot-free for mass abuses of human rights.</p>

That is in itself an indication of some degree of progress towards democracy. At the end of the day, of course, what counts is the way in which these elections are conducted, as well as what happens before and after them, and whether the process is fair and deserves to be described as democratic. It is this that we have good reasons to doubt. Violence continues to overshadow the preparations for the election; opposition politicians are intimidated, two of them having been murdered in June alone. Everything demonstrates the total power wielded by the autocratic Communist Party, which evidently cannot reconcile itself to the idea that other parties have to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules on local elections are infringed, as a rule by the local authorities, and such breaches go unpunished. The quality of a democracy depends on freedom of access to the media, above all to the electronic media, something that is not guaranteed, not least because the latter continue to be under the control of the Cambodian People’s Party and the Prime Minister, Hun Sen, or of organisations and persons associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is sending observers to monitor the Cambodian elections. To do so makes no sense unless they are able to do their work unhindered, and the country’s government must ensure that they are able to do so. By demanding all these things, we are not in some way illicitly interfering in the country’s internal affairs, but are acting on the basis of a cooperation agreement, Article 1 of which states in clear terms that respect for the principles of democracy and for basic human rights are among the elements of this agreement and that they must be adhered to by both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1992, the European Union has been deeply involved in Cambodia. Having invested some EUR 250 million in the country, we can legitimately make certain demands as regards the fairness of elections. We therefore demand that the Cambodian Government should put an end to the violence and prevent the intimidation of opposition politicians and their parties. Our further demand of the Cambodian authorities is that they should ensure that these elections can be held freely and without interference.</p>

The Cambodian people deserve a peaceful future. This is why it is of great importance that the forthcoming elections should proceed in a fair and peaceful manner. Moreover, the mass slaughterers should not escape their sentences. My group has concerns on both counts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are receiving many reports on atrocities being committed in connection with the elections. The Cambodian People's Party is omnipresent and the authorities go out of their way to intimidate the people, particularly at local level. It seems that they can do this undisturbed and unpunished. The electronic media are also in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen's party. My group is particularly anxious that Sam Rainsy's party will not be given a fair chance as a result. Given his great courage and his merits in respect of a democratic Cambodia, Sam Rainsy deserves the Sakharov prize.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation is still bad. It is also regrettable indeed that, despite considerable amounts of European aid, economic and social development is stagnating. We are in favour of linking this aid to progress in the field of pluralism, human rights and free elections. After all, democratisation and prosperity cannot be seen in isolation from one another. We have to put the past behind us by doing now what is necessary to ensure a rich future for the poor Cambodian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my fellow Members because I believe that this is a good resolution. Having said that, it always comes back to the question of whether the glass is half full or half empty: as it happens, Mr Nassauer sees the glass as half empty and Mrs Junker sees it as half full. Whatever the truth, I believe that the most important thing now is the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The national electoral commission has set good standards and is doing a remarkable job. We too have come a long way. In January and February the situation was extremely worrying. Violence is still taking place today. If, however, we compare the situation today with what happened at the last elections, things are better. It is true that access to the media is not perfect, but it is better. This is where our resolution is so important: we must remain extremely vigilant so that between now and 27 July, the situation remains positive and elections that are as democratic as possible are able to take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the coming national elections will be a key moment in the development and consolidation of the democratic system in this country. The Union is firmly committed to supporting this process, which will be backed up by the presence of international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that in this regard we share Parliament’s concern that the existence of acts of political violence and the creation of a climate of interference and impunity at the moment is creating tensions in relation to this electoral process. Violence prior to elections is an issue which has been pointed out and highlighted by the Union during the elections of 1998 and 2002 and, although the majority of observers agree that the level of violence seems to be diminishing, there is still concern about its impact on the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sincerely hopes that the measures adopted by the authorities to ensure that the law is complied with, without intimidation, harassment or violence, will have a positive effect and I can assure you that, in this regard, the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, is continuing to monitor the process closely, in order to try to ensure that these situations do not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also concerned about the need for press freedom in order to overcome the difficulties resulting from a public media which is firmly controlled by the government. In this regard, the Commission is insisting on the effective application of the positive measures adopted by the Cambodian authorities, and in particular by the national electoral committee, with regard to the media during the period prior to the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this issue will be of particular interest and concern to the European Union's mission of electoral observers, which began on 11 June, with the arrival of the basic team, headed by Mr Evans: 36 European observers have already arrived in Cambodia and 70 additional observers should arrive on 22 July. The head of the mission of electoral observers will make a preliminary statement immediately after the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our capacity for action in Cambodia, I must point out that the National Indicative Programme 2002-2004 allows us, by means of contributing resources, to try to have an influence on the processes of democratisation in the country. In this regard, the whole concept of governance has been treated as a fundamental horizontal and transversal issue, in all areas of cooperation. So far, we have allocated EUR 10 million to this field, which have allowed us, in particular, to support the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these elements reflect the commitment of the Community and the Commission in the field of human rights and democracy, as demonstrated by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, which has treated Cambodia as one of the fundamental target countries for this experiment. The NGOs, selected by means of invitations to tender, are acting as one of the main channels for the implementation of actions, within the context of this initiative, which are directly benefiting the Cambodian population.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the elements on which we are working, and this is the way we believe progress can be made on this process of consolidation and on achieving the fairest possible elections which will allow us to take a step forward in pursuit of this objective which we all share.</p>

In the northern mountainous region, many of the 300 000 ‘forgotten people of Laos’ are still bearing the brunt of the Communist regime’s vengeance. Their political choice during the Vietnam War was considered ‘treason’ and is still an anathema justifying the present reign of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">The show trial and the absurd sentencing in Phonsavan of a French and a Belgian journalist and an American Hmong pastor is no isolated incident. Cut off from the outside world, Vientiane is trying to break this people. It appears that interest in, and recognition of, the conflict with the Hmong is unwelcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, Laos features on the obscure list of countries that commit serious breaches in respect of freedom of religion. The Christian minority, in particular, is harshly persecuted, and their religion is even prohibited. This violation of individual freedom and personal dignity cannot be justified in the name of any culture or country.</p>
<p class="contents">With the present resolution, I would therefore call on the Laotian authorities to end their repression against Hmong and other, particularly Christian, minorities with immediate effect. Failure to respond to this request should prompt the Council and the Commission to reconsider every aspect of relations with Laos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, these rights have been flouted and today we are forced to condemn the situation in Laos. Since 5 June, two journalists, one French and the other Belgian, have been imprisoned, together with their guides, in Vientiane in Laos. They were arrested in the Xieng Khuang province whilst reporting on the situation of the Hmong minority. After a trial that bordered on the farcical, on 30 June, Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were sentenced to 15 years in prison for ‘obstructing an official in the performance of his duties’, as the case against them described it. This fallacious charge on the one hand and the sentence handed down, on the other, contravene the provisions of the Laotian criminal code.</p>
<p class="contents">Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were in fact convicted simply for carrying out their work as journalists and cameramen, filming a group of mountain people who have been hounded for years by an authoritarian regime that flouts every principle of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution that we propose Parliament should adopt and which we urge its President to convey to the Laotian authorities and to all member countries of ASEAN calls first for the immediate release of the two journalists and their guides; secondly, for international conventions to be applied, including the convention adopted by French-speaking countries in the Bamako declaration, which Laos has ratified, in order to protect the rights of journalists, particularly those reporting in conflict zones. Thirdly, the resolution calls for the immediate suspension of all policies of persecution and repression towards the Hmong people and other minorities in Laos; and fourthly, for all economic cooperation between the EU and Laos to be reviewed, as soon as possible and with the European Parliament being kept informed, as provided for in the agreements to which our resolution refers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, and I wish to state, on behalf of my entire group, that we cannot continue to assist and maintain relations with countries which, in full view of the whole world, breach human rights. It is one of our responsibilities as the European Parliament to condemn things that are totally unacceptable and to say so relentlessly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If one looks at what has happened since, there have been restrictions on access to people in prison, their place of detention has been kept secret for more than a week now. Clearly the trials did not respect their rights under international law. They did not get a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Laos is quite alarming. Not only are these people suffering, but so is the rest of the country. People's rights are not being respected: their civil, political and religious rights are not being respected. There are no rights, for example, for people in prison. Many of these people are unjustifiably in prison. They do not have visitation rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we met with a delegation from Laos. The evidence that they gave us raised serious concerns. Some speakers have said that we need to reconsider our relationship with Laos if the authorities do not take notice of the situation in their own country. It is clear that there should be an immediate release of these journalists. There should be freedom of the press. They need to end the persecution of the Hmong and other minorities. It must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The court case was also criticised by Washington. They called it a farce. They called for a fair trial. We need to be very careful here in respect of who is pointing the finger at whom, considering that Washington is responsible for the Guantanamo Bay issue. Those people have not had a fair trial, nor have they had legitimate charges posed against them. I doubt that this would happen in the European Union. The Americans need to look at what they are doing before they point a finger at anyone else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Laos is an ancient kingdom and very rich in culture; it was, as a country, peaceful and tolerant, which, in the days when it was a kingdom, was a threat to nobody. I am glad that the Laotian royal family are present with us today.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the twentieth century, the country became a victim – firstly of colonialism, then of the Second World War and, last but not least, of the conflict between East and West. It was brutally wrecked by Communist occupation. It must be clear to us that, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, our task is to ensure that Laos becomes a flourishing democratic country rather than ending up as a museum of real-life socialism. We therefore declare that human rights and the rule of law need to be reinforced, that freedom of faith and conscience need to be respected, and that political prisoners must be set free. As a matter of priority, Laos must become freely accessible to the media, so that the world can learn what is actually going on there, and so that the country’s continuing deficiencies are not hidden from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union seek cooperation with Laos. We will abide by the trade and cooperation agreement if the human rights to which it refers are respected, but if this human rights clause is disregarded and treated as nothing but a joke, then we will have to put a question mark against our cooperation – with the regime rather than with the Laotian people – and make it perfectly clear that, while trade, business and cooperation are necessary, they are founded upon law, underpinned by human rights and by the values on which our global community depends. It is for that reason that we make it our concern that Laos should once more be free, democratic and under the rule of law.</p>

I have here the <span class="italic">communiqué</span>, dated 1.30.p.m: ‘the Laotian Minister for Foreign Affaires awaits a request from the governments of the countries from which the three men come: Belgium, France and the United States, for their pardon’ – which will of course be granted if this has not already been done. We can only welcome the effective role played by our Ministers for Foreign Affairs and by the diplomats in the area, a role which, without a shadow of a doubt, has led to the prisoners’ imminent release.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we rejoice in the outcome of these actions, we remain extremely concerned at the fate of the four Laotians who were accompanying Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud and who, we are told, could face a sentence of twenty years in prison. We also appeal to the clemency of the Laotian Government. Too many journalists have paid with their lives or have been given stiff prison sentences for having done their job, which is to inform people.</p>
<p class="contents">We recall that freedom of expression is a fundamental right. We expect the Commission and the Council to support the actions of our diplomats and we hope that our European office in the region will intervene to ensure that the four Laotian citizens are also released. We wish to state, Mr President, before this House, all our solidarity with the journalists and with their families, who have been through such a hard time and assure them that the European Parliament, the guardian of freedom, will relentlessly defend the right to a free press, the right to free information and, more than ever, human rights, whatever regime is in power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their names and locations have not been published. At the same time, we know that, on Monday 30 June of this year, they were sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, without their right to a defence being respected, for having, it was said, impeded an officer in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p class="contents">When we, here in the European Parliament, draw attention to the lack of democratic rights in Laos, we urge the authorities in that country to ensure compliance with the country’s constitution that purports to guarantee religious freedom and freedom for religious groups. We call upon the authorities in Laos immediately to put a stop to all policies involving the persecution and oppression of the Hmong people, other minorities in Laos and Christian population groups. We also call upon the authorities in Laos to give the Red Cross permission to visit the political prisoners in order to assure themselves of their physical well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the Commission should investigate whether it is appropriate to continue with the ongoing cooperation with the authorities in Laos and that it should report to Parliament on this issue. We request of the European Parliament that, if the imprisoned journalists have not been freed before then, the problem be added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to protest against the fact that the Laotian constitution has, in practice, wordings that impede religious freedom in the country by banning all acts that give rise to religious division or lead to a general division among the people. Under these laws, 60 Christians were arrested in 2002, and an active campaign to close churches was conducted between 1999 and 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To give you some indication, Italy comes 40th, after Benin and South Korea. In Laos, the media remains entirely in the hands of the only political party and its parliament is taking its time over adopting a law that will allow private media ownership, which was promised in 2001. There is still no news of the five leaders of the October 1999 movement who have disappeared, including Thongpaseuth Kenakoun, the author of several articles and pamphlets on the situation in Laos and the need for democratic reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud is not, therefore, a judicial accident. It has arisen in a climate of ongoing breaches of human rights and the scandalous verdict that sentenced them to fifteen years in prison on 1 July raises at least two questions. The first is that of the freedom of the press in general, which as we have seen is often flouted, even in Europe. This freedom is one of the pillars of democracy and we must defend it at all costs. The second issue concerns the democratic clause of the cooperation agreements, which could often be described as a clause in form only: a hollow shell.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we expect Europe to be taken seriously, however, when, having signed an agreement, it does not ensure that this clause is respected, by means of appropriate sanctions? We know, as Mrs André-Léonard has confirmed, that the joint pressure exerted by Belgium, France, the United States and the European Union will probably lead to the release of Falise, Reynaud and Naw Karl Mua, which will be a relief for everyone. I call on Parliament, however, also to call for the release of Thao Moua, Tha Char Yang, the two guides, Pa Phue Khang, their driver, and a fourth, unknown Laotian, because they are neither reporters nor foreigners. They are simply Laotians. The sentences they received range from 12 to 20 years in prison and we cannot, Mr President, wash our hands of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to acknowledge their struggle, because it is as a result of that struggle that we in this Parliament are able to work; as a result of their tireless fight for democracy, for the rule of law, for freedom and also for national reconciliation in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that everything has been said in this debate and Mrs de Keyser was right to insist on this point: Mrs André-Léonard’s news about the likely release of the Belgian, French and American journalists does not mean that the four Laotians who were accompanying them will be released; they will end up spending 10, 15 or 20 years in the gaols of Vientiane.</p>
<p class="contents">This business involving the journalists is the umpteenth such occurrence, the umpteenth proof that the situation in Laos is extremely serious, that this regime is totally corrupt, that this regime should be investigated by Interpol and all the international financial bodies, due to the scale of its trafficking, and that the European Union should change its policy vis-à-vis Laos. Every complacent policy simply strengthens the extremist elements in the Laotian regime. We must, by adopting a firm policy, do what we can to encourage those within the regime who wish to work towards a policy of democratisation, towards a policy of reconciliation. This is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We have instruments in place; we give Laos EUR 160 million per year under trade agreements in the textile sector alone. We have dozens of cooperation projects running. We must undertake a very thorough assessment and tell the Laotian regime that, unless they undertake specific and practical reforms in the fields of justice, information, economics and politics, we will end all forms of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the issue of the European journalists arrested, Mr Falise and Mr Reynaud, this issue is being dealt with at bilateral level by France and Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's ministerial troika, however, has had the opportunity to talk bilaterally through the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Laos, on the occasion of the recent Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in Phnom Penh on 19 June. The Commission is in close contact with the French Embassy and with the Belgian Consulate in Vientiane, and with other Member States with local representation or accredited in Bangkok, and the Commission has held an informal meeting with top officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Laos.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission supports the diplomatic actions taken by the Member States in question to find a satisfactory solution to this case, a solution which – we agree with Mrs André-Léonard – can only be found by means of a diplomatic and political solution. Furthermore, we are prepared to take any necessary action to put pressure on the government of Laos at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not, however, consider it useful to include an issue of this type on an agenda of a different nature, such as the meetings of ASEAN, since we do not believe it to be appropriate to raise this issue in high-level multilateral meetings. We hope that the news given earlier by Mrs André-Léonard will eventually lead to a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment on the general human rights situation in Laos and our position. The Commission is closely monitoring the situation by means of our delegation in Vientiane and we are going to continue to analyse the human rights situation and its possible impact on the EC-Laos cooperation programme in view of the joint EC-Laos committee scheduled for next autumn. In this regard, the Commission is always prepared to discuss this issue with the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, until recently I believed that Uganda was one of the better African states in terms of human rights. A fortnight ago Amnesty International, as part of Refugee Week, arranged for MEPs to be partnered with refugees for a day. The reason for doing this was simply to allow politicians to understand at first hand the experiences of people who become refugees and to listen to why they had to escape from their home countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the privilege to meet a Ugandan refugee living in Scotland whose name is Innocent Jakisa. He has been given refugee status to stay permanently in the United Kingdom. His story was shocking. I do not have the time to go into detail here. He was not from the north of the country but was a disabled rights activist who spoke out against his government.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Paragraph 5 of the resolution, calling on the Ugandan Government to introduce good governance and political pluralism, is absolutely vital. Freedom of speech is essential for democracy. Uganda has come a long way from the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin, but there is still much to do. The fact that there are no political parties in Uganda should be a cause for concern to us in the EU and although the president is supposed to lift this 17-year ban on multi-party democracy, subject to referendum, this process needs to be closely monitored by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the substance at hand in the resolution, the treatment of children in the northern part of Uganda is of serious concern. Only a few weeks ago, a number of schoolgirls were abducted by the brutal rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army. If they are not found their fate will be one of sex slaves to militia commanders. According to Jo Becker of Human Rights Watch: 'The increase in abductions is dramatic and alarming.' More children have been taken in the last ten months than in any previous year of the conflict. Since the military offensive by the Ugandan Government, in just over a year, it is estimated that 5 000 children have been abducted. In the year before it was less than 100. In the 17 years of conflict between the Ugandan Government and the LRA, it is estimated that 20 000 children have been abducted.</p>
<p class="contents">Much needs to be done. I hope that in future the children of Uganda will be able to live peacefully and that people like Innocent will have their human rights respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is right to denounce the serious situation in the north of Uganda, with a huge number of abductions of children who are used as child soldiers, sex slaves and carriers; in short, children who, under death threats and in life-threatening circumstances, are kept in slavery or are even required to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for this lies in various quarters. It has already been stated here that the Ugandan Government is no soft touch. It would be useful if the European Union looked closely at all unchecked budgetary aid that goes to Uganda, from the Member States and from us, because Uganda is no model state. There may have been progress in a number of areas, but the reports of systematic cases of torture deserve a close inquiry. This applies, for example, to the cause of death of a certain Mr Murisidi, who died in a police cell.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Uganda leaves the population at the mercy of the terror of the ‘Lord's Resistance Army’. It is unable to guarantee the safety of the people of the northern province and neither has it succeeded in involving the LRA in peace talks, despite increased military expenditure on the part of Uganda and despite Uganda's military presence in the east of Congo where their presence is apparently more lucrative.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Sudan, however, does not get off scot-free either. Sudan denies any responsibility in the crimes of the LRA's rebels. It is obvious that these receive weapons from the Sudanese army itself. I have the testimony of religious leaders who described in detail a huge arms delivery, in mid-March 2003, of bombs, various types of grenades, and hundreds of boxes containing everything from bullets to uniforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, as long as the LRA is armed, they will shoot, kill, and abduct children rather than negotiate peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The escalation of the conflict in northern Uganda<span class="bold"> </span>is reaching unprecedented levels and is causing a genuine humanitarian crisis. Approximately a million people have been displaced in Acholiland and in the Lango and Iteso regions. At the beginning of the year, the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative seemed to have achieved unmatchable results. A number of meetings were held between the religious leaders and the rebels; a presidential peace commission was even set up with many responsibilities; the LRA and the government called for a cease-fire. In May, for the first time, the Consultative Group Meeting discussed the crisis in northern Uganda as a national issue, and there were substantial contributions from civil society. Despite these small rays of hope, the conflict has been deteriorating severely over the past two months. For the first time since the start of this distressing affair, rebel activity has intensified and has carried on for over six months, breaking the traditional mould of cycles of violence which initially took the form of brief raids rather than permanent conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, it has become clear from the LRA’s order to attack Catholic missions that the Sudanese Government has renewed its support for the LRA, providing sophisticated heavy armaments. Joseph Kony, the leader of the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army, spoke again last Monday, telling his men to kill mercilessly anyone who comes within range, including the elderly and children, to spare only pregnant women, to kill priests and missionaries in cold blood and to beat up nuns in cold blood. The crazy orders were given over the frequency used by the network of two-way radios belonging to the Catholic missions of northern Uganda. Indeed, the rebels are able to use the same two-way radios in their internal communications as those used by missionaries for they have plundered numerous Catholic parish churches in recent months. Moreover, despite the fact that the humanitarian situation is getting worse and that rebel activity is clearly on the increase, the Ugandan Government has announced that the situation is still under control. In this regard, I must highlight the prodigious efforts of the European Commission to help these people, not least through monitoring in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">At this confusing time, marked by violence, terror and war, the real danger is that of resorting to weapon-power as the only way of addressing this serious situation. Moreover, there is also the risk that the international community and citizens will hide behind indifference, treating this disaster as the concern of the Acholi people alone. We have to take notice of the cries of the people and the leaders of Acholiland: sadly, their story has already proven that peace can never be achieved by forcing a people into submission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issues that are addressed under the emergency procedure, and today provides yet another example of this, deal with extremely important matters. I would, therefore, like us to consider the possibility of not always tabling human rights for Thursday afternoon, when only a few Members are present. I believe that issues as serious as human rights and freedom of expression deserve that this item be moved from time to time to a more suitable point on the agenda, when more Members are present.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Uganda, this country has for a long time been considered to be a window onto development in East Africa. Today, however, it is the worst location for attacks on physical integrity and for breaches of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday’s slaves were kidnapped, thrown into ships’ holds and traded for goods or money. Having cleared their consciences – particularly in Durban where they condemned slavery as a crime against humanity – western countries ended up forgetting that other forms of slavery still exist. Today, slaves do not wear chains or work in cotton fields, slavery does not need the colour issue to stamp its authority more thoroughly on black people whose souls have been destroyed. No! Slavery today takes the form of so-called resistance armies that claim to serve self-proclaimed ‘lords’ and all of this results in the tragedy with which we are familiar today: that of child soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Child soldiers, it should be pointed out, are children who, as Kourouma explains very well in his book, are forced to kill a member of their family in order to become a child soldier. They are sexually exploited, as has already been said. There are around 20 000 such children in Uganda today and one reason why this tragedy is allowed to happen is that a whole host of countries is giving logistical, financial and military assistance to countries such as Sudan and Uganda.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say that in this regard too, I have the feeling that our own policies employ double standards. A few weeks ago, I visited Togo, a country to which, perhaps rightly, we have refused to give aid in the fields of health and education. It is, therefore, being punished. At the same time, a country such as Uganda is being supported by the United States. At the same time, conventions that we have signed up to, such as ‘Everything but Arms’, are not being duly applied in Uganda, where arms trading still goes on throughout the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish I could be sure that all the conventions on trade on the ground, of weapons in particular, were being properly implemented in countries such as Uganda. I also wish I could be sure that the various conventions that we have signed are more than just labels to ease our consciences, because signing up to the convention protecting the rights of the child or to an entire set of conventions intended to protect basic rights does not mean that we can carry on acting as if nothing were wrong. If the serious attacks on human rights, the breaches of children’s rights and the murders are the everyday lot of Ugandans, we must shoulder our responsibilities. This does not mean conducting a policy that employs double standards; it means real sanctions and monitoring the aid with which we provide that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is total anarchy in northern Uganda, and the ‘Lord's Army’ does everything that God forbids. It is inconceivable that these incredible villains can continue to descend on schools and kidnap women and children in order to turn them into sex slaves or forced soldiers.

<p class="contents">It is, however, lamentable that, even if the Ugandan army were to concentrate on Uganda, that would not resolve the problem, as the Ugandan army and government are part of the problem rather than a means of dealing with it. That is why we need a clear-cut policy here. We must first see to it that the Sudanese attacks on Uganda, along with other interventions by outsiders, are stopped; then, secondly, we also have to get the Ugandans to put a stop to their own incursions into neighbouring countries; thirdly, Uganda needs to make a start on using the police and armed forces, under the rule of law, to do away with the criminal elements, a process that must go hand in hand with a process of reconciliation and negotiation, leading progressively to the setting up in Uganda of something like genuine democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This country has had much to endure under various dictators, through several wars, and at the hands of diverse criminal elements. It is vitally necessary to restore the precarious balance between the tribes and ethnic groups of this country, whose diversity is known to us from the days of the Kingdom of Buganda under the Kabaka, which also includes many, many other ancient kingdoms and tribes and will have a democratic future only on the basis of the rule of law and if the balance of races and ethnic groups is carefully maintained.</p>

First of all it says that the LRA has a complex political agenda. The agenda is one insane man pretending to receive messages from the Holy Spirit that he should rule Uganda according to the Ten Commandments. Since this agenda has no public appeal, Kony abducts children to lead his war. He has no intention whatever of negotiating with anyone about a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to stop the atrocities is to make sure that Kony has no way of receiving arms. Nevertheless it is a fact that the Sudanese commander has supplied Kony with massive amounts of arms, which has enabled him to carry out the recent abductions. Even if the Sudanese Government has no part in this, it is responsible for its army's actions. I therefore urge Sudan to ensure that none of Sudan's armed forces will ever again be able to arm the LRA and bring about the unspeakable suffering of thousands of children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is therefore pleased with Parliament's initiative to expose the suffering of the people of that region.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with Parliament that we must condemn the campaign of terror being carried out by the Lord's Resistance Army, with its murders and kidnappings. The lack of security created by its activity is a significant obstacle to humanitarian aid, since it restricts access and endangers both the humanitarian aid workers and the civilian population, in addition to all the other problems you have pointed out very effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">You have raised the issue of what the Union is doing. At the moment the Union is providing significant humanitarian assistance and support, by means of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), in so far as the security measures allow it. The assistance is being provided in the form of health care and food support, increasing the availability of drinking water and improving the sanitation system, providing seed and tools, in order to guarantee food security, and distributing basic necessities such as shelters and blankets. This week, the Director of ECHO has been in the area participating in the tasks of increasing our resources, in order to deal with the current needs, and the assistance we are providing this year will be equivalent to EUR 4 million, double that of last year, and it will be increased by a further 2 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing aid is clearly not everything, however. We will also have to see to what extent this aid can be used as a lever for achieving other results. The main donor countries are holding a dialogue with the Ugandan Government in order to promote a policy in the north to facilitate the full integration of the northern districts into the rest of the country. The Commission's delegation is chairing the group of donors which is studying the problems affecting the northern region and, especially, trying to resolve the problem of the children.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally using the lever of financial resources to make progress in the right direction. The first tranche of budgetary aid, from the Eighth European Development Fund (EDF), was released once the condition not to spend more than 2% of the total budget for military purposes was fulfilled, and the decision to release further tranches will depend on what agreement can be reached with the government of Uganda on the appropriate conditions for its use.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is preparing, together with the government, a programme for the rehabilitation of the north, a particularly difficult area. We believe that the difference in standard of living between the north and the rest of the country is one of the fundamental causes, as well as the consequence, of the persistent instability and insecurity. However, we believe that, if we had other external support, our actions would be much more effective. The Commission would therefore be very glad to see greater involvement by the African Union in the efforts to find a lasting solution to the problem, which would then allow us to deal with the problems faced in other areas which you have referred to in your speeches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Specifically, I refer to a report to the effect that my group had lost a vote, even though, according to the Rules of Procedure, we had won it. The vote was on Amendment No 17 to the Lisi report. There were 457 of us here in the Chamber for the vote. In Germany, there is a novel entitled ‘Der Sommer, der ein Winter war’ – I do not know what it was called when translated into other languages, but I think we can start writing a novel entitled ‘The Thursday that was a Friday’. I would like to ask the bureau to find out whether a majority of our Members want to ascertain whether the last 50 cents of our allowances were spent on a stamp or whether we might perhaps do some real legislative work here on a Thursday. A vote by 457 Members, 160 of them voting against, means that we are, in some sense, neutering ourselves as a legislative body with the power of codecision. This state of affairs has to be stopped, and measures must be introduced in order to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>An extremely serious rail accident has recently occurred at Chinchilla (Albacete province, Castilla-La Mancha region), just a few months after a similar one occurred at Tobarra, on the same line.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Chinchilla accident (which, as at 5 June, had left 16 dead, 10 missing and 39 injured) was due to the fact that a passenger train collided with a goods train on a single-track line which lacked any automated traffic-control devices. Just before the accident happened a hazardous substance (sulphuric acid) had been unloaded from the goods train, which prevented an exponential increase in the scale of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The general public's response to such accidents is to ask what action the European Union is taking in order to investigate and prevent such occurrences.</p>

<p>(IT) The Council would like to reiterate its deepest regret regarding the very serious rail accident in Chinchilla, Spain.</p>
<p>Whilst recalling that the adoption of measures to improve transport safety is an objective of the common transport policy, as established by the Treaty, the Council points out that the continuous improvement of rail safety on the European level is currently being addressed, by both European Parliament and Council, in the framework of the co-decision procedure for a Directive on safety on the Community's railways. The establishment of the European Railway Agency - which is the subject of a separate proposal - also forms an important element in this process. The Council adopted its Common on the 'Second Railway Package' on the occasion of its meeting (Agriculture) 11-26 June 2003 and has forwarded them to the European Parliament for a second reading in accordance with the co-decision procedure.</p>
<p>Taking into account article 42 of the proposal on a European Railway Agency, which proposes that the Agency shall be operational within 24 months of the entry into force of this Regulation, and without prejudice to the further proceedings within the context of the co-decision procedure, the Agency may be expected to become operational in 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0388"></a>

<p>On 9 June 2003, two Turkish F-16 fighter planes harassed an Olympic Airways aircraft on the Athens-Istanbul route, placing the lives of the passengers in direct danger. The aircraft’s automatic crash avoidance safety system was triggered and Greek fighter planes were forced to intercept the Turkish planes.</p>
<p>This action constitutes a clear contravention of the rules of international law and, more specifically, a violation of European Union airspace and thus of its territorial integrity, placing the safety of EU citizens in danger, and represents a violation of fundamental standards of international conduct, such as those enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the United Nations Charter and included within the Copenhagen criteria. It is a reflection of a systematic Turkish policy which leads to tension in relations between Greece and Turkey and directly threatens the peace and security of the region. In view of these facts, what urgent steps does the Council intend to take to put a stop to such aggressive acts by Turkey and to prevent their repetition in the future, and what consequences will the Turkish strategy adopted to date have on the assessment of the country’s progress towards EU membership?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council is aware of the incident mentioned by the honourable Member. It is also aware of information about claims for an increasing number of violations of Greek airspace by Turkish military aircraft, and of the sensitivity of this question - as well as of other issues relating to the Aegean - in Greece. Such incidents do unfortunately contrast with the general improvement in neighbourhood relations between Greece and Turkey over the recent years since 1999.</p>
<p>The Council considers that Turkey, as a candidate State, must - under the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the UN Charter - make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes and other related issues, as referred to in point 4 of the Helsinki conclusions. This is reflected in a specific priority of the revised Turkey Accession Partnership. In line with the Helsinki conclusions, the European Council will have to review the situation in this area, including its repercussions on the accession process, before the end of 2004.</p>
<p>In the framework of political dialogue, the Council is regularly encouraging Turkey to continue making efforts to prevent tensions - for instance through confidence building measures in sensitive areas - and to work together with its neighbour towards reaching an understanding on issues where views and interpretation of relevant international law are diverging.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0390"></a>

<p>3.	As clearly stated in the EU's 2002 Annual Report on Human Rights,</p>
<p>'The EU is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances. That stance is rooted in a belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings. The EU uses all relevant international and regional fora to advocate the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p>In countries that retain the death penalty, the EU aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and urges respect for the minimum standards set out in international human rights instruments and other documents, notably the 'EU Guidelines towards third countries on the death penalty', adopted by the European Council in June 1998.'</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0397"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council is very closely following developments in Cyprus. It considers that any action likely to generate tensions and to damage the prospects of reaching peace and of reunifying the island must be avoided.</p>
<p>The best way for the European Union to respond to developments of the kind the honourable Member is pointing out is to continue to strongly support further efforts to move towards a comprehensive Cyprus settlement, in the framework of the UN. The Council stays firmly committed to this, as just confirmed at the Thessaloniki European Council.</p>
<p>In the 2003 Accession Partnership for Turkey, strong support to efforts to find a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem has been identified as a priority.</p>
<p>In order to help creating favourable conditions for moving towards a settlement, the Council also supports measures likely to bring about practical improvements on the ground and to bring people from either part of the island closer together. Such measures have been announced in the recent Commission communication on promoting economic development in the northern part of Cyprus.

<p>(IT) The Council would recall that its Office in New York was established in 1994 after the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union, as a direct consequence of the implementation of the CFSP. The Office had to provide Secretariat support and services in order to facilitate the implementation of Articles 11, 12 and 19 of the new Treaty, and liaise with the United Nations on issues going beyond Community competence.</p>
<p>The subsequent development of the CFSP and, significantly, the emergence of the European Security and Defence Policy, already accounting for three crisis-management operations under UN mandate, have rendered necessary the reinforcement of the Office, which is gradually taking place. As from 1 August 2003, the staff complement will be as follows:</p>
<p>1 A1, 2 A4, 1 A5, 1 B1, 1 B5, 4 C</p>
<p>Before envisaging any further reinforcement, synergies with the Delegation of the Commission are being explored. In this perspective, it is foreseen that the Offices of both Institutions will move into the same premises, fitted with larger meeting rooms and a common entrance, by the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in periods of intense activity, Member States put some of their facilities at the disposal of the EU for coordination activities. Any further pooling of assets seems, however, premature: as things stand, only States are members of the UN, and the Member States have distinct legal personalities and a distinct role therein.</p>
<p>As far as coordination with third states is concerned, participation of the acceding countries has not had a major impact and has not required substantial adaptations. Meeting rooms are however stretched to the maximum capacity and restrictions have been imposed on the number of participants (maximum 1 per delegation at the table). The situation is expected to improve after the move to the new premises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0410"></a>

<p>During this parliamentary term, the European Parliament and the Commission have been very committed to improving the situation of children in Romania. I was, however, dismayed to note the Council’s answer to my Oral Question (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0275_EN.html">H-0275/03</a><a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>): ‘which indicated that no real progress had been made in respect of the political criterion relating to children.’</p>
<p>A recent briefing document for the EP includes the following statement: ‘concerns persist about the significant regional differences in the implementation of the reform programme (for child protection)’. There are also frequent reports of the deaths of children and young people who have been expelled from orphanages without having a secure environment to which to return. Furthermore, on 22 May, the Romanian press reported that the moratorium on international adoptions was to continue, which means that the legislation needed is not ready, in spite of huge international efforts and aid provided by the High-Level Group on the initiative of Baroness Nicholson.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for the lack of progress in the reform of childcare in Romania? What measures will the Council take to inform the Romanian authorities of the EU’s serious concerns?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is aware, in the case of Romania one of the specific areas covered by the pre-accession strategy is that of childcare, an important issue on which the Council has already had the opportunity to respond to questions in this assembly. The Presidency can confirm that the Union continues and will continue to closely monitor the situation in this regard.</p>
<p>In the revised Accession Partnership for Romania that was adopted by the Council on last 19 May, inter alia it should be underlined that the priorities and intermediate objectives include the stipulation that Romania should: 'Continue the reform of the public child care system in accordance with the National Strategy on the Protection of Children in Difficulty, by focussing on closure of old-style institutions, de-institutionalisation and prevention of institutionalisation through provision of alternative social services for families and children'. The issue was also recently mentioned at Ministerial level at the latest meeting of the EU-Romania Association Council.</p>
<p>The Union continues to urge the Romanian authorities to make further efforts in this area. However the progress already made should not be underestimated, as noted in the Commission's 2002 Regular Report on Romania's progress towards accession. In particular, the number of children in residential care has been reduced, from 50 000 in 2001 to 43 000 in 2002, through other solutions such as assistance to families, foster care, family type homes and national adoption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to latest information available, existing regional differences in the implementation of the reform are likely to decrease in the near future, as best practices on child protection will be extended.</p>
<p>As regards the current moratorium on international adoptions, the Romanian government has prepared new legislation on children's rights, including legislation on adoptions, which will be submitted to Parliament as soon as possible. An independent group of experts in family law of the Member States of the European Union is examining this legislation and will transmit their opinion to the Romanian government soon. In the meantime, in the revised Accession Partnership, the EU has maintained the view that the moratorium on adoptions should remain in place until new legislation compatible with the best interests of the child and Romania's international obligations is in place and the administrative capacity to implement the new legislation is ensured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The question of rural employment cannot be taken out of the wider context of the European Employment Strategy (EES), as defined by the 1997 Luxembourg Extraordinary European Council on Employment.</p>
<p>The 2000 Extraordinary Lisbon European Council set the goal of full employment and, in the medium-term, the goal of an overall employment rate of 70% (60% for women), to be achieved by 2010.</p>
<p>The 2001 Stockholm European Council set as intermediate targets for 2005 overall employment rates of 67% (57% for women).</p>
<p>The five-year review of the European Employment Strategy (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0416">COM (2002) 416</a> final) notes that over 10 million jobs (6 million of which are filled by women) were created in the five-year period 1997 to 2001.</p>
<p>The Council considers it of primary importance that the European Union should guarantee the application of the principle of equal opportunities for men and women living in rural areas and believes that the participation of women is vitally important to strengthen the new European rural model.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Agriculture Council approved the conclusions on the valuable contribution of women to rural development, which were based on the Spanish Presidency’s memorandum and the results of the work of the Conference on Gender Mainstreaming organised jointly by the Presidency and the Commission in Santander (Spain) in June 2002.</p>
<p>The Commission has consolidated the policies seeking to strengthen the role of women working in agriculture through the implementation of awareness-raising campaigns intended to bring about recognition of the contribution that women working in rural areas make to the economy and society, to encourage associationism, to encourage the promotion and creation of information channels and networks and to promote training and technical assistance programmes. These programmes, which have developed through Community initiatives, concern access to the labour market and training for women and provide for specific funding for women with entrepreneurial projects or the promotion of social infrastructure in rural areas. In view of these initiatives, the Commission has purposefully included specific provisions on the promotion of female employment in rural areas in the package of legislative proposals on CAP reform.</p>
<p>Moreover, in anticipation of a subsequent Council review, in the first half of 2003, the Presidency launched a debate on employment in rural areas on the basis of a working document, examined as a preliminary measure by the Special Committee on Agriculture on 2 June last. The debate, which addresses, inter alia, the issue of the promotion of female employment in rural areas, will be developed during the second half of 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On a number of occasions the European Union has said that political negotiation is the only viable solution to the armed conflict in Colombia. Broad sections of Colombian society see a humanitarian agreement as the first step towards guaranteeing greater protection for the civilian population. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) stated in April 2002 that the international community should reject any move to involve the civilian population of Colombia in the conflict or any other expression of support for violence. The new government, in proposing the creation of the ‘democratic security policy’, is trying to involve the civilian population in the internal armed conflict by means of networks of informants, peasant soldiers and civilian guards.</p>
<p>What steps is the Council taking to bring about the adoption of a humanitarian agreement between the two sides which would ensure a distinction is made between the civilian population and soldiers?</p>

<p>(IT) The Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarians to refer to its conclusions on Colombia, adopted last December, which perfectly summarise the EU's position on all matters. On this occasion,</p>
<p>'the Council welcomed President Uribe’s efforts to reform his country’s institutions and to develop a fully functioning democratic state throughout the territory of Colombia, based on the respect for human rights and the welfare and safety of all its citizens. The Council also expressed its support to the Government of Colombia in its fight against terrorism as well as against illegal drug trafficking. It hoped for strengthened co-operation within the region in these areas.</p>
<p>The Council reiterated its full support to the efforts of President Uribe to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Colombia and underlined the importance it attaches to the contribution of the UN Special Adviser on Colombia in this process. The Council expressed the readiness of the EU to assist the Colombian Government in reaching a peaceful settlement of the Conflict.</p>
<p>The Council expressed deep concern with respect to the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the situation of human rights in Colombia, and urged the Colombian Government to increase its efforts in these areas and take effective action against impunity and collusion.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the political and economic reforms announced by President Uribe, with a view to address existing inequalities within the country and promotes sustainable development. At the same time the Council called upon the Colombian Government to recognise and support the role of civil society and Non Governmental Organisations as important stakeholders in carrying out these reforms and moving towards a negotiated settlement of the internal armed conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council called upon Member States and the Commission to enhance the EU work programme with the aim to contribute to the strengthening of state institutions, the alleviation of the humanitarian crisis and the search for alternatives to drugs production.</p>
<p>The interventions of the EU should be prepared in close consultation with the Government of Colombia, the UN and the international community in Bogotá.'</p>
<p>This position was reiterated at various meetings with Colombian authorities, and also made public.</p>
<p>The EU is aware of the risks of involving the civilian population in the internal armed conflict and continues to actively support appropriate measures to bring about a negotiated solution to the conflict in Colombia - including by eradicating long-term economic and social causes of it. Wherever possible, this is done in close co-ordination with other donors and interested partners - inside and outside the region.</p>
<p>The meeting on 10 July in London is meant to prepare a future possible 'Donors Table'. The preparation of this meeting is actively pursued. At this occasion, the EU intends to send a clear message on the need for a comprehensive response to the crisis.</p>
<p>The EU urges all Parties in the conflict to accept a negotiated solution. It strongly condemned the recent murders and kidnappings.</p>
<p>The EU strongly believes that, above all at this time, it is necessary to avoid the further escalation of violence and every effort should be made to start up again as soon as possible the concrete search for a humanitarian agreement and a negotiated political solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>As concerns impunity, it is essential that future possible agreements do not grant impunity wholesale to the members of the illegal armed groups that have committed atrocities against the civilian population. Furthermore, it is important that the remaining issues concerning the affected civilian population be addressed, both in view of possible compensation as to the importance of a safe return for those who have been forcefully displaced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0419"></a>

The decision envisages a comprehensive agreement leading to the creation of an 'open aviation area' between and within the United States and the European Union. The signing and the conclusion of any agreement which may result from these negotiations must, under Article 300(2) of the Treaty, be the subject of a further Council Decision based on a proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p>The voting procedure for this decision depends on the content of the draft agreement resulting from the negotiations. The Council shall decide by a qualified majority except if the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules. Regarding the involvement of the EP, a first reading opinion on the draft regulation on the negotiation and implementation of air services agreements between Member States and third countries has already been requested and is due to be adopted in September.</p>

<p>(EN) The Italian presidency of the Council shares the opinion of the honourable Member of Parliament that the drugs problem remains a major cause for concern throughout the European Union.</p>
<p>For this purpose a comprehensive program, based on the leading principles of continuity, coordination, consistency and efficiency, has been drawn up for the second semester of 2003. Key elements are concrete actions listed in agreed implementation papers on demand and supply reduction and synthetic drugs. Moreover the EU Action Plan on drugs with the Western Balkans, endorsed on 5 June 2003, will be in a first implementation phase. Work on the Action Plans on Central Asia and the Latin America/Caribbean will be carried forward specially after the successful meeting on 29-30 May 2003 in Cartagena with Latin American/Caribbean partners. The Italian presidency, as specific initiatives, has presented texts for resolutions on the Balkans, driving and drugs, training of drugs law enforcement officers in assistance of New Member States and Candidate Countries and the role of the family in prevention.</p>
<p>A meeting of the national drugs co-ordinators will be held in November 2003 in Rome with a special focus on coordination of external assistance.</p>
<p>The presidency intends to implement its program in full cooperation with the incoming EU Presidencies, Commission, Europol and the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0425"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council is not aware of the complaints to which the honourable Member is referring with regard to the homepage of the General Secretariat of the Council’s website.</p>
<p>The General Secretariat of the Council is starting to update the Council’s website, which will thus be fully revamped shortly.</p>
<p>Over and above issues of presentation, the honourable Member is aware that the Council’s website provides an exhaustive collection of information on the Council’s activities.</p>
<p>For example, it provides topical information under the ‘Newsroom’ heading, provided by the Council press service, which contains, inter alia, information notes on the Council’s sessions before the sessions and, at the end of each session, detailed press releases. In addition, when European Council meetings are held, special pages are created which provide comprehensive information on the meetings.</p>
<p>Another example is the ‘Transparency’ heading, which provides access to the public register of Council documents.</p>
<p>The public register, which has been operational since January 1999, is a database which provides access to various types of Council documents such as agendas, information notes, outcomes of proceedings, reports etc., as soon as they are produced or, in the case of legislative acts, after they have been adopted by the Council deliberating in its capacity as legislator.</p>
<p>On 3 June 2003, the register of Council documents contained 410 525 document references, including 208 611 documents accessible to the public. In 2002, the Council’s public register was visited by 950 000 citizens.</p>
<p>In 2002, the Council website as a whole received 6 310 729 visits, with a total of 37 111 913 pages consulted.</p>
<p>Thus, the pressure groups and lobbies may, if they so desire, follow the Council’s decision-making process using the above-mentioned tools, which are in addition to other steps taken by the Council to ensure transparency, such as opening up deliberations to the public, public debates and provision for direct contact with officials in accordance with the code of good administrative behaviour, which governs the relations of Council officials with the public.</p>
<p>Moreover, when ministerial meetings are held, as many representatives of professional organisations as there are seats available may be admitted to the press room.</p>
<p>Turning to the specific question raised by the honourable Member regarding the possibility of regulating the Council’s relations with pressure groups, the Council is not considering this possibility for the moment.</p>
<p>Since the Council deliberates solely at the proposal of the Commission when it deliberates in the capacity of legislator in first pillar sectors, it would appear appropriate for consultation with interested parties to be carried out by the Commission in accordance with the rules the Commission has established for itself (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0704">COM (2002) 704</a> final).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0403"></a>

<p>The plan to amend the plant protection directive (2000/29/EC<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) may have serious consequences for Finnish industry. In addition to those difficulties, the amendment may also have implications for the Union's external relations. The amendment of the directive would entail a deterioration in conditions in neighbouring areas. A case in point is timber exports from Russia to Finland which have been carried out for 100 years with no particular problem. The flora and fauna of the two countries are identical. Studies have shown that there is no risk of insects harmful to conifers in the relevant areas of Russia. The Finnish plant protection inspection authorities have been checking timber imported from the western regions of Russia for many years and no alarming observations have been made. The requirement that each consignment of conifers should be certified is therefore unreasonable.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share our view that the directive does not need amending? If it is not possible to avoid it, is it possible to leave the neighbouring areas outside the scope of the directive?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has been preparing and discussing with Member States a draft Commission Directive aiming at amending the annexes to Directive 2000/29/EC to strengthen, amongst others, some of the protective provisions as regards the import of wood originating in the European part of Russia.</p>

<p>(EN) The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> published by the World Health Organisation aims ‘to contribute to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breast-feeding, and by ensuring the proper use of breast-milk substitutes, when these are necessary, on the basis of adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution’. Within the Community, Commission Directive 91/321/EEC<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on infant formulae and follow-on formulae regulates the compositional requirements and marketing practices for these products. The application of these rules in the Member States is the responsibility of national authorities.</p>
<p>The Community cannot legislate for third countries. Therefore, it is for these countries to take the necessary measures to apply the World Health Organisation (WHO) Code in their territory as appropriate. However, Council Resolution 92/C 172/01<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on marketing practices for breast-milk substitutes in third countries by Community-based manufacturers encourages compliance with the WHO Code. It also offers to examine any complaints about or criticisms of marketing practices, in third countries, of a Community-based manufacturer if those complaints are notified by the competent authorities of third countries.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that the Resolution has been put into effect. The Community has instructed its delegations in third countries to serve as contact points for the competent authorities to notify any such complaints.</p>
<p>Certain non-governmental organisations have contacted Commission delegations concerning inappropriate marketing practices of Community-based manufacturers of infant formulae or follow-on formulae. However, complaints from non-governmental organisations are not covered by the framework of the Resolution. No complaints have been received to date from the competent authorities of third countries.</p>
<p>The honourable Member has asked the Commission to consider revising the Resolution so that complaints or criticisms from non-governmental organisations can be examined. This issue was extensively discussed during the adoption of the Resolution and it was clear that the Community and the Commission could not receive and pursue the examination of such complaints in the territory of a third country. Therefore the Commission strongly believes that it is not appropriate to revise the Resolution and that only complaints submitted by the competent authorities in third countries can be accepted and examined by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) According to the Court, the main objective of the treatment operation within the plant determines whether recovery or disposal takes place. The operation is recovery only if the waste replaces the use of natural resources. Reclamation of heat as a secondary effect of an operation whose principal objective is waste disposal, although positive in itself, does not affect the classification of the operation as a disposal operation. The Court also stated that shipment of waste in order for it to be incinerated in a processing plant designed to dispose of waste cannot be regarded as having the recovery of waste as principal objective, even if when the waste is incinerated all or part of the heat produced by the combustion is reclaimed.<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> In the Luxembourg-case, the Commission argued that incineration of waste where the energy is recovered in full or in part should be classified as a recovery operation. However, this was rejected by the Court.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of the honourable Member is therefore that, according to these judgements, incineration with energy recovery is regarded as disposal if that is the main purpose of the operations. As stated in the Communication towards a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission is still evaluating the consequences of the Court judgement with a view to take into consideration all legal, technical as well as economical aspects. This will involve contacts with Member States and stakeholders. The Commission would also welcome all input from other institutions, in particular from the Parliament and its Members to this process.</p>
<p>The potential influence of the judgements on the development of incineration capacity in the Member States is difficult to predict because investment decisions depend on a number of legal, economic and local circumstances.</p>
<p>In view of the available information, the classification of incineration within certain plants as disposal would not prevent the attainment of the reduction targets for landfill of biodegradable waste. The Landfill Directive requires that biodegradable waste is not put into landfills, however, it does not require such waste to be recovered. Furthermore, there are other ways of treating biodegradable waste, such as recycling, composting, bio-methanisation and use as fuel in a production plant.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2065/2001 lays down detailed rules as regards consumer information about fishery and aquaculture products. Those products on sale at retailers should show the commercial designation of the species, the production method and the area where the fish was caught. For farmed products, the indication of the catch area consists of a reference to the Member State or third country in which the product undergoes the final development stage. Where the product is farmed in several Member States or third countries, the marketing Member State may authorise the indication of those Member States or third countries. The Regulation also allows operators to provide more precise information on the catch area.</p>
<p>According to Regulation 2065/2001 of 22 October 2001, the correct information for farmed salmon whose final development stage took place in Scotland is 'salmon farmed in the UK'. It is also possible to add a reference to Scotland and display 'salmon farmed in the UK (Scotland).' In instances where the product was farmed in both Norway and Scotland, the United Kingdom may authorise the indication 'salmon farmed in Norway and the UK' or 'salmon farmed in Norway and the UK (Scotland).'</p>
<p>In the case mentioned by the honourable Member, it is not clear whether 'sourced in Scotland or Norway' is the only available information about the product for the consumer. Should this be the case, the description provided by the British supermarket would not comply with Regulation 2065/2001. Not only does this information not correspond to the requirements of the Regulation but also it is clearly misleading as to the real origin of the product ('Scotland or Norway') and the method of production ('sourced').</p>
<p>It should also be noted that control and enforcement of Regulation 2065/2001 falls under the responsibility of the Member States. Under Article 9 of the Regulation, Member States are bound to put into place regulatory measures concerning traceability and controls.</p>
<p>However, the Commission notes that a demand from the United Kingdom for the registration of the denomination 'Scottish farmed salmon' as a Protected Geographical Indication is in the process of examination by the Commission services under Regulation (EEC) 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.'</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0371"></a>

Greece has indicated for all stations that limit values are exceeded due to natural events, stating that 'a project is being carried out concerning the impact of natural reasons' as reference to justification. So far no PM2.5 data has been submitted by Greece. Data for the year 2002 is due by September 2003.</p>

<p>The Commission recently received a 'Systematic review of health aspects of air quality in Europe' from the World Health Organisation. According to this report long-term exposure to current ambient PM concentrations may lead to a marked reduction in life expectancy. The reduction in life expectancy is primarily due to increased cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality. Increases are likely in lower respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function in children, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and reduced lung function in adults. Results from the APHEA2 project indicate that effects of PM10 on mortality are more severe at higher nitrogendioxid (NO2) levels and in warmer climates.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The laggoon of Vasova is part of the site 'Delta Nestou and Limnothalasses Keramotis' (GR1150010), while the Bay of Eleftheres is part of the site 'Kolpos Palaiou - Ormos Eleftheron' (GR1150009). Greece has proposed both sites as Sites of Community Interest (SCI) and thus they are part of the Greek proposal of sites to be included in the Natura 2000 network established by Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>With regard to the incorporation of the National Park of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in Natura 2000, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member, that the Common Ministerial Decision 5796/1999 designating the zones of Nestos Delta, lake of Vistonida and lake of Ismarida as a National Park is no longer in force. According to Greek law, the necessary legal framework aiming at the protection of the sites and complying with the objectives set out in Directives 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and 92/43/EEC is composed of an approved management plan (specific environmental study), a Common Ministerial Decision and a Management Body. The Greek authorities have adopted Law 3044/2002 which provides for the establishment of 25 Management Bodies for a number of sites that Greece has already proposed for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network under the Directive 92/43/EEC. According to the provisions of this Law, a Management Body for the area 'Delta of Nestos-Vistonida-Ismarida' has to be established. The process of creation and full operation of all the 25 Management Bodies is about to be finalised. The full establishment of these management bodies is expected to contribute towards the conservation objectives for these areas, the implementation of the approved management plans for the areas and their efficient protection.</p>
<p>As regards Council Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> (EIA Directive), Member States must ensure that, before a development consent is given, projects likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of their nature, size or location are subject to a requirement for development consent and an assessment with regard to their effects.</p>
<p>The projects to which the honourable Member refers to, such as port installations, reservoirs of liquid fuel well as electricity generating units with a combined power of 1560 MW, may fall into the scope of the EIA Directive. Concerning the electricity generating they must ensure that they comply to Directive 2001/20/CE on emissions from Large Combustion Plants so that they minimise the impact of emissions on land, water and the atmosphere. However, it should be noted that, according to Article 1(4) of the Directive, projects serving national defence purposes are not covered. In addition, on the basis of the information submitted, it appears that the procedure for development consent has not started yet.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is assessing several complaints related to the deterioration of the 'Delta of Nestos', principally due to the absence of an appropriate legal framework for its protection and its conservation. The Commission is not aware of the development of other facilities and infrastructure in the sites of Delta of Nestos and Eleftheres Bay.</p>
<p>If the Greek authorities decide to proceed with the construction of the previously described projects, the provisions established by the EIA Directive should be applied. Moreover, as the sites have been designated under Directive 92/43/EEC, the Greek authorities should comply with the provisions and the procedure set out in Article 6 of the Directive. If an infringement of Community environmental law is established, the Commission will not hesitate to take all the appropriate measures, including the initiation of an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An extremely serious rail accident has recently occurred at Chinchilla (Albacete province, Castilla-La Mancha region), just a few months after a similar one occurred at Tobarra, on the same line.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the Chinchilla accident (which, as at 5 June, had left 16 dead, 10 missing and 39 injured) was due to the fact that a passenger train collided with a goods train on a single-track line which lacked any automated traffic-control devices. Just before the accident happened a hazardous substance (sulphuric acid) had been unloaded from the goods train, which prevented an exponential increase in the scale of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The general public's response to such accidents is to ask what action the European Union is taking in order to investigate and prevent such occurrences.</p>

<p>(FR) The causes of the Chinchilla accident are the subject of an inquiry by the competent Spanish authorities, and so we should draw all our conclusions from that at a later date.</p>
<p>The Community's action in the field of rail safety will be stepped up over the coming years with the adoption of the directive on rail safety and the establishment of the European Railways Agency. The directive on rail safety and the regulation establishing the Agency are in the process of being adopted. Parliament should begin the second reading of these texts over the next few weeks. The Commission hopes that they can be adopted as quickly as possible, towards the end of 2003. That would allow us to start setting up the European Railways Agency during 2004.</p>
<p>The safety directive is intended in particular to oblige the Member States to implement a system of independent technical inquiries in the event of accidents (in addition to the judicial inquiry). This technical inquiry should be carried out transparently and the results should prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.</p>
<p>With regard to safety standards, the regulations already affect the transport of dangerous goods by rail (Directive 96/49 of 23 July 1996). Furthermore, the interoperability directives contain fundamental safety requirements affecting the subsystems of the rail system such as signalling and control. These directives are applicable whenever a new line is put into service or an existing line is refurbished.</p>
<p>Finally, the safety directive will allow us to gradually develop common safety objectives and common safety methods. These technical works will be promoted by the European Railways Agency, which will carry out the important task of creating a network of all national rail safety authorities, with a view to sharing experiences and methods for preventing accidents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0391"></a>

<p>On 10 June 2003 the Commission renewed the scientific and technological cooperation agreement with Israel to enable the country to participate in the European Union's Sixth Research Framework Programme (RFP) for the period 2003-2006. Israel is the only non-European country to have been fully involved in the EU's RFP and hence to have enjoyed special advantages. While the Fifth RFP (1998-2002) had been launched with a peace perspective - base, in particular, on the building of infrastructure for a future Palestinian state - the situation is quite different at present. This led the European Parliament to adopt a resolution<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 10 April 2002 calling on the Commission and the Council 'to suspend the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement'.</p>

<p>(FR) The renewal of the scientific and technological cooperation agreement of 22 February 1999 is entirely in line with Parliament and the Council’s approach of opening up the Community’s sixth framework programme for research and technological development to the participation of the Union’s third-country partners. The Commission is convinced that knowledge and science have a fundamental contribution to make to social and economic progress and it is in this spirit that the Union implements its policies on cooperation in the field of scientific and technological research.</p>
<p>With regard in particular to the entry of Israel into the sixth framework programme, the Union’s policy also responds to the Community’s political approach aimed at developing partnerships capable of contributing to the stabilisation of the region. In fact, the Commission believes that the development of relations with Israel will make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process. The renewal of the scientific agreement with Israel was signed on 10 June 2003.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees on the need to ensure the best possible cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the Member States in third countries and international organisations. This includes cooperation between diplomatic missions from Member States and Commission Delegations. This is, indeed, a Treaty requirement enshrined in article 20 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission, together with the Union Presidency and the Council Secretariat, is making significant efforts to achieve that objective. For example, in the case of the New York United Nations (UN) Delegation, a highly successful joint Commission/Presidency/Council Secretariat website accessible in all Community languages is now fully operational, containing detailed information on our cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Delegation and the Delegation of the Council Secretariat at the UN in New York are currently examining establishing in shared premises, which would facilitate significant synergies while providing for a more clearly visible Union presence.</p>
<p>Member States, together with the Commission, regularly coordinate their actions at the UN, as foreseen in article 19 of the TEU. This coordination has gradually increased and now covers the six main committees of the General Assembly and its subordinate bodies, including Economic and Social Committee of the UN (ECOSOC) and the subordinate commissions techniques. More than a thousand internal Union coordination meetings are conducted each year in order to prepare and finalise Union positions. Depending on availability, facilities owned by Member States and by the Union institutions are used as appropriate to coordinate EU positions. In past years, this coordination resulted in the Union achieving a common position on almost 95% of General Assembly votes. The Union has also spoken with one voice in the follow up of all the major conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990’s.</p>
<p>Even though the Commission’s Delegation in New York carries out a very significant volume of activities, current budgetary constraints do not allow, for the time being , to expand its budget. The number of posts for officials currently includes seven Administrators (A-grades), one B-grade and two C-grades, to which a number of temporary personnel must be added (local staff and other agents).</p>
<p>The Commission has recently adopted its Communication on Enlargement and the External Service, which foresees the transformation of Delegations in candidate Countries in representations. For the time being, however, the concrete EU-UN arrangements in the framework of enlargement remain to be agreed.</p>
<p>Without prejudging the outcome of the Inter-Governmental Conference which is currently reflecting on the draft Constitutional Treaty, the Commission is fully committed to work together with the Parliament to continue improving the effectiveness of its External Delegations, at the service of the Union. In addition, the Commission will continue to provide an increasing level of support to the Parliament, for example, arranging programmes for and accompany visiting delegations and Committees where necessary, or providing information and reporting, or through the attendance by Heads of Delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee and other Committees of the Parliament, in order to report on recent developments in their host countries and the development of Union policy and programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0408"></a>

<p>The eastern part of Denmark imports electricity via the Öresund link from Sweden. Under the cooperation agreements between the system operators, Svenska Kraftnät reserves the right to suspend exports at 24 hours notice. Svenska Kraftnät takes advantage of this right in situations where capacity in the Swedish grid is in full use as a result of large quantities of cheap hydro-electric power produced in Norway and northern Sweden in the spring. A shortage of capacity in the electricity transmission systems means that not all production can be transmitted. This problem is resolved by dividing the southern region so as to break the link with eastern Denmark via Öresund. This allows the price in southern Sweden to be lowered while prices in eastern Denmark increase as Swedish imports are replaced by coal-generated electricity.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the transmission capacity constraints in the Southern Sweden and of the fact that these constraints have an effect on the transmission capacity between Sweden and the Eastern Denmark.</p>
<p>The Florence regulatory forum, a bi-annual meeting chaired by the Commission and incorporating regulators, the electricity industry, Member States and consumers, has discussed the issue of discrimination in allocating interconnector capacity between Member States in favour of internal lines in a control area. The conclusions of 6th Forum 10 November 2000 stated: 'Considering the fact that the European continental network is a highly meshed network and that the use of interconnection lines has an effect on the power flows on at least two sides of a political border, it should be ensured that no congestion management procedure with significant effects on power flows in other networks, be devised unilaterally. At least, co-ordination of congestion management procedures on both sides of an interconnection line should be ensured.'</p>
<p>It is thus clear that the regulators and the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) concerned should discuss the method applied.</p>
<p>Moreover, a Regulation on Cross-Border trade in electricity that has now been adopted contains guidelines for congestion management. These guidelines will be discussed in the next Florence forum in Rome 8-9 July 2003, and they will enter into force in July 2004. The issue of discrimination of interconnectors is one of the key items regarding the guidelines.</p>

<p>(EN) The donors’ meeting on Colombia that will take place in London on 10 July will be of a political, not a technical character. It is not meant to be a pledging meeting. But it will be a good opportunity to explain the Union’s perception of the situation in this country, to agree on priorities for the use of the Union's assistance, and to review the implementation of the pledges made at the previous donor’s meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission is fostering EU co-ordination towards a common EU position. The EU will reiterate in London its support for a negotiated solution to the conflict. Furthermore it will stress the importance it attaches to the good offices of the United Nations (UN) in this respect, as well as insist on the need for a comprehensive response to the crisis, that will include dealing with the socio-economic causes of the conflict, protecting human rights, providing humanitarian assistance, and partnership with the civil society and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The fight against impunity and respect for international humanitarian law, in particular the non-involvement of the civilian population in the conflict, is central to the EU's policy towards Colombia as is its support to the role of the UN in Colombia. This position has been repeatedly expressed in EU statements, and in the conclusions of the External Relations Council of December 2002. While supporting a peaceful settlement of the conflict, the EU stands by the conditions set out by the UN for a dialogue with any of the illegal armed groups and is adamant that a negotiated solution should not affect the right of the victims to justice, truth and reparation.</p>
<p>The Commission has raised in discussions with the Colombian government the fight against impunity and the fight against collusion between elements of the Colombian armed forces and paramilitaries. The Commission also promotes through its cooperation instruments:</p>
<p>administrative and judicial reform for which € 10,5 million has been earmarked in the budget for cooperation with the Colombian government (budget line B7-310); and</p>
<p>human rights defenders who fight impunity through the ‘European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights’ (budget chapter B7-70); 14 human rights projects for a total amount of € 13,4 million are now in operation. The Commission’s partners in these endeavour are NGOs, Colombian independent institutions such as the Ombudsman, and international organisations such as the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0421"></a>

It considers that the role of the Commission has been maintained overall, and indeed consolidated in certain areas. However, it also takes the view that the institutional balance and clarification of the role of the institutions are still unsatisfactory because of the provisions on the make-up of the Commission and the definition of the office of a more permanent president of the European Council. Also, the provisions relating to Community policies need to be reviewed in order to bring them into line with the realities of an enlarged Union.</p>

<p>Five years after the liberalisation of the electricity market in Spain the positive impact on competition it entailed have been neutralised by the dominant companies, which control almost 80% of supply and in effect determine the prices on the electricity market.</p>
<p>This is jeopardising the competitiveness of many SMEs, in particular Spanish textile companies, which are already experiencing serious difficulties because of fierce competition from developing countries with much lower wage costs and from 2005 onwards will have to cope with the elimination of quantitative restrictions.</p>
<p>In the light of all this, does the Commission intend to take any steps to put an end to what is virtually a monopoly and to allow the cross-border flow of electricity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Whilst a problem of interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries, does exist with respect to Spain, the development of the internal electricity market has nonetheless already shown positive effects : the prices of electricity in Spain have fallen consistently since 1997, as shown by Eurostat data, showing a clear positive effect on the liberalisation process.</p>
<p>Although 83% of installed capacity in Spain is controlled by the three largest generators, there are almost 150 suppliers, and more than half of the large eligible customers have been able to take advantage of the new competitive environment by switching their supplier or re-negotiating their supply contracts, as evidenced in the Commission’s Second Benchmarking Report<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Furthermore, it is important to note that the Electricity Directive has been effectively implemented in Spain: the Regulatory authority (CNE) is independent and efficient, the market is 100% open, and the transmission system has been ownership unbundled idem est the most effective way to ensure third party access.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to improve the conditions for developing the cross border trade of electricity. This objective is being pursued in two ways. Firstly, through the creation of a real, integrated and competitive single Community market: the recent adoption by the Parliament and the Council of a new energy market package is a milestone in this respect. Secondly, by supporting the development of new infrastructure for the transport of electricity, namely within the Trans-European Network-program framework. The capacity of electricity interconnection in Spain remains far below the objective of 10% of domestic consumption that has been identified by the European Council at Barcelona on 15-16 March 2002 as a minimum desirable level. The development of new lines with neighbouring countries must be one of the highest priorities for Spain, as for many other Member States in the coming months and years. A new Communication, considering further measures to accelerate this, will be adopted by the Commission by the end of this year.</p>
<p>In addition, it must be remembered that, in the context of a merger case last year<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission obtained a commitment from the French Transmission System Operator to increase the commercial capacity of the interconnection lines with Spain.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The White Paper on Administrative Reform<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states: «The Commission adheres to the principle of open government». In the White Paper the Commission committed itself to a more transparent dialogue with civil society organisations. These principles were confirmed in the Commission’s White Paper on European Governance<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As a practical follow-up to these commitments, the Commission adopted last year the General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which lay down a general framework on how to carry out consultations in an open and transparent manner. Furthermore, the Commission published on the Internet a list of formal and structured consultative groups in which civil society organisations participate. The list was published in a new section 'consultative bodies' of the CONECCS database in June 2002. The CONECCS database also provides information on non-profit making civil society organisations operating at European level; the organisations’ list is made on a voluntary basis and it is only a source of information and not for accreditation.<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Finally, on the Your-Voice-In-Europe portal<a href="#defann_51_5" name="refann_51_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, which is the Commission’s single access point for consultation, everybody can see and participate in the open public consultations that the Commission has launched, and see contributions received.</p>
<p>By these commitments the Commission adheres to open and transparent dialogue with all external parties without entering into any registration or accreditation system with lobbyists. The Commission has always wanted to be open and guarantee equal access to all external parties. This principle was stated for the first time in 1992 in a Communication 'An open and structured dialogue between the Commission and special interest groups' in which the Commission also encouraged special interest groups (both profit-making and non profit-making) to draw up voluntarily codes of conduct which should include the minimum requirements as listed in the Communication<a href="#defann_51_6" name="refann_51_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
