This is not the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg. I deeply regret that the French Government has not appealed to the Court of Justice against the European Parliament decision, but I have no doubt that this decision will be overturned sooner or later. I imagine it refrained from taking action purely because such action was not timely under the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1997 ruling, which re-established the annual timetable after an attempt by the European Parliament to withdraw one of the monthly sittings, was perfectly clear. The European Parliament has no sovereign right to determine its timetable. It must respect the Treaty, and the Protocol appended to the Treaty states quite clearly that the twelve monthly part-sessions are to be held in Strasbourg. The Advocate-General at the time clearly stipulated "the 12 periods of monthly plenary sessions". This phrase means that we must adhere to existing practice, which must not be changed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the evening, we were unable to explain to them why this Parliament voted with only 170 Members in attendance. If, as a Parliament, we want to be taken seriously by the public, we will need to be present. Again, this morning, only a handful of people are attending. That is no reflection upon those present. Yesterday afternoon, too, only a handful of Members attended. I do not blame those present but rather those absent. At this rate, we will soon be unable to meet on a Thursday afternoon if so few people take part in the votes. I believe we need to do a bit of soul-searching here, and find out how we can ensure that at least a sufficient number attend when we meet on a Thursday afternoon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part, and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile, substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and, most importantly, to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource: first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource, a cultural resource and, lastly, that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the factors that motivated the entire Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and I to develop this resolution and enabled us to approve the result unanimously. I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions, including those made at the amendments stage, and also the committee's experts, for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union took the problem on board in 1999, the year in which the United Nations proclaimed the International Year of Older Persons. We have now reached the stage of a Commission communication and are here today to vote upon a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This stage is extremely important. We feel that a policy which actively tackles the issue of ageing population, which regards the elderly not as people who are about to die but as people who want and intend to remain alive – alive in their affections, alive in their professional capacities, alive in the will to communicate at all levels not just their feelings but also their professionalism and their experience – is the best way to create and develop new policies, in particular to encourage social cohesion and intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there are complex issues to deal with: the issue of security, the issue of pensions and also the issue of care of the elderly which we have attempted to tackle, which I have attempted to deal with in this resolution as calmly and effectively as possible. We are all aware that families often have to bear the burden of caring for an elderly person and that this burden often falls upon women who have to bear it alone, moreover without any recognition from the social or employment policies of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must therefore make greater efforts: they must unite and tackle this issue together. Above all, they must ensure that the future of the third and fourth ages is guaranteed. The future may consist of a single day, minute or second, but it must be a day, minute, or second which is lived in the knowledge that the life before an elderly person is a whole life, not half a life. An elderly person is a worker who has ceased to work, the elderly are men and women who have reached the point where they are navigating their way through the final stage of their lives and who must be able to do so with the necessary serenity and with the recognition from all of us but, most importantly, the recognition from the world of politics and authorities that they are people. This must not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the central theme of the resolution, which tackles different aspects of the issue ranging from leisure time to employment. In effect, when we talk of attitude, of learning and therefore of the willingness to be retrained and benefit from life-long training, we must ensure that this is a reality for the elderly as well, for older workers are often excluded from new working procedures and new technologies by technological progress. We therefore need extensive training to be available, non-discrimination in the workplace and non-discrimination during the time after retirement as well, when these workers, these people can enjoy the new wealth and new opportunities provided by all the time now available to them and live more serene lives.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are moving in this direction and, in particular, why we are considering the older and very old people who, sadly, are liable to be affected by physical problems. Indeed, as we are aware, health does not last forever. The Member States must implement different policies to support these people, tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses, especially for those invalids whose families are, in effect, unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified, independent, self-sufficient lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of strategy calls for well-coordinated objectives and is based on intergenerational solidarity, respect and recognition of the different roles which citizens play. The problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time, as the European Union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress, the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">These challenges are common to all European societies, albeit to some more than others; this applies in particular to my own country, Greece, which has the highest proportion of poor pensioners: around 31% according to Eurostat. We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures, such as lifelong learning, which ensure that they have an active lifestyle.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group has worked closely with the rapporteur, Mrs Sbarbati, and we are grateful to her for that. The report contains numerous common positions. We felt that it was particularly important to study the ageing phenomenon within various categories of older persons, because we realised that the elderly in towns face different problems from the elderly in island or rural areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly supported the involvement of the elderly in various forms of voluntary work, without overlooking the need for social security in these areas, and we believe that the European institutions and the Member States should not miss the opportunity of conducting a broad information and awareness-raising campaign directed both at the government agencies responsible for applying social policy and society as a whole, because the citizens themselves must realise that a society needs intergenerational solidarity. Supporting the European Commission's initiative and enriching it through dialogue with Parliament will, I think, send a message to the people of Europe that the European Union is in a position to forecast change and crisis and to create a society of participation, cohesion and solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree largely with her ideas and we are satisfied with the result of the work of the committee. It is set against the background of the ‘International Year of Older Persons’, as proclaimed by the UN, and it is also very important that attention has been focused in various places on how the situation of the elderly will develop in the future, for example, in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is of primary importance that the elderly are seen as independent people and that they are supported as far as is possible in their independent active lives. All the countries of the European Union have the same problems and the same prospects. For us, the question is how we can keep elderly people in the job market and what that requires of the labour market in general. On the other hand, we see that, while the population is ageing and ageing in better health than ever before, there is a growing desire generally to stop work earlier. This means, then, that we have to take account of how the job market works for different people. How do we support older people so that they can remain in the job market for longer? How do we organise life-long learning in such a way that older people also acquire the new information, new skills and, furthermore, motivation they need to remain in active employment? In other words, there are complex factors involved that have to be considered when dealing with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Very specifically, I would like to express a few views on ageing women. Everything that now concerns women in the labour market will obviously be visible in the future when they are getting older, for example in pension plans. As piecework, for example, is on the increase at present, this will be reflected in the fact that pension cover will decline in value. Although we have eventually reached a position where we have the same pay for the same work, we must remember that women need special treatment when it comes to social security as they have a different work history, and this must be taken into account as it will have implications later on, for example for their future pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a most important topic, especially with a growing ageing population in Europe. The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard. One should emphasise that unity, not only between nations and regions but also between people, is an area in which the European Union has a very proud record, and this report emphasises that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier. I am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers: this is an initiative that is welcome. Promoting life-long learning – a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker – is a matter I also support. With new technology and distance-learning possibilities open to older people, real, new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this.</p>
<p class="contents">On social protection policies: in its work programme for 1999, the Commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement, to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">On policies against discrimination and social exclusion: the social action programme sets out the Commission's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new Community action programmes based on Articles 13, 129 and 139, as modified in Amsterdam, and that is something we all welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report. Perhaps – and I say this as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – sport and exercise should have been given more emphasis to keep ageing people fit and healthy – but that is something I am sure the rapporteur is well aware of.</p>

Those were the exception to the rule, for the large majority of people died at a relatively young age due to adverse conditions. Nowadays, an increasing number of people live longer thanks to better health care, provision of information, care, housing and pension schemes. Some researchers anticipate that people could actually live up to 120 years, but they invariably die earlier because a vital part of their body ceases to function. Provided we organise our care and social security well, we can allow an increasing number of people to reach the maximum age. Collective expenditure on public services prolongs our lives. Over the past decade in Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate. The shortage of employees in a growing economy puts pressure on older people to stay in their jobs for longer. In fact, this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it. That is a development in the wrong direction. Needless to say, people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things, but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours. These people are far more useful as a bonding agent in society who help others function more efficiently. It is precisely in voluntary work that they can pass on their life experience and promote cooperation in their own living environments. By forcing them to continue in paid work, they cannot fulfil those useful tasks, and it is likely that their life expectancy will be reduced if we impose obligations such as these on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a feeling that the aspects which I have mentioned, namely the importance of collective care and the importance of timely retirement, are considered to be of slightly less importance by the rapporteur and that, moreover, she is too optimistic about the possibility of the elderly thriving without our creating the social conditions to match. One way in which we could strengthen their position would be to adopt Amendment No 4, tabled by my colleague, Mr Alavanos, which aims to better adapt housing and transport to the needs of the elderly. I hope that the House will adopt this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But these recommendations continue to miss the mark. She urges Community action, whether that is appropriate or not. In this area of policy, European institutions hardly have any authority. It is mainly the Member States' governments at federal, provincial and local level which can put many of these recommendations to good use. We should not burden the European Commission with atypical work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few decades, an ageing and greying population will emerge, caused by a falling birth rate and an increase in life expectancy. As a consequence, expenditure on health care and pensions will soar dramatically. The OESO has been carrying out research into this area for some years now and has published reports on this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Research in the Netherlands has shown that, up to the age of 50, the average cost of health care is approximately EUR 1 000 per person per year. This amount increases to EUR 4 000 for 75 year-olds and to around EUR 25 000 per year for 95 year-olds. To buck this trend will take time. After all, by excessively promoting the trend towards individualism, we have created a situation for ourselves where the elderly rely on care institutions to a far greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the cost of pensions in a number of Member States has grown out of all proportion. In its monthly report for July 2000, the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings. In some EMU countries, the cost amounts to twice the GDP. This is in addition to the government debt, which is already very high.</p>
<p class="contents">To my great surprise, the report does not contain any specific recommendations on this matter. Many Member States will need to go on a serious economy drive and prioritise the setting up of funds in order to keep the cost of pensions affordable and to keep the rise in gross average earnings within limits. If this is not done, we will have no choice other than to reduce pension payments. Raising the pensionable age, as proposed by the European Commission, will certainly not prove sufficient as a measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the rapporteur’s view that every elderly person deserves respect and appreciation. Unfortunately, we are up against it on virtually every score. A person only counts for as long as they are young, progressive and fashionable. It is exactly the life experiences and wisdom of the elderly which we need in our here-today-gone-tomorrow society. We need to change our pattern of thought right across the board. People need each other’s care and attention; they rely on each other. The basis for this outlook on life is the family, in which each human being grows up. What is bizarre is that, these days, the family is generally no longer considered to be the nucleus of society and appreciated for what it is. Here, too, individualism has taken its toll.</p>
<p class="contents">Add to this the undervaluing of nurturing and caring responsibilities, which feeds the absurd thought that housewives are less productive. Their valuable contribution to our society is hugely neglected in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The plea to combat age discrimination at the workplace has my support although, once again, I wonder if an EU Directive is necessary. In my opinion, it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although the elderly can count on my sympathy and appreciation, I will vote against this report for the reasons cited above. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore congratulate her, as do all the pensioners and elderly people to whom I owe seat no 274 in this Chamber!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to paragraph 18 of the report, which calls upon "the Member States to undertake the task of caring for older people who are in hospital and unable to look after themselves, or to reimburse the expenses of doing so to families who help them". This amendment was tabled by myself, Carlo Fatuzzo, and accepted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I would stress the importance of this paragraph. In many of our Member States – in Italy, certainly, and, I am sure, in the United Kingdom, Greece and other States – we work extremely hard: we work from morning to night, getting up at six o'clock in the morning and returning home, tired, worn out, at eight or nine o'clock at night. The years go by: our work causes us to fall ill, we pay pension contributions and national insurance contributions; we pay rates and taxes. It is a common occurrence, in the latter years of life, for a worker to become very seriously ill, often a total invalid, needing assistance from everybody. And the State provides no financial assistance at all, not even for those who have no property and no income. And the worker, who has given everything to society, has to sell his house to pay for healthcare, to use up all his money and to see his family reduced to scrimping and saving, at the very moment when one would expect the State and other people to be supportive, during the last years of one's life, when everything looks black and the only ray of light is the help of one's neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore give hope to the elderly citizens throughout Europe by voting for this report, including paragraph 18.</p>

The rapporteur, who has examined the subject with a great deal of sensitivity, points out that we need to combat negative stereotypes and consolidate equality between the generations as a basis for a European social model. Thanks to her proposals for an active old age, society is enriched by a whole generation.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging the elderly to take up roles which they can fulfil on a voluntary basis will help overcome the objections of trades union, which view any extension of working life with suspicion. At the same time, the report encourages us to revise other policies designed solely for younger generations and aims to awaken the interest of other age groups by redefining the participation of all ages in local economic and social life and redistributing income between them.</p>
<p class="contents">This ambitious objective calls for a radical change in practices and the active involvement of the social partners. However, because the elderly do not form a homogenous group, as the communication rightly points out, it is mainly up to the social partners to put forward a system of classification of elderly people which meets modern requirements. It quite rightly combines this policy with the policy for the viability of pension systems. The redistribution of resources implied in the policy to modernise pension systems, an explosive problem, represents a further aim of the new policy for all ages. The proposal to make pension systems dependent upon demographic change in order to create a self-sustaining system is linked to a high level of employment among the elderly. However, extensive early retirement and various graduated terms of retirement presuppose a massive revision of these policies because not all of them are socially inspired.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close with a word on medical care. A quality of life policy depends directly, especially in the case of the elderly, on the quality of medical care. The communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the markets are only interested in young people and their purchasing power, it falls to politicians to attend to the issue of older people. In many EU countries it is being discussed whether existing pension rights and benefits can be safeguarded in the future. In many countries pensions have been promised although there are not the corresponding funds to pay them. When the single currency is introduced in the form of the euro and monetary policy is the same in all countries, those countries will be subjected to an enormous amount of pressure to cut pensions. Promises regarding pensions must be kept, but pensions must be secured with those countries’ own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU’s common monetary policy. It is a guaranteed income that will give older and elderly aged people the greatest sense of security. Employment is also one of the basic human rights, and Mrs Sbarbati’s report has rightly brought attention to age-based discrimination and ageism in working life. It is politicians who must safeguard the notion of equality in employment: the markets cannot. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Discrimination does exist. There are countries in the European Union whose national health services will no longer pay for operations on people above a certain age, as if to say what use is this operation to this old person now? In many cases rehabilitation following illness is no longer available to old people under the national systems. This is discrimination on the grounds of age.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one Member State whose parliament has discussed whether voting rights should not be removed from the over seventies. The debate is over now, but this was discussed. In all of the Member States there are laws which quite simply forbid people above a certain age from working. This is discrimination on the grounds of age. Please do not come to me with the popular cry: "But surely, then, we are taking away jobs from young people". That reminds me of the debate in the sixties about keeping us women out of the labour market. Then, people also said that women must not work so that the men could. This was the line of argument taken by the unions for a long time. And they are still banging the wrong drum today.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we not please finally put a stop to this! Almost all of the speakers have mentioned the "ageing workforce". Mr Blokland has even spoken of ageing and greying. One colleague has said that it is not we who are living for too long, it is not our society which is too old, but that centuries ago people had to die much earlier than the good Lord had preordained in our genes. 110 or 120 years is quite right! Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time, for our human life span has doubled. We have been given a second life. 150 years ago, our average life expectancy was 40 years; today it is 80 years. A girl born today is likely to live for 100 years or more. We should not call this ageing or even “greying”. Stop using these words, because that really is discrimination. The future of all of you is old age. I would advise you to make provisions for your future!</p>

<p class="contents">That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned, in the first analysis. My own personal opinion, and that of an increasingly large number of people, is that this may be an advantage if we can manage to do what is necessary in order to ensure that every citizen, regardless of age, remains a full citizen and that experience becomes once again a key value in a society which, in recent years, has favoured what is speedy, ephemeral and fashionable over what has lasted, time served and wealth of experience, not to mention what is human.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I can only be delighted, today, at the issue of this communication and this report aimed at building a Europe for all ages and promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges, particularly the economic ones, are well known. I shall not harp on that subject. To face up to these challenges and transform these very real problems into real assets, I believe we need great determination and great moral, philosophical and political commitment. We also need considerable financial resources. This last point, of course, runs counter to the fashionable individualist ideology which advocates less public expenditure and less taxation on the working population. This is a miscalculation, considering the current and future demographic situation, and also considering the fact that today’s working population will be tomorrow’s non-working population, in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as I am concerned, and this is no doubt the most important aspect, investing in life is, in any case, a good economic investment, and adding life to the extra years is an approach which provides a foundation for human dignity. This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress.</p>

<p class="contents">Now then, it is not up to the workers to work for longer so that their contributions might compensate for the miserliness of the bosses who wish to stop the employer’s share of old-age pension contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are absolutely opposed to anything that postpones retirement age, as we particularly have in mind the factory workers, many of whom are worn out well before the legal retirement age, even in countries where this age is relatively low.</p>

As a member of the Friday Club – which admittedly is not an official group but in practice does exist – I am one of the hosts of the Members present today, as you are, and I hope that we will also manage this next year. We really will have to find the ways and means to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who is not yet a senior citizen, the following struck me about the report on a Europe for all ages, including the elderly: neither of my committees – the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities – lament the fact that our society is ageing; they welcome it. Mrs Flemming has rightly pointed out that it is positive that people are able to live for longer and at the same time stay healthy. What is negative is that many of them are sidelined, and it is also negative that many of them are forced to feel marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of age was, of course, confirmed in my report on Article 13, which I was able to present to the House in October. Older workers are prevented from going on to further education and training courses; they are also prevented from acquiring new technical skills even though they would be capable of doing so. Their ability to learn and even their ability to innovate are denied. They are harassed at work, with the result that, in the end, they give in and allegedly retire from their job voluntarily. Measures need to be taken to combat acts of discrimination. These must be developed through model projects which, in turn, need to be supported by Community initiatives such as EQUAL.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sbarbati is right to call on the Commission to support the proposal to limit compulsory early retirement. I can amplify what she said with some comments on the German experience. The rules on early retirement, which were initially well intentioned on the part of politicians, were seriously abused by some companies. They accepted payments – the whole of society was therefore involved – and older workers retired, but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed. If we talk about finance, anyone who retires from working life is entitled to a pension and not to be discriminated against with people saying, "You are getting a pittance". However different the national pensions systems are in Europe, they should all be earnings- and performance-related.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that there will be information campaigns in the Member States encouraging older people to get involved in society, in cultural and social activities, in community centres, in caring for children and the elderly, in associations and clubs. We need these people and not only the young, dynamic and successful people! Another part of an effective strategy is to foster an intergenerational dialogue. I am thinking of encounters in seminars and evaluation of best practices, where older people can pass on their knowledge and experience to younger people in the company. Many people are younger at 70 than others are at 17, who only want to go with the flow and not upset anyone or attract attention. Anyone who is satisfied with the average will never embark on the adventure of a committed life. The countless active elderly people should motivate us all to fight for a society in which the phrase intergenerational solidarity is not just empty words!</p>

<p class="contents">Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs worked very hard to table its very long motion for a resolution. At my advanced age I am, of course, pleased that it says in the motion that the vast experience and skills of older people need to be used; this means that even when people are over 75 they should not be consigned to the scrap heap.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of efforts to combat discrimination on the basis of Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty, there is a campaign for measures to be introduced to ensure that older people are no longer excluded from the workplace, which is actually saying that the obligatory age limit and also compulsory early retirement are discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission is then even called upon to draft a proposal for a directive which should make it possible to combat discrimination specifically on the grounds of age. Obviously we need to be careful that we do not contradict ourselves in the many long resolutions which we adopt here. You see, on the one hand, we are saying that we wish to use obligatory age limits to get rid of the elderly so as to free up jobs for young people, but, in other areas, we are almost demanding the abolition of obligatory age limits. I do not necessarily think that all women should go out to work either, because we are after all calling for the labour force penetration rate of women to be increased through changes in family and tax policy. I do not believe that all women – or all men – should have to go out to work if they decide to have a career break or to stop working in order to devote themselves to their family. Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad, however – and Mrs Flemming referred to this case of discrimination – that women are no longer discriminated against in this way now. When I started working for the unions I was told that I would be dismissed if I were to get married. As a result I am unfortunately still single today!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to do something for older working women, then the pension companies in the Member States should be called upon to rectify the disastrous consequences of the wage discrimination which women were exposed to until 1975 by virtue of the fact that they were paid – entirely legally – only 80 or 90% of men's wages. They should be called upon to eradicate this discrimination, which has a knock-on effect on the pension, by using 100% of a man's salary at the time as a basis for calculating the pension.</p>
<p class="contents">This really would be a good thing, and in so doing the consequences of such dreadful discrimination would be removed. I have one final point: I should like to distance myself from paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution. Surely we cannot call upon the Member States to undertake the task of caring for people in nursing homes. I believe that it is for the Member States to decide – in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity – how to resolve this problem, whether it be through a nursing insurance scheme or in other ways. I will, of course, be voting in favour of the report, but I thought it important to clarify these points.</p>

This is a serious, thorough study of the problems faced by the elderly, but it is also a bold, innovative report in terms of the proposals it puts forward to promote the active participation of the elderly in working, social and cultural life.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing of the population is, today, an indisputable fact which places considerable pressure on the social security systems of some Member States. Enabling our citizens to age in an active and healthy way is one of the great challenges of our times and requires Community policies to match national social security and public health systems. We cannot simply limit the issue of intergenerational solidarity to the financial sphere. We must foster a global vision of support for the elderly and for their families, particularly for women who look after elderly people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our current social model makes a cult of youth. This is a deeply ingrained idea, which thoroughly pervades all areas of social life and which must be combated through the effective practice of intergenerational solidarity. Given the significant increase in life expectancy as a result of the enormous medical progress that we have seen, particular attention must be paid to demographic developments in the population. We must produce a coordinated strategy for employment in conjunction with measures to counter discrimination on the grounds of age and modernise pensions and health schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we develop concrete policies and specific programmes for the various categories of elderly people. These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency. Because we cannot treat unequal situations equally, Member States will have to provide a response to the situation of elderly people who are completely bereft of savings and who are completely dependent on the help and care of relatives or others, and they will also have to ensure that a form of insurance is created that guarantees the elderly the right to see out their days with dignity and serenity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is much of the reason why I am here – an MEP, a Scotsman, a European. In the early 1930s he spent much time in Germany. He had good German friends. He witnessed and worried about the rise of Nazism. While I was very small he was away for long periods, parachuted into southern Serbia to support the brave fight of the royalist Serbs against Nazism. Next he parachuted into the Hautes-Alpes of France to fight with the Maquis and prepare that part of Europe for liberation. I have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in Mont-Dauphin and Briançon. Immediately after the war he went back to Germany to help restore agriculture and food supplies in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. My brother and I joined him there. We played in the rubble of Hamburg, we made good German friends in our turn.</p>
<p class="contents">On my first day in this Parliament, in 1979, one of our then German colleagues approached me. "Are you Purvis?" "Yes." "I remember rocking you on my knee in your kilt in Hamburg in 1946. We so respected your father," he said. "He could have taken advantage of us but he didn't. He did all he could fairly to share out scarce resources and restore our country."</p>
<p class="contents">Father is in his 90s. I am in my 60s, my children in their 30s, my grandchildren between 0 and 5 – four generations of a Scottish and a European family.

I am particularly pleased because it shows that the Commission and the European Parliament are to a large extent in agreement and have developed a common understanding of the challenges of ageing. The debate has shown that there is broad agreement on the appropriate political response to this in the fields of employment, social security, health and social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly facing tremendous challenges. Only a sustained and joint effort can help us to meet them. I think that it is important to preserve a high degree of consensus so that we succeed in adapting to the process of ageing in our society in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to stress the significance of this communication. It is true that the communication contains few specific proposals for measures and initiatives. However, it does offer an innovative diagnosis of the greatest challenges of ageing, out of which emerges an extremely important compilation of suitable political responses, responses to issues relating to employment, social security, health and social integration. Ensuing Commission proposals have adhered rigidly to this roughly sketched out agenda. It will undoubtedly also provide further information about political trends in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns about closing the age gap in Europe's performance balance sheet have been reflected very strongly in the employment process, from the guidelines to the recommendations to the NLP and peer review procedures. They were also plain to see in the plans for the Community initiative EQUAL and in the allocation of ESF funds from 2001 to 2006. What is more, age-related issues are amongst the most important objectives setting the agenda in the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection. In the most recent communications on pensions, the central idea has been "mobilising society's full potential", because raising the employment rate of older people who are fit to work is crucial to providing sustainable pensions in an ageing society. Initiatives in areas such as equal opportunities, equal treatment and social integration are similarly outward signs of aspects of an active ageing scenario. At this stage, I should like to emphasise that the directive on equal treatment in the workplace, which was adopted on 12 October 2000, bans discrimination on the grounds of age.</p>
<p class="contents">Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health- and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing. Finally, part of the fifth framework programme for research provides for investigations into issues associated with old age, including the effects on health of an active lifestyle in old age. It is therefore clear that the political paradigm of active ageing is reflected in many important initiatives and we can safely assume that it will inspire a raft of further initiatives in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will, in conclusion, respond to a number of points where Parliament has expressed concern about the effects of the measures proposed by the Commission. A constantly recurring concern in your report was whether an emphasis on political measures promoting active and healthy ageing did not necessarily mean poorer conditions and fewer rights for people in need of care, for the very old and for those unfit for work. I should like to give you explicit assurance that this is certainly not the Commission's intention. Quite the opposite: in the communication, the Commission has laid great stress on the assertion that political measures should address the differences between people. Early retirement must remain an option for those who are no longer fit to work. Not everyone can or should retire voluntarily from working life. There must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions. Furthermore, in our view, over-emphasising active political measures has precisely the opposite effect. In fact it is a precondition for our ability to find sufficient resources for those in need of care, so that the wealthy amongst us are willing and able to pay higher contributions and become more independent in old age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem is that, insofar as we as the European Union are concerned, we cannot talk about development because we do not have genuine population development: the birth-rate is extremely low while the proportion of elderly people is increasing.

This approach is a welcome one, and is similar to that already employed to promote agricultural products in third countries. The proposal concerns both product information and production methods. It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities. The idea is to emphasise areas where a European approach is appropriate such as the provision of information on the intrinsic characteristics of products, including quality, nutritional aspects, organic production, etc. This should enable complementary measures to be taken, inevitably producing synergies.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has certain immediate advantages: a single system providing information and promotion for all agricultural products and production methods; measures enabling the rationalisation of proper consumer information on foodstuff products; the decentralisation and general use of specifications for the sectors concerned. However, whilst the proposal as a whole appears relevant and well structured, I consider that it may be appropriate to clarify and improve certain aspects in order to enable the potential benefits to be fully exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Environment did as much, and the text has been enhanced by the proposed amendments which have been adopted. Let me list some of these. We thought it important to include production methods in this information campaign as they are crucial to product quality. I also think it essential to provide for a greater financial contribution by the Community in the event of certain specific circumstances which would justify this, for example, a serious market crisis or marked Community interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the procedures to be followed in applying this regulation, calling on the various existing competent management committees does not seem to me to be the most appropriate approach, given the horizontal nature of this initiative. The establishment of an ad hoc management committee has been proposed, which would have competence for the promotion of agricultural products. Lists and guidelines should be drawn up more regularly. A period of two years has been suggested in order to ensure that the system retains a certain flexibility, the same interval as that proposed for the Commission to issue a report to the Council and to Parliament, assessing the implementation of the proposal and examining, among other things, the utilisation of appropriations and possible budgetary requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, given that it is for the trade bodies to take the initiative with regard to the measures to be proposed, the latter should not be confronted with guidelines that are too inflexible and would them in a straitjacket rather than providing them with a framework. The new arrangements should therefore not become effective until 2002. It would therefore be appropriate to set as the date of entry into force of the regulation the date of adoption of the implementing regulation, so as not to lose the appropriations available in 2001. Finally, a reference to the possibility of actions to promote products of the most remote regions and their logo should be explicitly reinserted into the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus amended, the proposal would deserve our support. A coherent product promotion policy is one of the tools making it possible to put European farm models into practice effectively. It is also a major tool for communication with consumers who, these days, no longer know what food they can trust.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our chairman today reminded us that he was chairing the last sitting of this millennium. Let me draw your attention to the fact that the vote on this report will also be the last one this year. Perhaps this fact will instil a spirit of unanimity in us, which would, doubtless, knowing the great-heartedness of the Commission, lead it to accept all our amendments. Thanks you, ladies and gentlemen, and may I wish everyone in the Chamber today a very happy festive period.</p>

It is still necessary to promote agricultural products, particularly as the price of agricultural products has fallen, and this price reduction has certainly not been fully offset.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Budgets differs from that of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on a number of scores. First of all, the Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that agricultural products not intended for consumption should be promoted as well as those intended for consumption. All agricultural products will need to be promoted. Unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has rejected this proposal. My group has re-submitted it under Amendment No 27, and I would like to recommend it to you warmly.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the standard promotion activities, we believe that a number of aspects will need to be highlighted. Firstly, it should be pointed out how good agricultural products, such as fruit, milk etc. are for you. Another aspect to be highlighted is the animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly production methods used in Europe. How can we explain to European farmers that they are to be ever more restricted in their activities and that they should employ animal-friendly production methods, while at the same time our borders remain open to products from farmers who do not need to use these methods? We need to emphasise the European aspects to the general public. The Committee on Budgets already holds the view that if, in the context of the WTO negotiations in 2003 or later, a number of export refunds and other export amounts are reduced, the European Commission should ensure that a portion of those refunds and amounts are ploughed back into further promotion activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the WTO negotiations we will come under strong pressure to reduce export refunds, and cuts in this sector will be very likely. That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here, and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures. This sector is, of course, included in the "green box", and it would, of course, make it possible for us to present European products on the world market in an entirely new and much more intensive way. I see great opportunities for quality European products here.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately this is also support for rural areas, on which, after all, we spend 10% more today, a sign that these regional economies should also be receiving more support, so that, on the one hand, the theory "think global, act local" can very well be asserted but, on the other, the world market is not disregarded either. It is precisely in the food sector – but also in the agricultural non-food products sector – that we have good opportunities in the future here, and we should therefore make the most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, then, that, in the future, the existing 12 categories of products will not be the only ones to be the subjects of promotional campaigns but that the arrangements will be extended to all agricultural products. So, Mrs Lulling, there will be opportunities here in the future not only for grape juice but also for wine. We should also set ourselves a target. We ought, in fact, to ensure that food production in Europe has an aim, and this actually follows on very well from the preceding debate. You see, we want to use our food to keep people healthy into old age. We want to stay healthy, and food is the overall basis for healthy living. That is why I am also pleased that, this week in the European Parliament, we have set up a working group on biotechnology. We want to address health-related issues in detail. We also believe that particular account ought to be taken here of organic farming and production and that, of course, Europe will be able to make considerable progress on the international scene with its brands and designations of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">A trend which has become increasingly pronounced recently is e-commerce. I believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products. It is expected that, by the year 2003, 80% of the European population will in all likelihood be connected to the Internet. Obviously, this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant, and new opportunities are emerging which, at the end of the day, need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important area is, of course, further education and training. I believe that where marketing, sales and training programmes are concerned, life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more, because it is precisely the new technologies – handling product promotion using modern logistics – which will open up entirely new possibilities. Cooperation between industry, agriculture, trade and consumers is therefore of paramount importance here, and I would be glad if we were able to achieve new standards of cooperation in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Dary, bravo, you have mastered the art of communication, and this is precisely the reason why you were appointed to draw up the report before us right now.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more serious note, I should like to emphasise the value of this proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market. The rapporteur presented the main points just now. I should just like to add, at this time when BSE is highlighting a number of abuses in forms of agriculture which place the emphasis on high productivity, that it is especially appropriate to raise the profile, within the internal market, of the specific qualities of agricultural products by including, as the rapporteur suggests, indications of production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">For, while European agriculture may reasonably expect to be a force to be reckoned with on international markets, the fact nonetheless remains that its future is still linked to a greater extent to penetration of its own internal market, which comprises 370 million consumers today and will probably number almost 500 million tomorrow. From this point of view, campaigns for information provision and promotion, cofinanced by the European Union and the Member States, are essential both to help restore the somewhat tarnished image of agriculture in the eyes of consumers and, moreover, to bring about recognition of the excellent quality of the very great majority of our agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors. There must be periodic campaigns targeted at specific populations or consumers in general in order to highlight aspects relating to, for instance, food safety, traceability, nutritional quality, the specific characteristics of production methods, or indeed the efforts made to promote animal welfare. And while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers, we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves, who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dary, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has complied with your various recommendations. We now hope that Parliament will fall in line with them across the board, and I, of course, urge my own group to give you its complete support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his good report. I should not like to discuss the details of the report, however, because it is fine as it stands. After all, colleagues have talked about it. I should just like to express a few simple truths at the end of the year. Firstly, this is about the fact that PR measures are to be implemented to promote the European model of agriculture, as you said. I should like to make it clear in this connection that within this European model of agriculture we still do not have codecision; neither for this report nor for bananas. We write our report, we do our work, and if the Council does not like it then it does what it wants. Progress on this point was not forthcoming in Nice either.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as you know, I remarked rather sarcastically that we had come a step further; the opposite is, of course, the case. I do not think that we should relax our efforts to move towards codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few more truths to tell: if we are talking about PR, but have to tackle BSE, then perhaps it would be a good idea to grasp the fact that cows belong in fields. It is as simple as that. If they had stayed in the fields then we would not have had BSE.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Or what about when people say that we have a shortage of protein? If Parliament's proposals to allow legumes and clover to be grown on set-aside land and be used for animal feed had been implemented – they have been passed by a majority three times here, but that shows yet again how powerless Parliament is – then we would have had more basic rations and more protein feed. Then, you see, the cows would have stayed in the fields and we would not have had to use meat meal as animal feed. A simple truth, if people are now saying that we could not guarantee calf feed because there was no milk replacer feed, is that calves drink milk. If we want something for the machines than surely we can powder whole milk. The practice of mixing a fat into calf feed which comes from meat meal production – which in any case is highly dubious given the risk of BSE transmission – creates in my opinion a centre of infection for young animals. Why do we not say in this case that we will put butter into the calves' feed? After all, we have enough of it. Here, too, the question of the European agricultural model arises.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point concerns aid. There are farms of the same size, not one small and one large but of the same size, where one receives DEM 15 000 per worker and the other receives DEM 150 000 per worker. This means that the second farmer receives more than it costs him to pay his employees. If I received as much as that per worker on my 50-hectare farm, then I would take on five more people. I have to pay the five people whom I employ out of the profits from what I produce and not out of the money from Brussels. We need to agree on social criteria here which guarantee reasonably equal treatment if we are going to assume that agriculture also wants to offer jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, you are familiar with the debate surrounding the new Member States and the question of whether they will receive the compensatory payments or not. If they receive the compensatory payments in the same way as we do here then we will have the same problem, namely that we will not promote job creation but that, basically, we will set in motion a job destruction machine because people want to be able to use the premiums which they draw from Brussels in a lucrative way.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point relates to exports and intervention. Animals are still being transported because we subsidise live exports of calves. If we were to abolish this practice then we would no longer need to talk about these consignments of animals or the pictures with which we are familiar from the media. These are all ways in which we present ourselves to the world, and we come across in a negative, not a positive light.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there are alternatives is something which Mr Garot showed in his report when, for once, with pigs, we tried to develop a market organisation which was actually designed to benefit farming and safeguard farming structures. This does not stand a chance, though. The only ray of hope is the regulation on organic farming and, in Germany, recently, there has been much talk of a superior culture. If we take organic farming as the superior culture of agricultural policy, then I think that we ought to adopt further measures which are basically quite straightforward. This would also make it possible for us to use PR measures to inform the public – including the public outside Europe – about our good food production system and to convince them of its worth.</p>

<p class="contents">I fear too that I am going to disappoint the rapporteur, for there is no unanimous backing for this report. It is about how the system of sales promotion measures is to be changed. I think it is wrong in principle to have such measures in the European Union. It cannot reasonably be the taxpayers’ and the European Union’s business to finance advertising campaigns to encourage people, for example, to buy tulips or eat more apples. This is properly a matter for producers, retailers and trade associations, not the European Union. I think we ought now to have taken the opportunity to phase out the system rather than change and consolidate it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out that there are serious faults in this aspect of agricultural policy. At present, so much support is being given to production that an enormous volume of certain articles is being produced, for which there is no market. There are no purchasers. If agricultural products are not quite simply to be destroyed, this leads to export subsidies having to be introduced, which destroy the agricultural market in other countries, or advertising campaigns financed by taxpayers. The system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the EU’s agricultural policy. I believe it is the fault in the system that ought to be tackled. No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand, and the latter must not be advertised. There are too many elements of the planned economy in this system. I shall therefore be voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCartin (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, if I read it right I am the last speaker in the debate from the floor of the House. As a child, my father was quite fond of talking himself. He used to accuse me of wanting to have the last word. It appears that I am having the last word here not only in this debate but in the millennium from the floor of this House, so he would be quite proud of me if he was still alive.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we have had widely divergent views expressed here. I want to congratulate the Commission on bringing forward this proposal. The rapporteur has researched this area very thoroughly and made an excellent report even if I might not agree with all of it, and he pointed out that it seems we did not do so well in the past. Spending under the last programme actually fell between 1997 and 1998. We have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the European Union to take up the money that was available. Obviously, we have some learning to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we should spend money on this subject. The consumers need correct information and they need reassurance. I sincerely hope that it is not anyone's ideological view of what is safe and right that will be put forward, but information with a proper scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Organic farming is fine as far as it goes. I have nothing against it. I was an organic farmer myself at one time, because everyone was an organic farmer when I started farming at 15 years of age, which is some time ago. What the consumers of Europe should understand today is that food was never so cheap as it is now. It was never so plentiful as it is now. It was never as safe as it is today in spite of some of the problems that still exist and will probably continue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point we should remember. Everyone in Europe has enough to eat for the most part. Everyone has sufficient food, so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product. The European Commission has to be extremely careful. If dairy products and beef, on which we spend an awful lot of money and indeed sheepmeat as well, although we do not have surpluses of it, are advertised with public money to compete with products which are not subsidised like pig meat and poultry meat, then obviously we are upsetting the balance of the market and doing an injustice to some of our producers. We must be extremely careful about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig points out that there are so many things we can sell abroad. That is extremely important because, as time goes by, we will not be allowed to continue our old practice of producing low-quality products and selling them highly-subsidised, unprocessed and with no value added on foreign markets. In a world where the population is growing by 80 and 90 million a year, there must be a market for European food, because no place in the world is better suited to the production of food and no farmers in the world know better how to respond to opportunities than European farmers. There must be a future there. Mr Mulder is right when he said that the common agriculture policy is designed not only for food but also for the social objective of keeping the maximum number of people in rural areas. By using modern technology and using modern science and modernising our industry, we have made food available to the poor at the right price. This was never done when we were producing organically.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if we can produce and promote food that is better for the environment and takes animal welfare into consideration, and sell that on world markets, then we will be really fulfilling the vocation for which the common agricultural policy was intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks also go to the other Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as well as to the other committees which have worked on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed measures are intended to replace the 12 sectoral promotional schemes which the Council has adopted over the years. The existing schemes, which lacked uniformity, will thus be harmonised and simplified. We are adopting the same concept of promotion here which is already applied outside the European Union. The Union is thus providing itself with a flexible promotional tool in the internal market too, which can be used across the board. This means, therefore, that the old product-based strategy is being replaced by an approach with a greater thematic emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">These promotional campaigns at European level can usefully complement Member States' measures by taking up the following themes: for example, quality, nutritional aspects, food safety, labelling, traceability, protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, organic or integrated production methods, and so on. This would considerably improve the identity of European products in the eyes of consumers, and we certainly agree that this is necessary because consumers are, as we know, becoming increasingly discerning in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This concept of thematic information provision and promotional measures complementing national and regional measures requires strong commitment on the part of the Member States, in the form of co-financing and support for administering and monitoring the measures to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Having analysed the amendments, we can distinguish three groups: firstly, amendments which the Commission can accept; secondly, amendments which are superfluous because the proposal is worded in such general terms – as befits a framework regulation – that they are actually already covered; and thirdly, a group of amendments which the Commission also rejects because they either do not fit into this proposal or would have undesired consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 10, which call for information on the production methods used for agricultural products and foods to be included in campaigns of this kind. As regards Amendment No 5, which calls for general guidelines by means of which only the essential elements of the programmes concerned are defined, the Commission is open to the possibility of including this idea in the wording of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the proposal. It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years, so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool. These are the amendments which the Commission can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the amendments which are already covered by the proposal and are therefore not accepted. These are the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31 and 32. The Commission quite understands the thinking behind these amendments, but we feel that the general nature of this draft regulation is sufficient. Moreover, some of these ideas will be taken up again in the implementing provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment briefly on the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 28. An explicit reference to regional origin or other specific information would excessively limit the scope of the regulation. Amendment No 25 must also be rejected. Regarding the issue of when the new arrangements should come into force, the Commission is, however, prepared to consider transitional arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The final group of amendments which the Commission cannot accept are amendments which are at odds with the proposal, those which could have unwelcome consequences and those in which administrative procedures are proposed which are not customary practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the amendments one by one. Amendment No 1 is legally incorrect because Article 299 of the EC Treaty can only be applied for derogations from other articles of the EC Treaty. This is not the case here. Amendments Nos 3, 16 and 17 and the second part of Amendment No 24 could give rise to misunderstandings about the aims of our promotion policy. Amendments Nos 6 and 33 cannot be accepted because, given the limited funds available, they would make the EU share of the co-financing simply too great. They would also reduce the other partners' share of the responsibility. All we can say to Amendments Nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up, and Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought, is that the Commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support. Consequently, thanks to your help and your opinion, the Community will soon be in a position to implement an important new promotional tool. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to do so now. The second point that I wanted to make is that despite the critical remarks which, as you know, I also made clearly in my speech, we are glad that this report has been adopted and that the Commission is getting this scheme off the ground. Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture. All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right. And people should do so on special occasions. But this does not in any way change what I said clearly just now, that we also need to pay attention to the small details, that we must not forget the superior culture of a European agricultural policy which is geared towards social and ecological concerns, and that we should always check measures to ensure that they are also having the desired effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to follow up on one further point. To return to set-aside, if you looked, you would be able to see that, in practice, set-aside is not caused by crop rotation, but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals. This means that the whole point of set-aside, which was originally intended in 1992 to make crop rotation more environmentally friendly, is turned completely on its head. Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice. That was my petition this morning. I wanted to point this out. Now that we are all convinced that we need to reach a turning point in agricultural policy, I hope that we will also sit down together and do our homework so as to put right these small details, something which is urgently necessary.</p>

<p class="contents">When we discussed the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine in this House, we tabled amendments in an – unfortunately unsuccessful – attempt to insert a chapter on the promotion of wine products into this organisation of the market. I now have some small consolation, because we must not, in third countries where there is a demand backed by purchasing power for high quality wine products, leave the field clear for the wine producers of some third countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States, to name but a few, who have considerable amounts to spend on promoting their products, with far fewer constraints and regulations than those we impose on our own wine growers, who are occasionally victims of unfair competition, especially with regard to registered designations, even when they are not, as in some Member States, subjected to a policy of exorbitant taxation on alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must promote the moderate consumption of wine, whose medicinal properties have been known since ancient times. In those times, the Rule of Saint Benedict required monks to drink one ‘hemina’, or about half a pint, of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is scientific proof that moderate consumption of wine is one of the best ways of preventing cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's disease and many other illnesses. Any money will therefore be well spent, and I hope that the Commission will not be so stingy with these appropriations as it has been, once again, with the appropriations for honey and for bees, when my amendments, even though they had been adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, were not adopted by the Commission, the Council or our own Committee on Budgets. I really must protest about that, as it was only 15 million. This is really peanuts, and I therefore hope that the Commission will not prove to be as stingy with its funds in this instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings. I believe that the issues which have been debated at these Friday sittings have definitely been of strategic significance for Europe. I should like to make one further request of the French Presidency: that Mr Moscovici – because he has given really extremely brief and sometimes imprecise answers to questions here – answer these questions fully and in writing for the European Parliament, because for us, good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament means that we face each other as equals and that each takes the other seriously. That is why I would also be interested to know whether the issue of Friday sittings was discussed at the Nice Summit, that is whether it was of importance or insignificance to the French Presidency.</p>

<p>In December 1997, the Luxembourg European Council established the principle that the applicant countries' respect for the Copenhagen political criteria - namely stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the respect for and protection of minorities - is a prior condition for the opening of any accession negotiations. The fact that, in December 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to open negotiations with Romania, amongst other countries, indicates that the European Union considered that, generally speaking, Romania meets these criteria.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is nothing left to do. The most recent Commission regular report, presented last November, highlights a whole series of areas in which Romania needs to make substantial progress. Some of these areas relate to the Copenhagen political criteria, and these include the issue of increased recourse to ordinances, as mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>It is true that the regular report, as such, is only the Commission’s opinion. However, the General Affairs Council held on 4 and 5 December has just adopted conclusions on the progress of the enlargement process, in which it welcomes the quality of the information transmitted by the Commission and considers that the regular reports are a necessary tool for monitoring each candidate country's preparations for accession. Clearly, therefore, the Commission will follow extremely closely the progress made by Romania in the future in the areas covered by the Commission regular report. The Union has the necessary tools to do this, in particular within the framework of the European Association Agreement and its bodies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0927"></a>

<p>Mr Aldo Ajello was appointed European Union special envoy in the African Great Lakes region in 1996. His assignment was to support efforts to create the necessary conditions for the lasting, peaceful resolution of the crises affecting the region, by means which would include preparing an international conference on peace, stability, democracy and development in the African Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>During its debate on the conflicts in Africa on 22 May 2000, the Council declared that it actively supported Mr Ajello's work. Each year, the Council has voted unanimously to extend his mandate.</p>
<p>In view of the current state of the peace process in the DRC and in Burundi, and the many summits and meetings (Lusaka, Windhoek, Kinshasa, Tripoli, Maputo I and II, Arusha) which have taken place in recent weeks, and in view of the role which the special envoy can play in mediating and providing information, the Council feels completely justified in extending Mr Ajello's mandate.</p>
<p>It was the Congolese concerned (government, armed and non-violent opposition) who appointed Mr Ketumile Masire "facilitator" of the inter-Congolese dialogue. On 22 May 2000, the Council stated that it supported the inter-Congolese facilitator politically. Moreover, it welcomed the support already promised or provided by the Member States and the Commission and called upon them to examine the possibility of lending the facilitator further financial and logistic support. It is not for the Council to decide whether Mr Ketumile should continue in this role.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to the resumption of structural aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Development Fund Committee recently issued a favourable opinion on the strategy document proposed by the Commission. It will hence be possible to open negotiations with the Congolese authorities with a view to signing a National Indicative Programme.</p>
<p>In its statement of 22 September 2000, the European Union called upon the governments of Uganda and Rwanda to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1304 immediately and to implement the proposals for redeploying troops in the DRC.</p>
<p>The restoration of the integrity of the DRC and the other States involved in the conflict is a priority policy for the Council. The EU's main objective remains the creation of conditions which will make it possible to achieve lasting resolution of the conflicts affecting the region. This resolution will, of necessity, have to lay down respect for international law and international principles, security guarantees for all people, an end to impunity and respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0934"></a>

<p>Since May 2000, the Human Rights Committee of the Turkish National Assembly has published new reports on the conditions in Turkish prisons and police stations. These reports indicate improvements that have been made between 1998 and 2000, particularly with regard to the attitudes of police and prison staff. They also strongly criticise the absence of monitoring and inspection of the system by governors and prosecutors. However, the prison conditions are still worrying. The fact that this debate has begun in Turkey is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>It is also notable that the authorities are currently carrying out a restructuring of the entire prison system (the construction of a new type of prison, the gradual compliance with international minimum standards, collaboration with the Committee for the Prevention of Torture).</p>
<p>The Council has always been sensitive to the situation in Turkish prisons. This issue is included in the Accession Partnership which was the subject of a political agreement with the Council on 4 December 2000. The improvement of prison conditions is included in the short- and medium-term priorities and objectives within the framework of enhanced political dialogue and political criteria. The guarantee of the right to freedom of opinion and freedom of expression, in relation to political and religious issues, is also part of the short- and medium-term political criteria.

<p>There is much concern today in civil society about the so-called 133 Committee and how the EU position in the WTO negotiations is decided by civil servants in a very non-transparent manner.</p>
<p>The following demands to improve this process have been made by NGOs and civil society movements:</p>
<p>the European Parliament should be involved in trade negotiations and fully and formally informed about the activities of the European Commission and the 133 Committee;</p>
<p>codecision procedures should be applied so that the Council and European Parliament share decision-making on trade and investment;</p>
<p>-	the Article 133 Committee should be required to make all documents publicly available, ensure representation of a fair and balanced viewpoint that includes sustainability, and be open to parliamentarians.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's view of these demands?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the desire to increase the transparency of common trade policy and democratic control by Parliament.</p>
<p>In fact, the involvement of Parliament not only conforms to the concept of European construction but is also a necessary supplement to the democratic control which national parliaments exercise over the governments of the Member States. Furthermore, it strengthens the Community’s negotiation position with regard to third countries. In fact, those countries know that the Commission negotiates with the full support of the democratically elected representatives of the European citizens.</p>
<p>That is why, as the honourable Member will know, the Commission had proposed the revision of Article 133 within the framework of the current Intergovernmental Conference. In particular, its proposal, which is supported by the European Parliament, intended Parliament to be closely involved in all the stages of commercial policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these proposals have not been accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference. The Commission must therefore continue to do its best to ensure that Parliament is closely involved while respecting, of course, the framework laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p>With regard to the Article 133 Committee, the Commission would remind you that this is a Council committee. The Commission therefore has no power to decide which documents debated in that committee can be made public. That committee’s transparency rules, with regard to other institutions and the public, depend on the decision of the Council.</p>
<p>In relation to its own documents, the Commission applies a great degree of transparency in its relations with Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0914"></a>

<p>At the end of October, 11 banks signed an agreement aimed at preventing criminal organisations from using banks to launder money and in so doing agreed a code of conduct which will place the burden of responsibility for checking the authenticity of the money they receive on the banks. Private bankers in Geneva have dismissed the idea as a public relations exercise. What is the Commission's response to this new code and does it consider that such an initiative could have helped to thwart the efforts of former Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha to launder almost £3 billion in UK and other banks, and will it request that the results of the investigation by the (London) City's Financial Services Authority into the destination of part of these funds is made public and, where possible, followed up at EU level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of, and welcomes, the Global Anti-Money Laundering Guidelines for Private Banking (also known as the "Wolfsberg Principles"), which were endorsed by 11 leading international banks at the end of October.</p>
<p>This appears to be a significant initiative given the public commitment of the prominent banks which have signed up to the principles and the involvement of Transparency International and respected international experts. The Guidelines pay particular attention to the risks involved in providing private banking services to high net-worth individuals, certain of whom may be public officials or have close links with such officials. The Commission has no information on the views of other private bankers. However, it believes that there is an increasingly wide international consensus that all countries and the whole of the financial sector must participate actively in the global fight against money laundering.</p>
<p>Having originated as part of the effort to combat drugs trafficking, the campaign against money laundering has recently become increasingly broad-based as regards the underlying criminality the proceeds of which are targeted.</p>
<p>Within the Community, the Common Position adopted by the Council on 30 November 2000 on the proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money laundering directive requires the Member States to oblige their financial sector and other professions to report their suspicions of the laundering of a wider range of serious crime, including corruption.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that this extension, together with the publicity given to cases of high-level corruption and stolen public assets, and the resulting public revulsion at such cases, will make banks even more careful as regards the origin of their clients' funds. Failure to apply adequate know-your-customer principles and to ask the necessary questions expose them not only to a serious reputational risk but also to disciplinary measures or even prosecution.</p>
<p>With regard to the Abacha case in particular, the Commission is aware that the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) is carrying out an investigation into the procedures followed at the banks which appear to have handled the funds in question. The FSA has stated that remedial action will be ordered where problems are found and that any evidence of criminal activity will be passed to the relevant criminal prosecution authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0943"></a>

<p>Counterfeiting is of concern to the Commission because it has negative consequences on the proper functioning of the Single Market, including on innovation, employment and competitiveness. In addition, it misleads consumers and, in certain cases, puts public health and safety at risk. It also creates a barrier for European exports and investment in third countries.</p>
<p>To prevent counterfeit goods from being placed on the Community market, the Commission has taken a number of initiatives aiming to ensure the effective protection of intellectual property rights. These initiatives are general in nature and do not apply to particular types of products.</p>
<p>As regards the control of the external border of the Community, Council Regulation (EC) No 3295/94, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 241/1999, laying down measures concerning the entry into the Community and the export and re-export from the Community of goods infringing certain intellectual property rights, aims to prevent the passage of counterfeit and pirated goods through the external borders of the Community. This Regulation allows the national customs authorities to suspend the release of goods suspected of being counterfeit or pirated while the right holder instigates infringement proceedings before the national court.</p>
<p>As regards the Internal Market, the Commission adopted on 30 November 2000 a follow-up communication to its 1998 Green Paper on Combating Counterfeiting and Piracy in the Single Market. This Communication contains an Action Plan announcing a series of practical measures aiming to improve and strengthen the fight against this phenomenon in the single Market. This Action Plan will be implemented progressively and will involve all the parties concerned. As part of these measures, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a Directive harmonising the legislation of Member States on the means of enforcing intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework, the Community monitors the way in which WTO members implement the agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS), which establishes minimum standards of protection and lays down procedures for ensuring their effective enforcement. The Community also negotiates bilateral agreements with WTO and non-WTO members, which require a high level of protection and fighting against infringements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0861"></a>

<p>A process is under way in Greece to revise Article 24 of the country's constitution concerning the protection of the natural environment with the inherent risk that this will pave the way for the removal of the protected status of woodland and its use for building. Obviously, the revision of a country's constitution is a matter solely for that country but, by ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam (Articles 2, 174, 152 and 153), Greece has made certain specific commitments in this respect. Furthermore, there is a risk that the ostensible 'improvement' of Article 24 might nullify the 5<span class="sup">th</span> action programme on the environment and sustainable development, the 1992 Rio Declaration, certain specific provisions of Greek national legislation as well as international and Community rules incorporated into that legislation at a time when woodland in Greece is becoming increasingly scarce among the chaos already typical of town and country planning in Greece.</p>
<p>In the light of these circumstances, does the Commission consider that the revision of this controversial article – which has provoked a storm of protests from environmental organisations, associations, other bodies and eminent legal experts – is consistent with its environmental protection policy, and will it make recommendations to the relevant Greek authorities to persuade them to respect the obligations which they themselves have entered into, and the conclusions adopted as the outcome of various international procedures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The complaint in question was examined by the Commission.

<p>This being said, the sanctions to which the honourable Member refers are, pursuant to Article 228 (ex Article 171) of the EC Treaty, only applicable to a Member State which has not complied with a judgement of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p>At present, the infringement procedure in question is still at an early stage and no application has been made to the Court of Justice in this case. Therefore it would be premature to presume that a sanction will be imposed on the Member State in question with regard to this case. In any event, the aim of the infringement procedure is to resolve the situation of non-conformity with Community law as soon as possible rather than obtaining a judgement which imposes sanctions.</p>
<p>If a sanction for non-compliance with a judgement of the Court were proposed, it would be calculated in accordance with the principles stated in the Commission's communication relating to the method of calculation of penalties provided for in Article 228 of the EC Treaty, as published in Official Journal C 63 of 28 February 1997, page 2.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the United Kingdom Government on 8 November 2000 was the introduction of some form of road user charge, such as a ‘vignette’, payable by all road hauliers, British and non- British alike, for their use of the road network in the United Kingdom. There is therefore no suspicion of the announced measure introducing direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the haulier or the origin or destination of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Provided that the details of its implementation respect all relevant rules and in particular the requirement of non-discrimination, direct or indirect, such a charge seems to be in line with current Community law, Directive 1999/62/EC<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>. This Directive, adopted by unanimity in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply (time related) user charges or motorway tolls. The overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the Community internal market.</p>
<p>By 1995, 12 out of the 15 Member States have adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis put on direct charging (user charges or motorway tolls) and less on taxes. The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems, which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network. The measures announced by the United Kingdom signal such a re-adjustment of its charging system.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the above mentioned Directive provides for the possibility of special arrangements to be made for border areas by the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission is following closely the development of the British scheme, which will be subject to a consultation procedure, in order to ensure its full compatibility with Community general principles and specific legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Since February 2000, the Commission has pledged a total of &#x80;73.5m for the floods crisis and subsequent reconstruction effort. This figure breaks down into :</p>
<p>Emergency humanitarian aid</p>
<p>&#x80;6m of ECHO (European Commission Humanitarian Office) funding to finance emergency relief and resettlement operations carried out by 20 of ECHO’s NGO partners, and monitored by ECHO staff on the ground.

<p>&#x80;5m from the NGO cofinancing budget line, following a special call for proposals in the flood-affected areas. Contracts to be signed before end December to ensure follow-on to the support provided by ECHO.</p>
<p>&#x80;2.5m for the rehabilitation of rural telecommunications. Fully committed.</p>
<p>&#x80;2m for demining, to deal with landmines displaced by the floods. Fully committed.</p>
<p>&#x80;8m as an increase in the ceiling of infrastructure projects (road and railway), to cope with additional flood damage.</p>
<p>&#x80;20m, fully committed or disbursed, for the post-flood rehabilitation of the urban infrastructures of the towns of Chokwé and Xai-Xai in Gaza Province, as well as the rehabilitation of the flood protection mechanisms along the Limpopo River. Engineers under contract to the EC have been working on the spot since early September.</p>
<p>&#x80;12m reserve for interventions to be identified.</p>
<p>Longer-term development</p>
<p>&#x80;13.5m balance of payments support, committed and authorised for payment, to help the Government deal with the knock-on effects of the floods.</p>
<p>Substantial increase in levels of disbursements for normal cooperation in Mozambique. Payments, which averaged &#x80;60-80m in the past years, increased to &#x80;120m in 2000 and are expected further rise to &#x80;150m in 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p>It is too early to undertake a full assessment of the Community support for emergency and re-construction following the floods in 2000 in Mozambique. However, close coordination on the ground involving the Commission Delegation and the ECHO staff seconded to Maputo, has allowed the Community interventions to target the most critical needs. Several field missions have checked the situation and the implementation of projects, and measures have been taken, where necessary, to improve delivery of aid. At the same time, the use of flexible and accelerated procedures has allowed rapid disbursement of funds.</p>
<p>The Commission's assessment is that the 2000 floods will have a relatively important knock-on effect in the economy, resulting in a slowing down of growth and increased inflation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0887"></a>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the problems related to the control of classical swine fever.</p>
<p>Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve the situation, including the financing of a large-scale laboratory trial on the recently developed “marker vaccines”.</p>
<p>Very recently, on 15 September 2000, the Commission made a proposal for a new Directive on the control of swine fever, which takes into account the lessons learned from the outbreaks, which recently occurred in Europe and the development of new vaccines.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission’s proposal includes provisions on vaccination, which are fully in agreement with the opinion delivered by the Scientific Committee on this issue in 1997.</p>
<p>A return to a generalised preventive vaccination policy is not foreseen by the Scientific Committee and by the Commission’s proposal for three main reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason concerns the questionable results of a policy of preventive vaccination as regards the protection of the pig population in the Community.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the ban of preventive vaccination, the number of outbreaks of classical swine fever has decreased in the last decade, although slightly, in comparison with the previous ten years when vaccination had been widely used.</p>
<p>The second reason regards the high costs of a generalised vaccination policy.</p>
<p>If this policy was applied in the Community, more than 200 million pigs should be vaccinated each year. The cost of vaccination would probably exceed EUR 100 million per year.</p>
<p>Finally, the consequences on the export of pigs and pig products from the Community in the case of swine fever vaccination, must be taken into account.</p>
<p>The trade of vaccinated pigs and their meat cannot occur freely at international level as the vaccinated animals, if infected with classical swine fever virus, might act as apparently healthy virus carriers and further spread the disease.</p>
<p>At this moment, the degree of self-sufficiency of the Community in the pig sector is about 107%. In the case of vaccination, serious restrictions to exports would be applied by many of the Commission's trade partners, particularly by the most important ones such as the United States where vaccination is banned. As a consequence, the whole pig sector in the Community would suffer in such a very serious crisis.</p>
<p>However, the new proposal of the Commission includes provisions on the potential use of marker vaccines, in the framework of the current non-vaccination policy.</p>
<p>This policy already foresees the possibility for an emergency vaccination after an outbreak of disease, if there is the risk that the situation goes out of control.</p>
<p>In principle, the marker vaccines might allow the discrimination between vaccinated and healthy pigs and the vaccinated but infected ones. The trade of the animals recognised as not infected, as well as of their products, might then take place. This might allow a more extensive use of vaccination with these vaccines.</p>
<p>However, there are still a number of technical problems to be solved, as shown by the trial supported by the Commission. These problems are related to the efficacy of the currently available marker vaccines in emergency situations, as well as on the reliability of the accompanying discriminatory tests.</p>
<p>Therefore, the approach of the Commission on the use of these vaccines is rather cautious.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to make a preventive vaccination field trial, as it is not possible to predict in which area of the Community the next outbreak of classical swine fever will occur.</p>
<p>Only in this case, the efficacy of a preventive vaccination might be properly evaluated. In addition, the pigs located in the area where such a trial was carried out would be subject to certain restrictions to trade, at least until the results of the trial suggest that preventive vaccination is not harmful for the remaining pigs of the Community.</p>
<p>For these reasons, any field trial in the Community is not feasible, unless one wishes to consider as a trial an attempt to control the disease in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>And this is already part of Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0891"></a>

<p>The international press reports that the Algerian Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Yazid Zerhouni, refuses – in violation of the procedures provided in law for setting up political associations and parties – to recognise the WAFA party led by the former minister, Ahmed Taleb, which has been set up in full compliance with current legislation. This party, which aims to reconcile Islam and the modern world and which could make a significant contribution towards reviving the country's ailing democracy and, therefore, strengthening the rule of law, finds itself subjected to a ban on the well-worn pretext that it would represent 'a threat to State security'.</p>
<p>What initiatives has the Commission taken, or will it take, to persuade the Algerian authorities to respect their own laws and thereby also promote the revival of democratic debate and the political process, thus enabling Algeria to emerge from the serious crisis in which it finds itself?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the Algerian Government has refused to authorise the creation of the WAFA political party on the grounds that this was nothing more than an underhand attempt to resurrect the dissolved former Front Islamique du Salut party. Confronted with the government’s resolve, Mr Taleb did not persist in founding the party and did not instigate any legal proceedings against the government's decision.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, political issues are raised in dialogue between the Algerian authorities and the European Union. This political dialogue takes place at ministerial level, twice a year in principle and whenever necessary in Algiers, involving the Member States' ambassadors and the Commission representative. When the current negotiations leading to an Association Agreement between the European Union and Algeria have been completed, and when this agreement has been ratified by both parties, political dialogue will obviously take on an institutional dimension which is lacking at present. Moreover, in line with the customary terms of association agreements, respect for human rights and democracy will become crucial components of Euro-Algerian relations. In this respect, it must be emphasised that the European Parliament, through its resolutions and interparliamentary meetings, contributes significant added value to the political dialogue between the European Union and its partners of the South and East Mediterranean.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0893"></a>

<p>The Commission very regularly visits all Member States to verify on-the-spot the application of all bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) related Community legislation. Inadequate application has been observed in some instances. Such observations have led to amendment of Community legislation, to commitments from the Member States to correct the shortcomings, to follow-up inspections or to starting of infringement proceedings.</p>
<p>With respect to the enforcement of the ban on meat-and-bone meal Community rules for control of certain processed animal protein into ruminant feed entered into force in July 1994. However, cases of BSE have been recorded in animals born in 1995 and later years in certain Member States.</p>
<p>Community inspections have identified systematic failures in the implementation of Community rules in several Member States. Certain Member States have also reported deficiencies in their implementation of Community legislation on animal feed and have, as a consequence, adopted safeguard measures.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, as a precautionary measure, the Commission proposed a temporary prohibition on the use of all animal protein in animal feed, pending a total re-evaluation of the implementation of Community legislation in Member States. This prohibition was adopted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 4 December 2000.</p>
<p>On the extension of the BSE testing programme to all Member States, a reinforcement of the Community wide measures has been adopted since the question was tabled. As of 1 January 2001, all bovine animals over 30 months of age subject to special emergency slaughter or showing symptoms of (any) disease at normal slaughter must be tested. In addition the number of random tested dead-on-farm cattle has been increased. The requirement to test will be extended from 1 July 2001 to all cattle aged over 30 months slaughtered for human consumption. The Agriculture Council of 4 December further agreed, that a "purchase for destruction" scheme should be introduced to remove from the food chain all cattle aged over 30 months unless tested negative for BSE.</p>
<p>As regards the application of the precautionary principle the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member of the comprehensive proposal on food law, recently transmitted to the Parliament and to the Council. One of its important elements is indeed the establishment of the precautionary principle in Community food safety legislation. In short this principle dictates that Community risk management measures need to be taken whenever a risk to health is identified but scientific uncertainty persists.</p>
<p>On the international stage, the Commission has insisted that consideration is given to the precautionary principle in Codex Alimentarius. Discussions are still underway.</p>
<p>As far as oilseeds and protein crops are concerned, the honourable Member will be aware of the commitment entered into at the last Agricultural Council, and indeed confirmed at the Nice European Council meeting. The Commission will rapidly analyse the supply and demand for oilseed and protein crops and will communicate its conclusions to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>No countries other than the United Kingdom and Portugal have been declared to be particularly at risk. For these two Member States special Community measures are in place, notably the embargo on live cattle, meat-and-bone meal and beef based products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0896"></a>

<p>The Commission is as concerned as the honourable Member about the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people and in particular on the children of Iraq. But let us be clear. This suffering is the result of the continued Iraqi refusal to accept UNSCR 1284 and to cooperate with the UN. In doing so, the Iraqi Government carries full responsibility for delaying the lifting of sanctions.</p>
<p>Of course the Commission would like to see a return to normality in Iraq. Ways should therefore be pursued to engage the Iraqi Government in a dialogue on the implementation of and compliance with UNSC resolutions so that sanctions can be lifted. But ultimately, the decision to lift sanctions remains with the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>The Commission follows the humanitarian situation in Iraq closely. The Commission continues to try to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people through the humanitarian aid provided.</p>
<p>Since the Gulf war in 1991, the Community has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq with over EUR 251 million. An amount of EUR 8.5 million has been allocated from the 2000 ECHO budget.

<p>With reference to Mr Moscovici’s answer to my question and supplementary question of 14 November (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0854_EN.html">H-0854/00</a>), it remains entirely obscure why the Council thinks that the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments will in itself do anything to secure due fulfilment of the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, now repeated in Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter.</p>
<p>I refer to guarantees such as the right to defend oneself in person or through legal assistance of one’s own choosing or, if one has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; to have the free assistance of an interpreter if one cannot understand or speak the language used in court; right to trial within a reasonable time, or to release pending trial.</p>
<p>Does the Commission share the Council’s apparently groundless confidence that mutual recognition of judgments is likely to be of any value in raising standards in this domain? Will it consider the desirability of a delay in relation to mutual recognition pending adequate observance of existing guarantees? Does it agree that there is now an historic opportunity to move towards general adoption of ‘best practice’ standards?

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the two issues of mutual recognition of judgements on the one hand and respect for the rights of the parties of the procedure, but also of third persons, such as the victims of crimes over which criminal procedures are held on the other hand are very closely linked.</p>
<p>The Commission thus very much welcomes the fact that the conclusions of the Tampere European Council in the chapter dealing with “mutual recognition of judicial decisions” several times make reference to the latter question: Conclusion no. 34 speaks of “minimum standards on specific aspects of civil procedural law”, conclusion no. 35 asks for transfer of persons who are fleeing from justice to be done “in compliance with Article 6 TEU”, and the same conclusion demands that fast track extradition is to be accomplished “without prejudice to the principle of fair trial”. Finally, conclusion no. 37 asks for work to be launched on those aspects of procedural law on which common minimum standards are considered necessary in order to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition”.</p>
<p>It would thus appear that the Tampere European Council has clearly steered the Union towards a system in which while decisions are to be allowed a much greater “freedom of movement”, these same decisions will have to come out of procedures that satisfy certain standards. Some of these standards may exist already, some may still have to be established.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0903"></a>

<p>The plan is, at this stage, just a draft which is likely to be subject to modifications following the completion of the formal consultation process which is now underway and a legal requirement to be fulfilled before the Plan can be submitted to the Spanish Parliament for discussion and approval.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the honourable Member mentions in her question, Spain has notified full transposition measures for both the Wild Birds directive and the Habitats directive<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>.</p>
<p>However, on the occasion of Mr. Matas' visit, the Commission brought to the attention of the Spanish authorities the need to ensure, in the course of the formal adoption procedure of the final Plan, and later on in the process of its implementation, the full respect of all relevant Community environmental legislation and policy. This includes of course the Water Framework Directive, and Community legislation concerning the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora as well as environmental impact assessments.</p>
<p>At this stage, the plan still being a draft document, it would be premature to presume conflicts between the Plan and existing Community legislation or policy. However, the Commission is currently examining the draft plan, and should shortcomings be identified, they will be swiftly brought to the attention of the Spanish authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>What is the current state of EU/US negotiations on an ‘Open Skies’ aviation agreement?</p>
<p>Does the Commission recognise that such an agreement could result in predatory airlines cherry-picking major routes?</p>
<p>Furthermore, is the Commission aware that such an agreement could have a devastating effect on certain airports and their economic hinterland, such as Shannon in Ireland, which have already experienced major difficulties as a result of the abolition of intra-EU duty-free?</p>
<p>Common Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is not at this stage negotiating with the United States on “open skies”. The Commission has, already in 1995, proposed to the Council to agree on a common position towards the United States with the aim to conclude a so-called Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA), which would establish an open, competitive air transport market based on a convergent and harmonised regulatory environment, similar to the one which currently contains the internal Community air transport market. The Council is currently considering this proposal which increasingly is gaining support both on an industrial and political level.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that her proposal creates a fair and level competitive playing field between the Community and the United States and would thus contain the best possible commercial environment for all United States and European stakeholders; i.e. airlines, workers, consumers and airports alike. This European approach of the transatlantic relations has to be appreciated in a context of traffic growth and airport congestion and then will permit a more efficient utilisation of all the airport capacities.</p>
<p>How and when the final arrangement shall take shape, will depend on the discussion in the Council and the possible negotiations with the United States, when such negotiations will ultimately be held. The Commission is well aware that the situation regarding particular airports, like e.g. Shannon, would require specific attention and has already expressed in the Council its readiness to take into account the effects of the present bilateral agreement between Ireland ant the United States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The case to which the honourable Member refers is Case C-117/00, Commission v Ireland and inter alia concerns Ireland's compliance with Article 3 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> in relation to the Red Grouse, Lagopus lagopus.</p>
<p>Article 3 provides that, in the light of a number of requirements (ecological, scientific, cultural, economic and recreational), Member States shall take the requisite measures to preserve, maintain or re-establish a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for all wild bird species.</p>
<p>While certain species of wild bird (those listed in Annex I of the directive as well as those that regularly migrate) benefit from the more specific habitat conservation requirements of Article 4 of the directive, this is not the case for Lagopus lagopus. Hence the importance and relevance of Article 3. As the honourable Member correctly indicates, Lagopus lagopus is huntable under the terms of the directive, being listed in Annex II. However, this case does not relate to hunting of Lagopus lagopus. Moreover, the fact that a species is huntable does not necessarily imply that its habitats are unthreatened, or that they do not require preservation, maintenance or re-establishment. Good conservation and management of habitats would indeed benefit recreational uses such as hunting.</p>
<p>The distribution of Lagopus lagopus is naturally restricted by the species' intimate dependence for food and nesting on heather moorland. A study of Lagopus lagopus in Scotland notes: "Heavy grazing reduces heather cover, standing crop, shoot production and perhaps most important, the heather's carbohydrate reserves.

<p>In its recent report on shipbuilding in the world, the Commission concludes that the European market is still beset by considerable problems thanks to South Korea's dumping practices, which have driven prices down and led to a loss of orders for European shipyards to the benefit of their South Korean counterparts.

Nonetheless, it appears to remain committed to ending the system of state aids to shipbuilding at the end of 2000, despite the opposition of a number of Member States which have expressed their willingness to prolong these aids.</p>

<p>The Commission fully shares the honourable Member’s concern about unfair South Korean practices.</p>
<p>In its report adopted on 15 November, the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 had not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices. However, among the various actions proposed, it committed itself to examine, as soon as possible, the possibilities to propose measures to address the Korean problem in accordance with the Regulation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, at its meeting on 29 November 2000, the Commission reaffirmed that it is against any prolongation of operating aid. It also indicated that if, in the framework of the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR) procedure, it does not achieve a negotiated solution with Korea satisfactory for the Community, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in order to seek remedy against unfair Korean practices. In addition the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure. This mechanism will be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that Community industry has been directly injured by unfair Korean trade practices.</p>
<p>The Commission also declared its willingness to allow greater use of State aid for research and development (R&amp;D) in the shipbuilding sector and recalled that substantial funding is also available under the Community research framework programme. In addition Community shipyards will continue to be able to benefit from other aid possibilities such as investment aid for innovation, regional investment aid for the modernisation of existing shipyards, as well as restructuring and closure aid, where necessary, to help in the process of structural adjustment and reconversion to other activities.</p>
<p>These views were presented to the Industry Council on 5 December 2000, which welcomed the Commission’s determination to tackle the problem of unfair Korean competition and took note of the Commission’s proposals in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0922"></a>

<p>The honourable Member will be aware that the new law governing public investment and the structural funds in Greece was approved on 31 October 2000. Moreover, the Community Support Framework for Greece for the 2000-06 programming period was signed on 27 November 2000. This means that two important steps forward have now been taken.</p>
<p>As regards the Cohesion Fund, the Greek authorities have submitted during the recent weeks a substantial number of alternative project proposals. It has also been possible to clarify the technical content of several projects that were problematic. As a result, the prospects for full use of the commitment credits available to Greece are much improved, subject of course to the final stages of internal consultations.</p>
<p>The difficulties with some of the Cohesion Fund proposals should be seen as start up problems at the beginning of a new funding period. The Commission will work with the Greek administration from the beginning of next year to ensure a smooth examination of Cohesion Fund projects in future.</p>
<p>Following adoption of the Community Support Framework, the next step is the approval of operational programmes. The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that the basic elements of the new management structures required by the Structural Fund Regulations will be in place and operational by January or February 2000, including the management information system. In these circumstances, a first set of operational programmes should be ready for approval at that time with the first payments of Community credits following immediately after.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0928"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member’s point of view regarding the special significance of the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004, since the Games are to be held in the country that was the cradle of the ancient Olympic spirit.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games provide the host country – and Barcelona and Albertville in 1992 were an excellent illustration of this – with an opportunity to project its image worldwide. From this point of view, the Games can have a stimulating effect on the host country’s economy. This is the reason why it has been possible to cofinance extensive redevelopment works in the Attic region under the Structural Funds. It is likely that, in the new programming period 2000-2006, a number of infrastructure projects will prove indirectly useful to the organisation and conducting of the Olympic Games, even though the main criterion for their selection was their positive impact on the long-term socio-economic development of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for sport has made contact with the Greek authorities in order to look into a possible collaboration with a view to giving the Games a European dimension, including in terms of cultural aspects to which the Commission attaches great importance. Avenues for cooperation are being examined by both parties and the Commission hopes to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with the Greek Government and the organising committee.</p>
<p>By way of example, the Commissioner responsible for sport has already launched the idea of making the Athens Olympic Games exemplary in the area of combating drugs in sport. Furthermore, as she has already announced before this Chamber, on 7 September 2000, the Commission is considering the possibility of proposing that the year 2004 be declared the ‘European Year of Sport’ in order to highlight the importance of this activity for European society.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0929"></a>

<p>The CE marking is the only compulsory marking for PPE. It is a graphical declaration of conformity to the PPE Directive. Member States must take all appropriate measures to ensure that, for equipment covered by the PPE Directive, only those items that bear the CE marking are placed on the market and brought into service.</p>
<p>A number of sporting competitions are governed by strict requirements covering the equipment which may be employed. These requirements may be dictated in the interests of safety, or in order to ensure that differences in equipment do not have undue influence on the outcome of competitions. Sporting organisations may accordingly impose such requirements without necessarily infringing competition law.</p>
<p>The information at the Commission’s disposal is not, however, sufficient for it to intervene in the instance to which the honourable Member refers.

<p>Toys and disposable items containing mercury button-cell batteries are becoming increasingly common. According to Sweden's National Environmental Protection Agency, about 50% of these batteries (equivalent to 50 kg of mercury per annum) may end up in household refuse and the mercury may be discharged into the environment via refuse incineration plants and refuse tips. Pursuant to an EC directive, button-cell batteries may contain up to 2% of mercury by weight, despite the fact that there are alternatives to mercury, such as lithium.

If Member States intend to introduce stricter rules as regards the mercury content of batteries, such rules need to be notified according to Article 95 (ex Article 100 A) (4) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The planned revision of Directive 91/157/EEC and the proposed directive on electrical and electronic waste will contribute to improved collection via the collection of all batteries and the collection of equipment containing batteries. Both initiatives require the establishment of databases in order to enable the monitoring of the material flows. Reliable data on mercury originating from batteries in the waste stream and their impact on the environment are currently not available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0933"></a>

<p>The earthquake which hit Attica on 7 September 1999 caused severe damage to tens of thousands of homes, public buildings, schools and professional premises.

<p>Immediately following the earthquake which struck Attica in September 1999, the Commission received a request from the Greek authorities for financial aid from the Community in order to deal with the difficult situation caused by this event. On 15 October 1999, the Commissioners responsible for regional policy and for employment and social affairs visited Athens in order to take stock of the damage and to discuss solutions with the Greek Government.</p>
<p>The Commission looked into the possibilities which existed in accordance with the regulations for eligibility for expenses laid down in the structural fund regulation, and came to an agreement with the Greek authorities for the reassignment of a sum of EUR 44.4 million from the European Social Fund (ESF) from the Community support framework 1994-1999, for measures and action to assist the earthquake victims. These measures and actions were part of the operational programmes for combating social exclusion (EUR 19.2 million), lifelong training and the promotion of employment (EUR 7.2 million), industry (EUR 6.75 million), Attica (EUR 2.25 million) and health and welfare (EUR 9 million).</p>
<p>As regards the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Greek authorities requested cofinancing up to an amount of EUR 370 million under the Community support framework 2000-2006 for Greece and within the operational programme for the Attica region. The request covered projects to restore basic infrastructure as well as the educational, health, culture and production infrastructure affected by the earthquake. The above-mentioned operational programme is currently under negotiation and should be adopted at the beginning of the year 2001. It should also be pointed out that the expenditure available under this programme is eligible as of 1 January 2000.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the Structural Funds regulations do not permit cofinancing of residences, the Greek authorities approached the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a loan to enable them in turn to cofinance loans for the reconstruction of residences affected by the earthquake. On 10 December 1999, the EIB therefore granted Greece a loan of EUR 300 million, and of this EUR 150 million have already been paid out. The loan is to be administered by the Greek Ministry for the Economy, which is the only body currently in a position to provide more detailed information regarding the ultimate beneficiaries. The EIB is currently awaiting information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in November 2000, the Commission proposed to the Council that Greece be granted a loan of EUR 2 million in order to relieve the burden of interest payments on the EIB loans for the reconstruction of the region destroyed by the earthquake in September 1999. In the same proposal for a Council decision, the Commission also requested that it might be authorised to use future increases in the relevant budget line with a view to supporting measures in order to relieve the burden of interest payments on the loans granted by the EIB for reconstruction of the Attica region following the earthquake in September 1999. The Ecofin Council approved this proposal for a decision from the Commission at its meeting of 27 November 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0940"></a>

<p>A deficit in commitment appropriations remains from the last structural funds programming period which has caused the Commission to make an incorrect assessment of the requirement for appropriations. According to the Commission proposal, this deficit will be covered out of the commitment appropriations earmarked for innovative measures for the current programming period. The proposal is hard to understand, and contains a confusion between the funds intended for different purposes in the two programming periods.</p>
<p>In the Agenda 2000 review, appropriations for innovative measures were cut in favour of the Urban programme. The European Parliament considered in its resolution of 7 July 2000 that the resources allocated for innovative measures should be maintained at the level of the decisions made at Berlin. This was also enshrined in the declaration and Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure. According to the declaration contained in the agreement, the reduction in the appropriations for innovative measures should be compensated for by releasing EUR 200 m from the flexibility instrument.</p>
<p>How can it be possible that innovative measures are losing money as a result of delays by the Commission? What can be done to ensure that the innovative measures receive the money they have been allocated, as agreed at Berlin? What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that similar problems do not arise in future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This issue was raised at the time when transfer 40/2000 was adopted. This transfer was intended to supply commitment appropriations of up to EUR 160 million to the lines for the completion of the Structural Fund projects scheduled for the previous period. The appropriation available within the 2000 budget were to be used for lines earmarked for, on the one hand, for technical assistance and innovative measures (EUR 104 million) and, on the other hand, for Community initiatives (EUR 56 million).</p>
<p>The Commissioner responsible for regional policy has already had occasion to write a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets (COBU) explaining the reasons for this transfer. In particular, the aim was to fulfil the legal commitments entered into under the Edinburgh agreements which it was not possible to pay for in full out of the budgetary framework applicable en 1994-1999 since the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement did not provide for any adjustment of the financial perspectives in the event of underimplementation of the budget in the years 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that the amounts withdrawn as part of the above-mentioned transfer are valid in legal terms and neutral in budgetary terms. More specifically, with regard to innovative measures, it should be pointed out that the appropriations earmarked for innovative measures are not covered by multiannual programming or a priori distribution between Member States. As a result, any appropriations which were not used in 2000 would be rescinded, with the risk that they would be lost permanently.</p>
<p>Thus, transfer 40/2000 made it possible to fund the commitments left over from the previous programming period by using the available appropriations intended for technical assistance and innovative measures. The underimplementation of appropriations for innovative measures in 2000 is a result of the need to consider the content of these projects, to modernise their management and to programme their implementation in close collaboration with the Parliament and the other institutions and committees concerned. It was not possible to complete this process of consideration, planning and consultation within time limits that were compatible with committing the appropriations for 2000, even though such activities will serve to guarantee the efficiency and proper administration of these projects throughout the rest of the programming period.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern to implement innovative measures within the limits of the total budgetary appropriation decided in Agenda 2000. To this end, the Commission has presented guidelines to Parliament for the implementation of innovative measures under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the period 2000-2006. The total budget appropriation allocated to them for this period is estimated at EUR 400 million.</p>
<p>This amount may be increased if this is possible in terms of the requirements for Community action, resources available, budgetary conditions and implementation capability. In this context, the Commission will carefully examine the possibility of using the flexibility instrument provided for in Paragraph 24 de Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, in accordance with Declaration No 5 appended to this agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0941"></a>

<p>The Commission has for a long time now been contributing to research into the potential effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. Under the third and fourth framework programmes for R &amp; D, it financed a number of projects aimed at determining the effects of electromagnetic radiation (radio frequencies) on health. The first was a COST action (COST 244, 1992; COST 244a, 1998) concerning the biomedical effects of electromagnetic radiation. This action brought together experts from 17 countries and resulted in substantial contributions (as regards research and standardisation) in Europe and beyond (e.g. in the WHO). The latest projects have recently been concluded, and their results will be given wide dissemination. A follow-up is being prepared. Two studies on the links between electromagnetic radiation and cancer have also been financed under the BIOMED 2 programme.</p>
<p>Under the Measurements and Testing Programme, a project was financed for measuring electromagnetic radiation from mobile telephones and masts and quantifying human exposure to radiation. The results of this project will facilitate the establishment of acceptability standards for appliances, and will also contribute to determining the degree of comparability of the results of the various research efforts now under way into risk assessment.</p>
<p>The total budget devoted by the Community to these studies was approximately EUR 2 million. None of the studies (which included the thermal effects of energy absorption and possible disturbances of metabolism from the various types of electromagnetic field) has pointed to adverse effects on health; nonetheless, additional results are needed if public concern is to be allayed in full.</p>
<p>The subject of electromagnetic radiation has therefore been specifically included in the fifth framework programme, within the working programme of key action 4 (environment and health) of strand 1 (quality of life and management of living resources). Following the 1999 call for proposals, five proposals were accepted involving total funding of approximately EUR 9 million. These projects, essentially concerning the potential carcinogenic effects of radio frequencies, got off the ground in early 2000 and are expected to bear fruit in three or four years' time.</p>
<p>These projects include a large-scale epidemiological study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the International Centre for Cancer Research and aimed at determining whether electromagnetic radiation from mobile telephones can cause cancer. The other projects are aimed at improving understanding of the biological mechanisms by which electromagnetic radiation can influence human health (and, in particular, cause cancer): the means employed include using test batteries in both experiments on live mice and rats and in an in-vitro context (new molecular biology techniques).</p>
<p>The studies under way, which are targeted primarily at potential carcinogenic effects, will be supplemented by the 2001 call for proposals under the key action for the environment and health. This will be specifically targeted at quantifying exposure to electromagnetic radiation and at other potential effects on health. It will make it possible to obtain scientific data which can be directly used for improving risk assessment.</p>

<p>The Commission is nonetheless continuously following the results of the latest scientific studies, as well as the opinions of its Scientific Steering Committee, to ensure that it can, at any moment, take the legislative action required to guarantee continued high standards of health protection for the citizens of the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
