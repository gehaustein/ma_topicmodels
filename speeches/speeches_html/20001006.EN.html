<p class="contents">Last week, on 24 September, an extremely important referendum was held, in which the Danes rejected the single currency. Yesterday, the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point, which led to a further fall in the euro’s value. There are two conclusions to be drawn here. Firstly, the public will never take any interest in our debates if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussions on every important issue. Secondly, the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bank guarantees individual loans freely in accordance with its own criteria and not the precise guidelines laid down by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Union has fixed a ceiling for the loans it guarantees. The loans are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65% of the final total for loans for the period 2000-2007. For the rest the bank must itself obtain other forms of security or cover the risk itself. In practice there is no risk and the European Investment Bank would even be prepared to lower the percentage the EU guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loans from the EIB. For each guarantee, funds are transferred from a special reserve into the Guarantee Fund, with a maximum amount decided in the finance frameworks contained in the interinstitutional agreement. In 2000 a maximum of 204 million euros can be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund. Technically 9% of the sum for EIB loans should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund, a figure representing 65% of the nominal value of the loans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Guarantee Fund in the budget is also used for macroeconomic aid to non-EU countries. It is a cheap way for the Member States to grant development aid. These loans are granted on political grounds to the EU’s humble partners and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by the Guarantee Fund, unlike the Investment Bank loans.</p>
<p class="contents">In macroeconomic aid it is often a question of the EU’s share in an overall package in which other sources of aid are the World Bank and the IMF. Generally, financial aid to non-member countries is granted in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criteria set by the IMF – the more guarantees are given for Investment Bank loans, the less macroeconomic aid can be granted, and <span class="italic">vice versa. </span>The Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loans to support the development of core industries in non-member countries, although no transfers from the reserves to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sorts of loans in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantees for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007, and produced a list of non-member countries that would be entitled to receive aid. The European Parliament adopted a position on the matter in a report by Mrs Rühle in autumn 1999. As Parliament has been heard, the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the terms and conditions of the guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must today decide a very simple matter: whether Croatia should join that group of countries to which the European Investment Bank may grant loans with an EU guarantee. Croatia is no longer at war and democratic change has taken place there. So there are good grounds for the country joining the group of borrowers, just as there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate. If Parliament could table amendments to the Council Decision it would certainly remind us of Croatia’s unemployment and social problems, which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen, but there is no legal basis here for such amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discussed soon in Parliament regarding Turkey joining the group of those countries receiving loan guarantees given by the EU to the European Investment Bank. Parliament is bound to have a lot of conditions it would like to impose on loans to Turkey, but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word. Today we add Croatia to the list of those receiving guarantees and then it will be Turkey’s turn.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserves will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loans we can expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Naranjo Escobar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, this proposal for a Council decision with a view to extending, for the first time, the Community guarantee for the European Investment Bank undoubtedly has a truly extraordinary scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Before commenting specifically on the issues raised by this proposal for a decision, I should like to express our support for it, since it endorses Parliament’s position on relations between the European Union and Croatia. For this very reason, I wish to state from the outset that I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteur a few minutes ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve, whose narrow margin could cause problems should any unforeseen events occur.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one decision that must be put in a dual context. We should consider Croatia’s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view. We must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there, following the legislative and presidential elections. The European Union must encourage Croatia to remain firmly grounded in democracy and the rule of law and there is no doubt that this encouragement must be translated into action involving financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the Croatian people to make the necessary sacrifices to balance out the fundamental deficits in their public accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB can and must play a leading role in the region, but this powerful financial instrument serving the external policy of the Union, whose activities, in accordance with the mandate provided by the 1999 decision, cover more than sixty countries, must match its actions to those of the Commission. It must also be made clear that the Commission cannot distance itself from the recent agreement that was reached in the tripartite dialogue in July, when a commitment was given to the effect that every new proposal’s compatibility with existing financial programming must be substantiated in the financial statement.</p>
<p class="contents">From the operational point of view, I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that has been provided for in the current financial perspective, and the functioning of the Guarantee Fund require an improvement in the mechanisms for achieving the objectives of quality and efficiency in Union loans that are given budgetary guarantees. In this sense, the rapporteur’s analysis strikes me as being an admirable starting point. It does not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the EIB. The Interinstitutional Agreement provides for a series of three-part dialogues to take place within the budgetary procedure. Given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve, which is set at EUR 200 million per year, there is no reason why we should not discuss the priority uses of this margin in coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is clearly to improve the efficiency of the European Investment Bank. In order to achieve this, the Commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of its activities will be carried out. We cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees. In the budgetary procedure for 2001, our political group has maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanisms for monitoring its performance. It is time to call for the same objectives with regard to the activities of the EIB. What is clear is that Parliament cannot restrict its role to passively assimilating the information supplied to it by the Commission and the EIB, or to giving its blessing to the decisions of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iivari (PSE).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (FI) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion, which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loans granted to Croatia, deals with two important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the political situation in Croatia has improved dramatically. The new government is committed to political and economic reform. That is an opportunity for the European Union to continue once more with cooperation, which was interrupted in 1995 when Croatia began military action in Krajina.</p>
<p class="contents">The other message is contained in Croatia’s still very difficult economic situation. For years the country practised an economic policy based on plundering, which has left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Esko Seppänen, says quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social conditions in Croatia are difficult and the Community’s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">An important political change was seen in Croatia in the parliamentary elections that were held earlier this year. The country’s inhabitants showed by voting that they demanded democratic change. The new government was made up of a democratic frontline of six parties, which has a firm majority in the country’s parliament. The government has indicated it is rapidly recognising the values of European democracy and the rule of law. In foreign relations it gives priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework. In its programme, the government is committed to such matters as a respect for human rights and the rights of minorities, the repatriation of refugees, improved relations with its neighbours, and considerable economic reform. Legislation is already in place to achieve these aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relations between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years. Between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place, whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, talks on the Stability and Association Pact with the country should be started as soon as possible. The Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme, which relates to higher education, should extend to Croatia. In July the Commission freed 10 million euros to support the repatriation of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal under discussion contains a target figure of 250 million euros in EIB loans for Croatia for the period 2000-2007. With that sum, it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure projects and environmental investment, the development of industry and SMEs, housing reconstruction, urban renewal and tourism. The plans are in accordance with projects that were put forward by Croatia at the Regional Funding Conference held in March.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s leaders are committed to difficult but necessary economic reform. The cure will be hard to endure, but, hopefully, the loans now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effects of economic reform on the lives of the people. We also have to remember that Croatia has good industrial manufacturing plants, a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunities for the development of tourism, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">According to a survey by the Commission the country’s competitiveness in European markets could be strengthened enormously with a raft of consistently applied and ambitious structural reforms, but at present many Croatian businesses still have problems competing in the free economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The events in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues. This week, in the wake of the Presidential elections, we have followed the situation in Yugoslavia with bated breath. The winds of change are blowing in Belgrade too. The international community has already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanctions are being lifted. The European Union and the European Parliament have every reason to support positive developments in the Balkans. Instability in the region is a threat to Europe as a whole. We know that nationalism and poverty mean war. Ahead of us there is a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also, for our part, have to clear the barriers to effective assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, interinstitutional discussions on next year’s budget – in particular section IV on financing – still appear to be very difficult for the time being. Hopefully, the signs of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage us to find a solution to the problems of the budget and its financial perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place there. In somewhat less dramatic style, Croatia changed governments last year. In any event, the election victory of the opposition was given the same recognition. This is why it is possible to pick up where we left off in 1995. The chances of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into, and it is expected that negotiations on this topic will begin before the end of this year. A delegation of the European Union has been primed for action, and as you know, the Summit at the end of November will take place precisely in Zagreb, in order to give Croatia the message that the country is welcome in European Union circles.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt. In its recent past, Croatia has witnessed dramatic changes for the worse and widespread corruption. Let us not forget that, until recently, Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand, and which benefited only one individual. This whole process will need bolstering, which will require enormous investments – investments in infrastructure, in the environment, but also investments in very risky operations.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, setting up small and medium-sized businesses in that kind of country is risky. Things can go wrong, and this also applies to the reception of refugees, an investment goal which was lacking from the rapporteur’s report, unfortunately. These too are risky investments. It is therefore only justified that the mandate of the European Investment Bank will be increased by 250 million. The European Union is acting as guarantor.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is exactly where the problem lies, because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of Serbia, namely the fact that the Council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the Balkans last year in Berlin. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I know that the members of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleagues for continually wanting more funds for the Balkans, and for having to enter into negotiations with the Council, which is not always that easy.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is very definitely a real problem. I mentioned it yesterday when we were debating Serbia and I am repeating it here. It is not acceptable that the rift between the pledges and promises made by the European Union on the one hand, and the reserved funding on the other hand, should be as huge as it is now threatening to become. Having spoken fine words yesterday and having granted this guarantee today, the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow. I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also, and mainly, the Council, to stick as closely as possible to the Commission’s proposal during the next couple of months of negotiations on the budget for next year and subsequent years, the reason being that, in my view, the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia, but also in other parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the Balkans. I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is right in saying that this loan is important, but that, in the final analysis, the overall programme, given the necessary financial backing, is more important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance, but political assistance also entails financial support, because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability. This can only be achieved, of course, if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere. There is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed. In the final analysis, the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">The contribution under discussion, which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007, may not prove to be a milestone, but it would certainly help the process on its way. The course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome. However, the problems that have come to light and which are as yet unresolved, are something else altogether. It is generally the case that new political challenges demand increased financial outlay, but not – I might add – at the expense of others. Therefore, we must think in general terms – and hopefully arrive at positive political decisions – firstly, about increasing the reserves for the guarantee fund, and secondly, about the fact that it must not be left solely to the Council to determine how the residual margin is to be used, and thirdly, about establishing binding criteria for the effective deployment of the EIB loan, so as to be able, at the end of the day, to monitor whether this package is actually consistent with the necessary objectives for which it was intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, living through these dramatic hours, we look to Belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present us with a real democracy in the course of the next few years. Yet there is still a huge question mark hanging over all this. We want to support and welcome the process, but we must not get carried away. Croatia started building a democracy as long as ten years ago. Democratic elections were held there in 1990, which the international community deemed fair and free. Following these elections the former Communist government, under the leadership of the present Prime Minister, Mr Racan, stepped down in a disciplined manner and a new democratic development began under the Tudjman government. According to the international community though, a few cracks started to develop in this administration, and the situation went downhill from there.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now consider the bigger picture. Looking back, not only did this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty years of Communist government – and all Central and Eastern European States, including the candidate states still have their work cut out there – a third of this country was occupied by foreign troops under the Dictator Milosevic, who held office at the time and is still in office today. A third of Croatia was occupied, and it was many years before the country was reunited and a democracy established which – and this is a point worth emphasising – led to a peaceful change of government. The current administration did not take over under the conditions faced by, what will hopefully be the future government in Belgrade, because the previous government in Croatia stepped down after free and fair elections, and then a new government took office. It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation. Democratisation took place in Croatia ten years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also recognise what remarkable achievements there have been over the past ten years in terms of building a market economy, democracy and a constitutional state. Mr Langendijk is right, some colossal mistakes were made with privatisation. There was corruption on a massive scale, but if you take a look round the associated countries, the candidate states, you will detect the same trend there. The current democratic government in Croatia and its democratic opposition, need our full support. I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payments. But we must be clear in our own minds that this is only a first step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Markov was right to point out that funds are scarce, and that this can only be a first step. Our aim must be to forge ahead down this path, not just by providing more funds, but, above all, by sending out political signals. To this end, we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia, which will spell out that this is a European country that has a definite future as a member of the European Union. I therefore say ‘yes’ to financial aid, and ‘yes’ to this guarantee, but, at the same time, would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European, and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country, and to include it in the list of candidate countries, because I believe Croatia has earned our full support. This could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to its rejuvenation.</p>

A clique which referred to itself as socialist, but managed to stay in power for more than ten years by using fascist methods alone. Along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence, this also manifested itself in the fact that fear was instilled in the people of Serbia vis-à-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">The same formula has been applied in Croatia over the past ten years. Croatia is not one of the states we have been discussing this week as being potential future candidate states of the Union. In many respects, the position of that country is the same as that of Slovakia, which is now a candidate state. Up until 1918, both regions were rebellious sections of Hungary and boasted their own language, culture and identity, but were thwarted by the official state authority. International pressure forced them thereafter not to become fully independent, but to join new large collective states which were intended as melting pots for minor Slavonic peoples, but they never managed to integrate properly.</p>
<p class="contents">When half a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time, they became vassals of the Hitler regime. In 1945, the outside world agreed that these states should cease to exist permanently. With the benefit of hindsight, this was a silly move. Ignoring the wish of those peoples to be able to make independent decisions, provided the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for years, a nationalism which had little consideration for the tragic legacy left by the Nazi era and which was hostile towards other peoples and democracy at home. People hid behind Tudjman and Meciar because they saw this as the only guarantee for being treated as equals vis-à-vis their neighbours who used to rule over them. It is only now that all their reasonable demands have been met and nobody doubts the right to independence any longer, that nationalism is fading away and normal political alliances are emerging. The nationalists recently lost political power in both countries. This could serve as a lesson for other strongly nationalist regions. The only way to eradicate nationalism is to meet all reasonable demands of those nationalists.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now every reason for treating Croatia in the same way as Slovakia and other Central European countries which can join the European Union if they so wish. The damage done by the war has not yet been cleared, as we witnessed recently. The country’s road infrastructure is vulnerable because Dalmatia and Slavonia form the two halves of a pair of scissors, as it were, with Bosnia being wedged in the middle, which, particularly in West Herzegovina, is also populated by Croats. The environment in the large population concentrations in Zagreb, Rijeka and Osijek is at risk. This set of circumstances will probably necessitate huge investments, which will not be repaid until later on in the form of tourism and new industry. This is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangements at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the rapporteur, I do wonder whether the funds will be made available in real terms, especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large funds shortly and the Union’s budget is not being increased. There is little point in the European Union making pledges to crisis areas and candidate states left, right and centre, which it cannot meet. As far as Croatia is concerned, there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement. The comment which my colleague Mr Papayannakis made yesterday about admitting Serbia to the European Union should also apply to Croatia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is another individual measure that has been well received today. Of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade. We must immediately appeal to the military and the police, in no uncertain terms, to throw their full weight behind democracy, and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power – which was triggered by the outcome of democratic elections – proceeds peacefully over the next few hours. We have every intention of recognising these democratic elections and the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course my country, Austria, in common with all the other European countries, will also have to do its bit towards the reconstruction of Yugoslavia, in tandem with the European Union. We will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanctions against former Yugoslavia is implemented in full.</p>
<p class="contents">Our honourable friend, Mr Posselt, was correct in what he said about the developments in Croatia. But we are all agreed, nonetheless, that the parliamentary and presidential elections that took place in January 2000 have produced a new political climate. The new government has reinforced its commitment to political and economic reform. This will have a positive effect on relations between Croatia and the EU. The European Union’s response to this development has been not only to appoint the advisory EU-Croatia Task Force, but also to develop the office of the special representative in Zagreb into a permanent representative office of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the feasibility report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, compiled in May 2000, the Commission reaches the conclusion that the conditions for taking up negotiations with Croatia have been fulfilled. The delegations from the Croatian Parliament and from our own, have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate. The Council held in June established that all the preconditions to commencing negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement had been meet. In July, the European Commission forwarded the draft of a negotiating mandate to the Member States, for them to comment on. Austria, the country I come from, was one of the first three Member States, to make a positive statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I mention this development in the year 2000, after the election, is because it shows that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund. We have already come a long way. We must single-mindedly pursue the process that started in May and July as far as an Association Agreement. Croatia and the region deserve this in the interests of peace within Europe.</p>

Even if it is now technically possible to return, much more has to be done to make the return of Serbs to Croatia and the Krajina in particular positively welcome. Much physical restoration is required in that sad part of Croatia. We in the European Union must insist that this is positively encouraged and not just a nominal gesture. Our financial contributions should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the Commission that this aspect will be taken into account.</p>

Even if there is the happy, democratic outcome, which we hope for in Serbia, there will still be great resentment resulting from what happened with the Kosovo campaign and our recent relationships with Serbia.

<p class="contents">Meanwhile the new government in Croatia is clearly demonstrating its serious commitment to putting that country on a secure democratic path and to implementing the political and economic reforms necessary to adhere to the conditions of the European Union stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans. Taking account of those advances last May, the Commission produced a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia and on 19 July recommended opening negotiations. This constitutes a major step forward in EU-Croatia bilateral relations. The Commission hopes that a decision can be taken in November so that negotiations can start without too much delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential for the Community to provide appropriate financial support for Croatia. The resumption of EIB lending is intended to assist the country's investment activities in infrastructure and private sector development. The new Croatian leadership clearly needs dependable and sustained backing to pursue demanding reforms. The proposal before the House would cover up to EUR 250 million of lending over the next four years. As Mr Purvis has just said – and I fully acknowledge – that must be regarded as part of a process of normalisation, stabilisation and progress that extends over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has not proposed any amendments. I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal as an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent.</p>

<p>The Communication of 16 May 2000 on the reform of the Community's External Assistance identified the establishment of an Interdepartmental Quality Support Group (QSGI) as one of the main actions to improve the consistency and quality of programming.</p>
<p>The mandate of the QSGI was adopted by the Commission in July 2000 and the personal representatives of the Commissioners have now been nominated. The first meeting of the QSGI is taking place this week.</p>
<p>The establishment of the QSGI was one of the top priorities in the implementation of the reform of external assistance. There has been a short delay compared to the initial calendar to make sure that the best people were appointed as the personal representatives of the Commissioners. In no way does this short delay, however, question the Commission's commitment to development policy priorities.</p>
<p>One of the very first tasks of the QSGI will be to define the substance and methodology for an enhanced system of multiannual aid programming by country and by region. This methodology will, inter alia, assess whether the analysis of six common elements contained in the Framework for Country Strategy Papers has been carried out in a thorough way and is relevant to and consistent with the proposed strategy. The Framework should be adopted at one of the next General Affairs Councils (GAC) or Development Councils, after fruitful coordination between the Commission and the Member States. Furthermore, the QSGI will examine the usual four criteria of pertinence, feasbility, viability and impact for programming documents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0785"></a>

<p>The December 1995 "Memorandum of Understanding on the closure of Chernobyl by 2000" between the G7 and the Ukraine includes a number of commitments for both sides. In particular, these require the Ukraine definitively to close the Chernobyl plant in 2000. The Commission welcomes the recent confirmation that this will happen by 15 December this year. In the discussions with the Ukrainian authorities the Commission will continue to press for improved levels of nuclear safety throughout the country and for reform of the energy sector more generally. In this context there is also included in the Memorandum a point related to the energy investment programme. This programme is intended to identify least-cost power supply investments to meet Ukraine's future national power requirements. Besides the completion of the Khmeltnisky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear plants other non-nuclear projects are also included, like thermal and hydro plants rehabilitation and pumped storage projects.</p>
<p>Licensing of nuclear installations within Member States is the responsibility of national safety authorities. Under Chapter 3 of the Euratom Treaty, the Community is responsible for ensuring the protection of the health of the general public as well as of workers in the nuclear industry. In this context, the Commission has issued several Directives and Regulations, in addition to the specific provisions on environmental protection laid down in the Treaty itself. These competences do not directly relate to nuclear safety of the installations, but do address the possible consequences of an emergency, including on the territory of other Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0711"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully committed to Agenda 21 and supports its implementation. Europe showed leadership at the 1992 Rio summit, at its 5-year review, and intends to make a substantial contribution to Rio+10. The EC Treaty identifies sustainable development as an objective that permeates and guides Community policies, and the Fifth Environmental Action Programme “Towards Sustainability” was a reflection of Agenda 21 at European level.</p>
<p>Although the Community has developed a number of innovative policies and activities to implement Agenda 21, it is not easy to point out all the specific measures undertaken in relation to promoting Agenda 21 in the Community. These include, inter alia:</p>
<p>- The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund promote a more balanced socio-economic development in the Community. The Funds are increasingly drawn on for environmental improvement projects, to clean up polluted areas, to promote environmentally friendly agriculture, and to provide support for conservation, public transport and environmental management training. Recent reforms mean that environmental concerns must now be addressed systematically in all programming and evaluations.</p>
<p>- LIFE is the financial instrument supporting Community environmental policy. It co-finances actions both in nature conservation and in other environmental fields, both within the Community and outside it. For additional information, please refer to </p>
<p>- The Commission also has other mechanisms to finance sustainability within the Community, including information and awareness. For further information, please see</p>
<p> In addition, the Commission contributes a substantial amount to NGO activities in line with the objectives set out in Agenda 21, also with regard to public awareness raising.</p>
<p>At the global level, the Community is a major aid donor: together, the Community and its Member States provide more than half of all development aid. Environment and, more generally, sustainable development concerns, have become a priority in development cooperation policy. Sustainable development provisions have been built into programmes financed under the Lomé and the new Cotonou Conventions, cooperation with Asian and Latin American States (ALA), the Mediterranean, and the Phare and Tacis programmes. In addition, there are specific budget lines for NGO cooperation and for supporting environment and tropical forest projects in developing countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0732"></a>

<p>In the course of a visit to Catania arranged by the FAO, Mr Segre Colet, lecturer in anthropology at Hamburg university and Mr François Feral, lecturer in public law at Montpellier university, replying to a journalist from the Sicilia newspaper (on 28 August 2000) on the subject of how, and to what extent, industrial fishing had affected, and continued to affect, the fauna of the Mediterranean, stated that `industrial fishing should completely disappear from the Mediterranean´. The two FAO experts said that industrial fishing vessels did not comply with the periods laid down for fishing and were exploiting maritime resources in such a way as to drive certain species of fish to extinction. Moreover, by failing to adjust to the Mediterranean ecosystem, industrial fishing had interfered with species' reproductive cycles.</p>
<p>Does the Commission endorse the opinion of the two experts in question? If so, what action is it taking – or does it intend to take – to protect the fauna of the Mediterranean?

<p>On recent Olympic Airways flights from Athens to Germany, on Saturday, 2 September to Munich (flight OA 175) and on Wednesday, 6 September to Frankfurt (flight OA 165) I witnessed a breach of the Community's principle of the free movement of persons and in particular the application of the Schengen Agreement in the European Union: German police officers were stationed at the aircraft exit and requiring the passengers to show their passports before allowing them to leave the aircraft. In response to my efforts to explain to them that this action was a breach of the Schengen Agreement they replied provocatively that they were carrying out the orders of the airport police authorities and were not concerned about any consequences.</p>
<p>What action does the Commission intend to take to remedy this situation, which is an affront to the dignity of the European public and will undermine its belief in European unification?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>In order to correctly assess the case reported by the honourable Member, we should mention the principles of the Schengen Agreement with regard to the crossing of internal borders:</p>
<p>- Article 2(1) of the Schengen Convention stipulates, “Internal borders may be crossed at any point without any checks on persons being carried out.” According to a decision by the Executive Committee in 1994, that means that all travellers, whatever their nationality, are exempt from checking carried out by border police on the grounds that they are crossing a border. Since 26 March 2000, this has also been applicable to passengers on flights between Greece and Germany.</p>
<p>- The terms of Article 2(2) authorise a Contracting Party, subject to public order or national security requirements, to reintroduce border checks appropriate to the situation for a limited period. In principle, if this safeguard clause is implemented, it should be initiated through a consultation procedure. According to the information available to the Commission, Article 2(2) was not implemented by the German authorities at the internal borders mentioned in the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>- Article 2(3) of the Schengen Convention stipulates, “The abolition of checks on persons at internal borders shall not affect … the exercise of police powers by the competent authorities under each Contracting Party's legislation throughout its territory.”</p>
<p>Internal borders and the bordering area are not therefore a proscribed area where no checks may be carried out.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Executive Committee’s decision, however, substitute border checks are incompatible with the terms of the Schengen Convention on the elimination of checks. Substitute checks are understood here to be systematic checks carried out on people on the grounds that they have crossed a border in an area in close proximity to the border or in determined border areas. As far as the Commission is concerned, it is clear that this principle defined by the Executive Committee regarding internal land borders is also, by analogy, applicable to airports.</p>
<p>All these Schengen instruments have been integrated into the European Union framework, and the Council has determined the legal basis for these in the first pillar. Monitoring the implementation of Article 2 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement is therefore carried out according to the principles governing the monitoring of the application of Community legislation.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission does not have sufficient information regarding the reasons why, and the conditions in which, the checks at Munich airport reported by the honourable Member were carried out, which would make it possible to determine whether these checks were “substitute border checks” or general police checks of the type which may be carried out throughout the territory. The Commission cannot, consequently, give an immediate opinion as to whether these checks are concordant with the above-mentioned principles or not.</p>
<p>The Commission will not fail to request clarification from the German authorities regarding the case raised by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0736"></a>

This objective has not, however, been achieved in full and efforts still need to be made in order to make a genuine comparison between the situations in the various Member States possible.</p>
<p>The European Union Action Plan on Drugs 2000–2004, which was endorsed by the Santa Maria Da Feira European Council, stipulates that the Monitoring Centre must, by the end of the year 2000, complete its work on the five epidemiological indicators and also the indicators for drugs-related crime, the availability of illegal drugs and social exclusion related to drugs, and shall present an annual report to the Council’s Horizontal Group on Drugs on the convergence of the main indicators, the progress made in this area and proposed actions for the following year intended to resolve any outstanding problems.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Centre made a commitment to submit to its Management Board by January 2001 a report on its views on the criteria and definitions to be used to implement the key five epidemiological indicators at national level, thereby making it possible to overcome the omissions in definitions and methodologies. The implementation of these criteria by the Member States will make it possible to carry out the necessary harmonisation to be able to carry out a comparison of epidemiological statistics on drugs between Member States.</p>

<p>On 11 September 2000 the Greek Ministries of Agriculture and of the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works announced the measures to be taken concerning genetically modified cotton which has been illegally imported into and cultivated in Greece. As part of these measures the Ministry of Agriculture has arbitrarily set the contamination level of the seeds at 1% and decided that the crop of fields sown with less than 1% of the genetically modified product need not be destroyed, while in the case of fields in which the degree of contamination of the seeds is above 1% the cotton should be ginned in separate ginning plants and exported. These measures are in breach of Council Directive 90/220/EEC<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and pre-empt a final decision by the Community institutions.

<p>Just a few weeks after taking office, the new Commission wished to indicate its determination to continue the Commission’s action in favour of the outermost regions.</p>
<p>To this end, the Commission organised a partnership meeting on 23 November 1999 bringing together Members of the European Parliament from these regions, the representatives of Member States, regional and local authorities, the Commission President and several other Commissioners and Commission departments.</p>
<p>This event enabled the Member States to present the broad guidelines of their memoranda, and gave the various participants the opportunity to draw the Commission’s attention to any particularly sensitive areas or to their priorities. The purpose of this day’s event was to initiate constructive dialogue with a view to preparing the Commission’s report on the implementation of the new Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty. At this time, the Commission did not make an express agreement to draw up practical measures to adapt the milk quota system to the Autonomous Region of the Azores, as the honourable Member claims.</p>
<p>This report was adopted on 14 March 2000, and does not contain any specific reference to the Azores milk quota system. It should be noted that, neither in the memorandum on implementation of the new Article 299(2) nor in its requests for revision of POSEIMA, did Portugal include any specific request regarding the Azores milk quota.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April 2000, the Portuguese authorities informed the Commission of a problem involving exceeding the milk quota in the Azores. This is an important and problematic issue, in view of the Community regulations on milk quotas. The matter is currently being examined in detail within the Commission, but as yet no definitive conclusions are available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0749"></a>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the potential difficulties of lack of accessibility faced by certain islands and peripheral regions. For this reason, in the case of Ireland, programmes to improve transport links have from the beginning featured prominently in the Community’s interventions under both the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</p>
<p>In the period of the first two Community Support Frameworks, from 1989 to 1999, actions to reduce the impact of peripherality covered almost every aspect of transport infrastructure : the upgrading of strategic road corridors and main railways, the development of regional airport and port infrastructure and improving traffic management. In total, more than &#x80;1700 million have been spent under the Structural Funds on transport-related activities during the period.</p>
<p>Between 1993 and 1999, this has been supplemented by actions under the Cohesion Fund, where approximately &#x80;million, amounting to half the available resources, have been devoted to the development of the trans-European road and rail networks, including major projects to improve port and airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>For the current programming period, running to 2006, an Operational Programme for Economic and Social Infrastructure will devote some &#x80; 530 million from the Structural Funds to transport infrastructure investment. A particular feature of the proposals is the commitment to upgrade the main inter-urban road network to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard by the end of the programming period.</p>
<p>Under the separate Regional Operational Programmes, there will also be contributions from the Structural Funds for the development of local roads, while national resources will be freed for the development of ports and regional airports. In addition, expenditure on transport of some &#x80;280 million will be provided from the Cohesion Fund in the period up to 2003.</p>
<p>These actions, which form part of an overall programme of investment in transport infrastructure in Ireland of some &#x80;10 billion over the programming period, underline the continuing commitment of the national authorities and the Community to improving mobility within the country and its accessibility to the rest of the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0750"></a>

<p>On 15 September 2000 in Brussels, the Commission President met with the President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang. According to many reports, notably those drawn up by the United Nations, Equatorial Guinea continues to be governed by an autocratic regime under which human rights are systematically violated. Mr Obiang has thus failed to comply with any of the undertakings given to the international community, including the EU, concerning democratisation of the country.</p>

What undertakings did Mr Obiang give? Was his attention drawn to the democratic clauses included in agreements between the EU and Equatorial Guinea?

<p>The meeting between the Commission President and President Obiang took place in the context of the political dialogue which the Commission has with the ACP countries that signed the Lomé Convention IV and the Cotonou partnership agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission called upon President Obiang to comply strictly with the recommendations given in Resolution 2000/19 of the United Nations Commission for Human Rights. In particular, the Commission stressed that the technical assistance schemes in support of civil society and promoting the rule of law and good governance should be backed up by the monitoring activities to be carried out by the Special Representative of the Commission for Human Rights and by the United Nations’ special rapporteurs.</p>
<p>President Obiang put forward a national plan for governance subdivided into four sub-sections (executive power, legislative power, judicial power and human rights). This represents a firm official commitment by the government in these areas.</p>
<p>In discussion, the fundamental principles contained in Article 5 of the Lomé Convention IV a and in the Cotonou agreement were brought to the attention of President Obiang.</p>
<p>An initial Community investigation mission was carried out in 1998 and a report was issued. A joint EU/Inter-Parliamentary Union mission is currently in the country examining a programme in support of civil society and promoting the rule of law and good governance. This mission’s report will be available by November 2000 at the earliest.</p>
<p>The Commission pointed out to President Obiang that, as can be observed in other countries, the discovery and exploitation of petroleum resources are not necessarily linked into the country’s social development: the Commission will therefore assess the country’s development on the basis of the results achieved in the social sectors and, given that the level of available resources has increased in the meantime, expectations regarding results will also have increased.</p>
<p>Public finances nonetheless remain one of the weakest links in the administration of Equatorial Guinea, which suffers from a chronic lack of human and, at least thus far, financial resources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0754"></a>

<p>Since 1994, with a view to providing support for adjustments in fisheries and the restructuring of the fisheries sector, the Commission has had at its disposal a wide range of socio-economic measures to support employment:</p>
<p>- through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), productive investment leading to the creation of jobs and diversification of activities has been encouraged in areas dependent on fisheries (ADFs), in particular in ADFs in Objective 1 areas, which include the peripheral least developed areas;</p>
<p>- the European Social Fund (ESF) finances training courses for fishermen designed to improve their qualifications (new technologies, on-board safety, the environment, etc.);</p>
<p>- the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) supports job-creating investment in processing and aquaculture, co-finances national early-retirement aid schemes and grants a premium for the definitive cessation of fishing.</p>
<p>FIFG employment support was strengthened in 1999 by three new measures: (a) a premium for diversification or conversion of activities outside offshore fishing; (b) a premium for young fishermen (below age 35) wishing to purchase their first (second-hand) vessel; and (c) aid for vocational training (as part of collective actions).</p>

<p>The prospects during the next six months for the sheepmeat market both inside as well as outside the Community are encouraging. The outlook is for stability on most markets with prices remaining at reasonable levels. Sheepmeat prices in the Community as a whole are forecast to grow at a rate of nearly 8% during the year 2000 when compared to the previous year. This comes from a combination of factors, such as reduced levels of supply, relatively firm demand and recovery of the skin prices.</p>
<p>On the international side, the Middle East oil producing countries might increase their demand as a result of a rise of their incomes. This might attract a part of the exports coming from New Zealand, the major external supplier of sheepmeat to the Community.</p>

<p>The rate of unemployment in the Community averaged 9.2% in 1999, the third year in succession that the rate has fallen, down from 10.8% in 1996. The rate declined further to 8.5% by July 2000, and is expected to reach 8% by the end of the current year. 14.3 million people are presently out of work in the Community, down from the peak of 18.7 million in February 1994.</p>
<p>Since 1997 in particular, the fall in unemployment has been gaining momentum, reflecting an improved economic situation as well as the impact of reforms in labour markets, driven by the European employment strategy. However, the wide disparities in unemployment between Member States and regions, as well as between genders and age groups, are still a reason for concern. Equally, long-term unemployment, albeit down to 4.2% from 5.3% in 1996, is still high and affects nearly half of the unemployed. This situation calls for continued efforts to raise skills and increase job opportunities for the unemployed, in particular by adopting a more preventative approach, as recommended in the employment guidelines.</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is especially serious among disabled people, although no precise measurement is possible, for lack of data. To focus policy efforts more sharply and create more opportunities for the disabled, the Commission has proposed in the new Guidelines for 2001, that Member States set targets for the implementation of appropriate measures to meet the needs of disabled and other disadvantaged groups. Increased emphasis has also been placed on combating discrimination and promoting social inclusion by access to employment, education and training. Finally, the honourable Member's attention is drawn to the directive for equal treatment in employment, based on Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which, it is hoped, will be adopted in October.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0760"></a>

<p>When speaking about drought in the Horn of Africa, one should put this phenomenon in a certain perspective, as drought in this part of the world is a recurrent event, known for centuries. It has to be feared that this will continue. Recently, however, these droughts have become exacerbated by meteorological phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña. In fact La Niña seems to be at the origin of the more than abundant rains which fell earlier this year in southern Africa while at the same time provoking a prolonged drought in the Horn.</p>
<p>The latest recorded famine in Ethiopia took place in the eighties when the Mengistu regime initially denied the existence of a drought. The international community could thus only intervene after considerable delays. In the meantime techniques to detect drought have improved considerably. Satellite images allow us to estimate, at regular intervals, rainfall received in certain areas and to see the development of the vegetation cover. In this context I am pleased to inform that the Commission finances a global FAO Programme entitled “Système mondial d’ information et d’alerte rapide”. On the local, Ethiopian level, the Commission works very closely with USAID in the production and analysis of bi-weekly satellite images.</p>
<p>The Commission also finances RESAL, the “Réseau Européen de Securité Alimentaire”. RESAL makes analyses of all incoming information related to food security in order to guide the Commission better in matters of food aid and food security. It produces for example statistical data on grain market prices within Ethiopia thus allowing us to detect when market distortions appear. The Community is currently also financing a major expansion of the National Meteorological Services network in Ethiopia. The Commission has a local Food Security Unit in Addis, like in many Sahel countries. This Unit is following the food security situation in Ethiopia very closely, carrying out a multitude of activities ranging from grain production estimates to follow up on NGO interventions.</p>
<p>The drought of 2000 was an extension of similar but less severe droughts in 1999 and 1998. In conformity with normal nomadic practice, herders left their usual place of living in search for water and grazing for their animals. However due to insecurity, travel of expatriate staff of all aid agencies had to be discontinued. Regular monitoring of the nutrition status of the nomadic population became thus very difficult.</p>
<p>Food shortages in the Horn of Africa are frequent in Eritrea, Somalia and parts of Sudan and Kenya while chronic in Ethiopia. This chronic food deficit in Ethiopia is due to a structural deficit in food production, recurrent drought as well as socio-political and economic factors. As problems in Ethiopia are more of a structural nature than elsewhere, the Commission has, over the years, been paying considerable attention to the long-term perspective of the food situation in Ethiopia and a policy of food security rather than food aid has been pursued.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0761"></a>

<p>In accordance with Council Directive 95/21/EC on Port State Control (PSC), the inspection of foreign flagged vessels by the port State consists of a document check and a general examination of the overall condition of the ship. This examination may be extended, in breadth and depth, if clear grounds are established to question the vessel's compliance with the international safety standards.</p>
<p>When deficiencies found are clearly hazardous to safety, health or the environment the ship must be detained. The detention order can be lifted only when the hazard is removed.</p>
<p>This means that, notwithstanding the certification issued by or on behalf of the flag State, when there are clear grounds to believe that a vessel does not comply with the applicable requirements, the port State is authorised to take action to ensure that the vessel does not sail until it can do so without danger.</p>
<p>The inspections by the state where ports are located are rightly considered as a fundamental tool to reduce substandard shipping. The Commission action in this field continues to be rigorous. It should be noted that the package of legislative proposals adopted in March with the "Communication on the Safety of Seaborne Oil Trade", foresees a general strengthening of the PSC inspection regime. In particular, the possibility is also proposed to ban from European waters certain vessels which, on the basis of the number of their detentions, are considered to represent a high level of risk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>For the budget for the year 2000, on 26 September, the Commission committed a total of EUR 22 150 725 for Greek Cohesion Fund projects, including EUR 14 231 115 for Transport projects and EUR 7 919 610 for Environment projects. The total anticipated for Greek projects for this same year has been increased from 16 to 18% of EUR 2 659 billion, or EUR 452.03 million, to be divided equally between the ‘transport’ and ‘environment’ projects.</p>
<p>As of 26 September 2000, the situation is as follows for the four countries in receipt of Cohesion Fund monies:</p>
<p>Ireland: EUR 106 billion available, EUR 0.03 billion committed, i.e. 0.0% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Greece: EUR 452 billion available, EUR 22.15 billion committed, i.e. 4.9% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Spain: EUR 1 649 billion available, EUR 432.7 billion committed, i.e. 26.2% take-up of appropriations,</p>
<p>Portugal: EUR 452 billion available, EUR 11.9 billion committed, i.e. 2.6% take-up of appropriations.</p>
<p>A commitment of EUR 1.573.531 has been made for technical assistance.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for the lack of projects which the Commission has received to date. Firstly, following the efforts made to commit appropriations fully by the end of 1999, there were very few requests outstanding at the beginning of the current financial year for funding for new projects. Secondly, in this, the first year of the new programming period, the Member Sates have focused particularly on Objective 1 programming.</p>
<p>The Commission processes the applications for assistance put in by Member States and, after examining them, proposes to adopt them by initially committing the corresponding appropriations. According to the financial regulation, deferment of appropriations may be considered for projects in which the interdepartmental consultation has been completed by the end of the year 2000, with the agreement of the departments concerned. Such deferment of appropriations may be considered for the appropriations corresponding to these projects on condition that they have already been committed prior to 31 March 2001.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission has already approached the Greek authorities in order to encourage them to present their Cohesion Fund projects as early as possible given that, at this stage, the number of projects received is not such as to ensure satisfactory execution of the same. The fact is, if the Member States involved in the Cohesion Fund do not submit an adequate number of projects, there is a risk that some of the appropriations included in the budget for the Cohesion Fund for the year 2000 may be irretrievably lost for the 2000-2006 period covered by the Interinistitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission will redouble its efforts and will continue to liase with the competent Member State authorities in order to ensure the maximum take-up of appropriations by the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0767"></a>

<p>The Commission has already indicated that it regarded as broadly pertinent the action plan set out in its 1997 communication seeking to facilitate industrial restructuring activities and lay the foundations for a European market in defence equipment.</p>
<p>The delay that has occurred in its implementation, responsibility for which lies as much with the Commission as with the Council, has prevented confirmation of the European framework as the source of rules governing a European internal market in such products.</p>
<p>Given that situation, other initiatives, on an intergovernmental basis and smaller in scale, have been taken outside the Community framework, such as the LOI (Letter of Intent) which resulted in the signing in July 2000 of the framework agreement by the six Member States concerned (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom).</p>
<p>That framework agreement includes measures designed to facilitate industrial restructuring activities and the business activities of transnational armaments manufacturers. It forms part of the approach advocated by the Commission for the establishment of a set of harmonised rules for that sector.</p>
<p>It represents a point of departure leading towards European harmonisation which the Commission cannot but welcome. However, the issue of the involvement in the process of the other Member States, which account for a substantial proportion of the defence equipment market, remains outstanding.</p>
<p>The six Member States party to the agreement together account for 90% of the European industrial defence potential, but they do not account for 90% of the market.</p>
<p>Hence the relevance of a Community-wide market in order to create synergies and economies of scale and to stop the gap between the LOI Member States and the others becoming wider.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that one avenue worth exploring might be to seek solutions to these issues that involve all 15 Member States, since these are issues that are, of course, of interest to the Union as a whole, based to the extent necessary on the guidelines laid down by the six LOI Member States. Solutions involving all 15 Member States would enjoy the force of law derived from their status as Community acts.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Commission is continuing to review the measures which might lead to tangible results and, to that end, is taking into consideration the policies and measures developed in parallel which affect the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the direct dialogue between the heads of undertakings in the sector and the Commission will shortly be resumed in order to confirm the approach to be adopted and the specific measures to be taken.

<p>The presence of the British nuclear submarine 'Tireless' in the port of Gibraltar for repairs to its reactor, has alarmed the population of the Campo de Gibraltar area, in view of the acknowledged risk of possible radioactive pollution.</p>
<p>Since the Gibraltar harbour does not even meet the Royal Navy's own conditions for carrying out repairs of this kind, is the Commission going to urge the British Government to take its submarine to an adequate harbour in the UK?

<p>The honourable Member has highlighted a sensitive issue which has recently been the subject of a complaint which the Commission received from a Spanish citizen. This issue is currently the subject of a preparatory inquiry.</p>
<p>It is important to stress, as of now, that the question raised is directly related to the implementation of the Euratom Treaty, and, in particular, the implementation of a number of Euratom directives adopted on the basis of Article 31 (Chapter 3, Health Protection).</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the United Kingdom’s decision to carry out repairs on the nuclear submarine “Tireless” in the port of Gibraltar is a sovereign issue and the Commission does not, therefore, have any specific jurisdiction under the Euratom Treaty to discuss the justification for this decision.</p>
<p>The Commission is, however, responsible for ensuring that Member States implement the provisions of the Treaty and the Community legislation based on this within their own sovereign territory.</p>
<p>It is particularly important, in the case in point, to check with the British authorities that, prior to carrying out the necessary repairs on the “Tireless”, the legal requirements in terms of public information regarding the applicable health and safety measures in the event of a potential radiological emergency were respected, taking into account the proximity of Spanish territory (<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>). It is also necessary to ensure that, in compliance with Council Directive 96/29/Euratom<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the United Kingdom provided an intervention plan for a potential emergency (mobilising the necessary resources) and did so in consultation with the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>In view of the above, the Commission plans to officially inform the British authorities in order to remind them of their obligations. The Commission will keep Parliament informed of any developments in this matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The UK nuclear submarine Tireless, which suffered damage in the Mediterranean, was towed to Gibraltar where, three months after its arrival, it is now undergoing repairs.

<p>Quite apart from the anomaly of there being a British colony on the Iberian Peninsula, does the Commission think that the episode under consideration here should be dealt with on a purely bilateral basis between two EU Member States, or does it feel that it should play some role in the environmental, information, technical or purely political field?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member has highlighted a sensitive issue which has recently been the subject of a complaint which the Commission received from a Spanish citizen. This issue is currently the subject of a preparatory inquiry.</p>
<p>It is important to stress, first of all, that the question raised is directly related to the implementation of the Euratom Treaty, and, in particular, of a number of Euratom directives adopted on the basis of Article 31 (Chapter 3, Health Protection). In the case in point, the Council Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989 specifically stipulates provisions for informing the public about the health and safety measures applicable in the event of a radioactive emergency, taking into account close proximity with another Member State. The Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 further provides that an intervention plan in the case of a potential accident (mobilisation of the necessary resources) should be adopted and should also consider the cross border aspect that the adoption of such measures may have.</p>
<p>The mere existence of Community regulations on the subject, therefore, is of direct concern to the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. It must be added that Article No 10 of the 1989 Directive specifies unequivocally that the Commission be informed, at its request, of measures for the prior information of the population and for the information of parties that might, potentially, be required to intervene in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>These factors will lead the Commission to refer the matter to the British authorities in the coming days in order, firstly, to remind them of their obligations in that area and, secondly, to ascertain the nature of the measures adopted on the basis of the applicable Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0780"></a>
