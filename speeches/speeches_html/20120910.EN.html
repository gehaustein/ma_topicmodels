He will then speak and answer questions in an intensive debate.

The news relates to deaths which, as a result of the summer break, can only now be announced to the House. We mourn our fellow Member, Jiří Havel, a highly respected and much-loved Member, a superb politician whose work in the Committees on Industry, Research and Energy and on Budgets was characterised by high levels of expertise. Mr Havel was a passionate European, an extraordinary man, who will live on in all of our memories and who – I can report this from my own experience – dedicated his whole life to the service of others.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also mourns the loss of Edith Mastenbroek, whose startling death at the age of 37 has left us deeply shocked. She leaves behind a young son, who will now have to grow up without her.</p>
<p class="contents">We mourn for our former Members, Alexander Falconer and Paddy Lane. These were fellow Members who we got to know during previous parliamentary terms, who passed away over the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, Sakharov Prize-winner Oswaldo Payá and his fellow campaigner, Harold Cepero, lost their lives in an accident in Cuba. Mr Payá’s dedication inspired a whole generation of Cuban activists – he inspired them to struggle for freedom and human rights. The thought of arguing, of struggling, for democracy, freedom and human rights, was what Mr Payá lived for, and that is why we awarded him the Sakharov Prize. We will continue to preserve his legacy here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to stand for a minute’s silence in honour of our deceased former Members and the late Sakharov Prize-winner and his companion.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – Ladies and gentlemen, in two weeks’ time, there will be parliamentary elections in Belarus. Parliament has, for a long time, been following developments in that country closely and with great concern. It is with the same great concern that we are watching the continued violations of human rights, the rule of law and democratic values. There are a number of developments that I find particularly alarming, and these include the travel ban imposed on opposition politicians and human rights activists based on laws that expand the powers of the secret police, the KGB, while I am also worried by the recent expelling of the Swedish ambassador.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us in this House call on the dictator to implement reforms and political change. I want to clearly state at this juncture – and this is also a signal to Belarus – that the first step must be the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and their complete rehabilitation. The ongoing detention of Ales Bialiatski, Mikola Statkevich, Pavel Sevyarynets, Syarhey Kavalenka, Dmitry Dashkevich and numerous other political prisoners is unacceptable. I tell you this, because these people should know that we, in the European Parliament, have not forgotten them. There is an institution that is fighting for you, and this is it. We call on the government to ensure that international standards are met in the parliamentary elections, that all the candidates have a fair chance, and that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors are able to carry out their work unhindered.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to inform you that, on 30 August, I wrote a letter to the President of the Republic of The Gambia in response to the execution of nine people. There was a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in The Gambia for a quarter of a century. The cooperation between the European Union and The Gambia is based on the commitment to respect human rights. In my letter, I called, on behalf of the European Parliament, on the government of The Gambia to refrain from further executions and to reinstitute the moratorium on the use of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In a state that sets itself up as judge of life and death, there is no justice, but vengeance. That is our deep conviction and that is why we, the elected representatives of the European people, will continue to fight for the abolition of the death penalty around the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the House, I would like to congratulate our erstwhile fellow Member and Vice-President, Stavros Lambrinidis, on his appointment as the European Union’s first Special Representative for Human Rights, and indeed I have already done so in writing.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You all know Mr Lambrinidis as not just someone who ran votes efficiently in this House. With his experience, his training as a lawyer, his wide-ranging knowledge and his winning personality, he is the right man for the job. I would like to thank you all for expressing, through your applause, the fact that Mr Lambrinidis can count on the support of the Members of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title5"></a><a name="creitem5"></a>

That was the situation – the impasse – we reached at the end of the Danish Presidency.

There is a potential provisional agreement, and I think that I have to wait for it to be submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this is a matter of urgency, because how we collect statistical data – and particularly from regions, which is what this relates to – is very important in being able to prove that there are no surprises in accounts. I am sure that, in terms of economic governance and everything else to do with that, the House will agree with me.

<p class="contents">I should first of all like to tell you that I am personally extremely satisfied with the work of the shadow rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to the debate, whether they are from the Commission or the Council. Together, we have achieved this outcome. What is more, within the space of a year, we have managed to approve one of the two most important dossiers for the internal market, and secured the approval itself at first reading, thereby making the legislative process simpler.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I can clearly declare that this is a real achievement for Parliament, which has played a significant part in arriving at the definitive text of the regulation. As a consequence, Parliament’s role has clearly been reinforced and my wish is that this important institution, which is the one that actually represents the people of Europe, can, in future, have an ever greater impetus and greater involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall now briefly go on to highlight a certain particular aspect of the regulation and bring out the importance of these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, when this regulation takes effect, the system will continue to be based on principles that have now been reinforced; it will therefore be voluntary, private and based on the principle of national delegation. In fact, our intention was not to upset a system that was working and had worked quite well. Rather, it was to identify the adjustments needed to make it more democratic and competitive at the European and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have ensured that stakeholders – that is to say, interested parties – who also have public importance both in the consultation phase, before the mandate is drawn up, and subsequently, can participate more actively and effectively. This is a very important point because it reinforces the democratic nature of the process and the consensus around a standard on the part of all the parties involved, whether they are market players or public players and of public importance. In order to ensure that this consultation takes place in all phases of the process, Parliament has asked the European Commission to create a notification system that will enable stakeholders to register and thereby receive information automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, just as it is proper to ensure that businesses and representatives of the public interest may participate in the system, it is equally important to ensure the presence of authorities and public bodies exercising legislative or administrative functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another particularly important point is the protection afforded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and making their participation in the process simpler. This is something that I personally quite forcefully wanted to include in the regulation, particularly at the national level, because SMEs, either due to their relative size or linguistic difficulties, find it very difficult to take an active part in the system, even though they in fact constitute the economic base on which our European system rests.</p>
<p class="contents">The European level must play its part in ensuring this element of representation, which must, however, take the bottom level as its starting point. This is why we have chosen a bottom-up structure. The system that will take effect will be more coordinated between the different levels involved, from the national level to the European level, and will also be better connected with the international level; this is one of our great ongoing objectives, because it is essential that the European Union promotes and extends its own standards worldwide, so that they become universal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">An important dialogue has been opened with the United States, particularly via the mission that we sent to Washington together with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we are proceeding down that particular road.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has, however, rejected the Council’s request to have implementing acts on technical specifications in the field of ICT, that is to say, for information and communication technologies, because it would have added a tremendous burden to the work of the Commission and slowed down the entire process. Nevertheless, Parliament has ensured that there will be a consultation phase before the Commission can decide whether or not to single out a particular technology.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe I can confirm that the regulation will simplify the entire system in both administrative and financial terms and ensure a higher level of transparency. For example, we have seen to it that the list of harmonised standards that have been subject to a formal objection decision is published on the Commission’s website.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go on talking any further, if only because there are a great number of important issues and I would risk straying too far into the technical aspects of a very complex dossier. I shall therefore leave space for the debate and remain at your disposal for any clarification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You all know that standardisation is one of the major instruments underpinning the European economy. The cooperation between industry users, public authorities and the standardisation organisations in drawing up standards has contributed decisively to what I think you will all agree is one of Europe’s greatest achievements: the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Standards play a vital role in enhancing the competitiveness of European enterprises; they assist access to today’s globalised markets and ensure interoperability, which is vital for competition and developing new products and services. For SMEs, standards are a key tool to help them retain and attract consumers. The reduced risk and increased trust and satisfaction flowing from the use of standards opens markets for them in a secure environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely because of this importance, standardisation must adapt to the new societal changes that we face: the globalised economy, the need for sustainable development, the convergence of technologies protecting the consumer and improving accessibility and inclusion for disabled and elderly people. To address these issues, the Commission adopted the Standardisation Package in June 2011, and I am glad to see that the European Parliament is now discussing the adoption of the final piece of that package: the regulation on European standardisation. This regulation would help to address and solve three problems.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the speed of mandated standardisation. The planning and transparency of Commission mandates asking the European standardisation organisations to draw up standards in support of the legislation and policies will be improved through the annual work programme and by means of financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the inclusiveness of European standardisation. The opinion of relevant societal stakeholders is today not sufficiently integrated in the process, and this regulation will improve this representation of SMEs and societal stakeholders at both European and national level.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The third element concerns public procurement. You know that many information and communication technology standards ensuring interoperability are elaborated not by the European standardisation organisations but by global forums and consortiums, and these specifications do not then fit into our categories of standards to which public authorities may refer in their calls for tender.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation will provide an evaluation procedure, after which public authorities will be able to use such ICT specifications in public procurement provided they comply with a set of criteria based on the World Trade Organisation principles for the standardisation process. The regulation also affirms the existing possibility for the Union to use service standardisation as a policy tool within harmonised service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many in Parliament, the Commission regrets the Council’s determination to impose bureaucratic comitology procedures on mandates which we think are both unjustified and will undermine the efficiency of the system due to their time-consuming nature. This is why we are going to make full use of the review clause inserted – thankfully – by Parliament to evaluate the impact of comitology on mandates, with a view to making possible new proposals within two years. Nevertheless, given that most of the key elements of the original proposal have been accepted, and in a spirit of compromise and in order to facilitate a first-reading agreement, the Commission is willing to accept the text as agreed between Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also improve quality and facilitate the protection of consumer health and safety. However, technological developments are moving faster than the processes for defining standards, which creates market conflicts. When European standards are defined adequately and quickly, and I emphasise the word ‘quickly’, this creates a more civilised single market, reduces the costs of manufacturing and services, facilitates interoperability and consequently boosts competitiveness. It is very important to abolish barriers to the trading of goods and provision of services between Member States, and gives rise to the need for harmonisation. Standardisation is a process where national standardisation bodies must play a part, alongside the European body. Unfortunately, however, the national bodies are largely neglected in the Commission’s proposal, and there are no improved mechanisms which would generate adequate feedback between the EU centre and Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, at the end of this process, despite all the legitimate objections from Ms Reding, we will be able to say that, from Parliament’s point of view, a good result overall has been achieved with this measure, which is now in the hands of Commissioner Barnier in connection with the Single Market Act.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am also happy to tell you why I believe that we can congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Comi, on this result. First of all, we managed to achieve a situation where something that we have frequently demanded in the past – namely, that we need more regulations, which are directly applicable, rather than directives, which have to be transposed – could finally become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we managed – and this is, after all, also always important for a dossier adopted at first reading at the end of the trialogue – to strengthen Parliament’s rights. In the past, the situation was that the Council was the only institution that could block standardisation proposals. Under the proposal before you today, which we are debating and on which we will be voting tomorrow, Parliament, too, has the ability to block proposals on standardisation by means of a resolution of this House, where, for example, proposals were brought forward again to regulate crime prevention measures in the establishment of development plans in one form or another under standardisation law, something which gave rise to some criticism from the Member States a few years back.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to us, however, that this proposal for a regulation accommodates economic policy goals for the whole of Europe. For one thing, it ensures that harmonised standards must remain market-oriented. We believe it is very important that we have ensured greater involvement of special interest groups, but that, at the same time, these groups can only assist with the actual standardisation process. We also believe it is very important that we have ensured, through the introduction of a notification system for third parties, that standards must also prove themselves in society, be supervised by society, and be accepted by society. Through this proposal, we can ensure that stakeholders, including the authorities, have full access to the European standardisation process. We can also ensure – and this is very important to us across group lines – that small and medium-sized enterprises have full access here and that the European standardisation landscape takes account of their special interests. Unfortunately, that was not always the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, overall, it is true that this measure only consists of 12 key measures – levers – from the first Single Market Act. We must therefore avoid giving the impression that we have reached a milestone for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is one element, a building block of a strategy, that we absolutely need to consolidate in the Single Market Act II. I hope that we also gain the approval of the House for the Single Market Act II and all the measures that we will be adopting here in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes down to it, you could say that the EU’s standards and standardisation work are really one of the hidden successes of European cooperation. Without standardisation, our everyday lives would be much more difficult. It ensures, for example, that we can use our USB memory sticks in any PC we like. It also ensures that the thread on our light bulbs is standardised, so that we can buy any light fitting we like and still be sure of finding a bulb that fits.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also standards that are there generally to make the products on the European market safer, for everything from toys to house building, and there are standards that help to ensure that we can test our food and that the environment is protected. That is why it is also very important that we have been able to look at our legislation and have been able to revise the existing standardisation legislation at European level. We can thereby make it even easier to be a consumer, even safer to be a worker and, moreover, we can make it even easier to be a business that produces goods for the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight three things in the proposal that we have now negotiated which I think are good. First and foremost, it is essential that we have made the political mandate-giving process more transparent; that must be the case when we make political decisions on the mandates that are to be given. Secondly, it is also very important that we have secured broader participation in the standardisation work, and it was important to us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to ensure that consumers, workers, environmental organisations, etc. are involved to a greater extent in the decision making in respect of standards. That was very important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that it was also important for us to ensure that we did not create an almost open back door when it comes to giving political mandates in the area of services. We wanted to stick to the principle that the Member States retain their powers in all matters that relate to defining the fundamental principles of social conditions, social security, health systems, etc. The amendments that Parliament has managed to push through have ensured that we make no changes to the Member States’ powers in this area. You could say that we have achieved a win-win situation. Workers, consumers, environmental organisations and businesses will gain a lot from this revision of the legislation on standardisation, which will mean that we can produce standards more easily, better and more quickly. In reality, all that is left is to say congratulations. Congratulations to European businesses, congratulations to European consumers and congratulations to European workers on legislation that makes it safer to be a citizen in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Standards are an important and proven tool. They facilitate a common technical language, a common technical basis within Europe’s internal market, and they are a useful tool for promoting innovation and sustainable development. The European approach has proven itself and, in times of economic crises, existing tools should be carefully modernised without jeopardising their substance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in doing that with standardisation. We have bolstered the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises and important social groups, and thus improved the acceptance of standardisation, but without jeopardising its structure, which is based on the voluntary cooperation of the business sector, which also bears the main part of the costs. I take the view that the participation rights of small and medium-sized enterprises, consumer and environmental associations and the trade unions could have been even greater, but I accept the compromise in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have extended standardisation to the services sector. Industry-oriented services and the IT sector, in particular, represent a significant area for standardisation. At the same time, however, it was important not to jeopardise the professions, and their creative potential. Standardisation is also a cost factor in industries such as the craft industries. Standardisation should therefore only be rolled out where there is actually market relevance in it. A multi-stakeholder platform will ensure this, and will ensure that the relevant consultations take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, we thought it important that a clear separation should be maintained between standardisation and legislation. The signal from Parliament is clear: we do not want legislation by the back door. All in all, we have achieved a good compromise, and our group will be giving it our backing in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The speed at which standards are produced is now one of the decisive factors influencing market development.

It is therefore necessary to evaluate all of the consequences of the proposed changes on economic life in Europe very sensitively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission regulation lacks a reference to an elementary principle of international standardisation, which is the principle of national representation.

<p class="contents">In this world, and in a society that is undergoing rapid transformation, Europe needs a comprehensive, integrating, effective and up-to-date system of standardisation. This system should ensure the correct functioning of the internal market and improve the protection of consumers and their lives. It is also essential to protect the environment. In addition, more innovation and social inclusion is very important, as is interaction and communication between networks and systems, in particular, in the area of new information and communication technologies, as has already been stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Professor Monti states in his report entitled ‘A new strategy for the single market’, European standardisation is essential for the governance of the internal market, with emphasis on the need to revise the European standardisation process, maintaining the advantages of the current system and finding the right balance between the European and national dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, the report that we are discussing here today supports and defends these objectives, which are right and appropriate: to put an end to the slowness and fragmentation that currently exists and which leads to companies incurring transaction costs and higher unit costs; to strengthen the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in standardisation activities, in particular, at national level, as well as facilitating their access to those standards, while also strengthening the participation of parties that represent the interests of society, such as consumers, environmental groups, workers and people with disabilities, while maintaining financial support for European organisations that have been established to represent public interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that the adoption of this report will contribute to the revival of the European project, to European innovation, and to the strengthening and competitiveness of our companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This example alone shows how important standardisation is and the great extent to which it can make life easier for citizens. This is a very important issue that we have to debate here. We, in Parliament, have also succeeded in adding many improvements to the Commission’s text. I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and to our shadow rapporteur for their outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">There were, however, two points – to single out just a couple of topics, for time reasons – that were particularly close to our hearts. First of all, we had the support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – which was a very important point for us – and ensuring that standardisation is not only the realm of large companies, but also respects the needs of SMEs. In cases like this, the risk is, of course, always very large that the large companies will go ahead and implement and the small companies will have to catch up, which can be a cost-intensive exercise. We have also managed to ensure that the support and the funding in this area have been safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area that was important to us was the removal of a section of the services that have recently been incorporated into this process, in particular, the removal of services of common economic interest and those of major importance to the professions. In this area, standardisation could be very dangerous, as these are fields that depend on creativity and the flexibility of service providers, and these must be safeguarded. We have reached a satisfactory compromise in this regard, and one in favour of which we, as a group, feel able to vote. As I said, though, there was a lot of work to do and I hope that things will be somewhat easier from here on in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with the elaboration of standards, and even more so with the acceleration of standardisation. However, I would like to note that this process should by no means come at the cost of quality. I therefore think that we should primarily aim to speed up the process in terms of administration; measures in this regard should be implemented jointly by the standardisation bodies and the Commission, while, of course, maintaining a consensus-based approach and publicity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is much the Commission can do to further this end, for example, by accelerating the initial and closing work phases, including the signing of contracts, performance certification and the facilitation of payments. I agree with the rapporteur that we can and should build upon the existing system, as it offers several opportunities for development. I agree that the issue of access to standards should not be confined to addressing the prices of standards, and I welcome the fact that we issued a call to the national standardisation bodies. This call concerns the reduction of costs through the application of special rates, for example, by providing bundles of standards at reduced prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the involvement of SMEs and other interest representatives in the standardisation process to be extremely important and worth supporting. As an aside, I would like to point out that there have been no substantial obstacles to their participation in the past. I believe that their passivity is due to other reasons, for example, their very limited financial resources, and I find that sometimes, their special expertise is also lacking. I am therefore of the opinion that when supporting them, we should focus primarily on these areas and aim at finding ways to boost their motivation. All things considered, the rapporteur managed to draft a report that can support European competitiveness, innovation and sustainable development at the same time. In the light of all this, and also on the basis of the rapporteur’s excellent work, I recommend the adoption of the report, and support it myself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has already been said about the benefits of standards. I would like to mention two further examples that we think are self-evident: the universal charger for mobile phones and, in future, the realisation of electromobility. Without standards, these things would absolutely not be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, not all of society knows how standards are produced. It is not this House – and nor will it be in future – it is national, European and international institutes like CEN and CENELEC that produce standards. The last 25 years has been a good period, but there were also a number of shortcomings, which we have now tidied up. The creation of standards was far too slow, far too expensive, too opaque and too unilateral in terms of participation. We have now rectified that with this proposal, and we will make access cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises, too, we will involve the trade unions and the social partners, the consumer organisations, and we will link up with national, international and European bodies. I am also pleased about the sensible involvement in procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I will deal with acceptance. This is something that we will still have to test out and check the state thereof. Germany’s DIN institute had serious concerns at the start of the debate about the direction that acceptance was moving in. I believe those concerns have since been resolved. The SME sector in Hesse, for example, has already provided me with feedback. I found out that it is pleased with this compromise, with this proposal from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and that it sees a series of improvements for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth recording tonight – and I am sure the Commissioner would want to mark this – that this is actually the first piece of the major legislative commitments in the Single Market Act that has been put through, and we vote on it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to record the fact – given the importance of this whole topic and the intense interest among the thousands of people around the European Union who are engaged in the standardisation process – that we took a decision with the wisdom of all the coordinators involved to do an important preparatory piece of work on this, which was led by my colleague, Mr Kožušník, who spoke earlier. We drew up a strategic report on standards some 18 months ago, which shaped our view on the topic, and enabled us to consult before we got the legislation before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that has really contributed to the quality of the work, and it is something that I know many of the other committees are looking at. I am delighted that my colleagues from the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are here this evening, which I am sure reflects the importance and interest that they attach to the whole of this standardisation dossier.</p>

I had some traffic problems and I had to drive a couple of hundred kilometres to get here to Brussels. Unfortunately, as yet, we have no European standard for traffic. I would very much like to thank Ms Comi for her cooperation. As Mr Harbour said, cooperation was excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that standardisation is good for industry, for our economy and, ultimately, for the consumer. As Europe, we are in a better position to establish a world standard, which will make this continent really count as an economic power in the world. Therefore, it is good that we are making standardisation easier with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this will be on a voluntary basis and that it can work. Indeed, a few years ago, together with Commissioner Verheugen, I set up a plan to standardise the plugs for phone chargers and, in 2014, the plugs for iPad chargers. In general, this standard will make it easier for industry to bring new products to market and it will also create a lot of consumer satisfaction. Once again, Ms Comi, thank you for your hard work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the latter question, from Mr Manders, there is a voluntary agreement between the European Union and industry for harmonisation of chargers, and this will be of very great importance for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">There was another question on service standardisation, and I would like to tell the honourable Member that the regulation reaffirms the possibility for the Union to use service standardisation as a policy tool within harmonised service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I could not agree more with what Mr Harbour said. This is indeed the first of 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence in the Single Market Act adopted by the Commission in April 2011. This is good for industry, for consumers, and for the economy at large, but it is also – and I think many Members have underlined this – an evolution, not a revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">So the regulation builds on the main pillars of the current, successful system, and the improvement it brings will provide Europe with a single, transparent and comprehensive instrument which will not only support the implementation of policies here in Europe, but will also help promote the competitiveness of European enterprises throughout the world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sophie Auconie, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this text is important because its two objectives are, on the one hand, the progressive and harmonious development of the electronic identification of bovine animals, with a five-year review clause for a possible transition to mandatory electronic identification and, on the other hand, the simplification of administrative procedures regarding the addition of voluntary indications that may be put on beef labels.</p>
<p class="contents">My reason for bringing this matter up in plenary is to correct inconsistencies attributable to the Commission services which arose when the vote was taken in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI).</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, after consulting a number of parliamentary experts, I propose, today, the adoption of three amendments, the sole objective of which is to correct these inconsistencies and clarify the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 45 and 47 are therefore simple technical corrections. Amendment 46 proposes that the simplification of the voluntary labelling procedure should not enter into force until 1 January 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that these voluntary indications must be objective, verifiable by the relevant authorities, and comprehensible to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid any unfounded fear, I have also specified once again that the relevant authority should verify the truth of these indications and ensure that the sanctions referred to in Article 22(4a) are applied. We are talking here about voluntary indications and not mandatory indications relating to the origin of the meat. We are therefore talking about commercial information used by operators, the rules for which need to be simplified. Clearly, we are all in agreement on the need to move towards the electronic identification of bovine animals. We are not advocating forcing the agricultural sector to implement electronic identification immediately. I am a legislator and I believe that we are responsible for the laws we adopt which have an economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The meat industry in Europe and the beef industry in particular are suffering at present and we, as legislators, cannot subject them to even more expenditure. This is not a public health problem. The idea is to put in place electronic identification to ensure better traceability of bovine animals, which the sector will adopt over time. We will see in five years’ time whether, in fact, the technology is sound and whether or not the industries are ready. Perhaps the economic climate will be better.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second part, the labelling of bovine animals, what are we talking about? We are not talking about questioning voluntary labelling: we are not doing away with it, just to be clear. We are talking about simplifying the system and simplifying the procedure. I will explain it very simply: meat labelling is carried out in the same way for all meat. For the beef industry, for beef, mad cow disease has made the procedure more complex. Let us keep the voluntary system, but let us simplify it, because we are responsible for the administrative burden that is characteristic of our procedures in Europe. We must do everything in our power to simplify them for our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express particular thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Auconie, for her commitment to this cause. I hope that her dedicated work will pave the way for an agreement to be reached at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be particularly welcome because the proposed new rules amount to an opportunity to enhance growth and competitiveness for many stakeholders. We all recognise that the current system of traceability is effective in terms of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic identification will, however, make the system more accurate and faster. It will improve the tracing of animals and food products for enhanced food safety and better management of disease outbreaks. It will also reduce administrative burdens by simplifying the current procedures. Modern technology is literally just a click away for European farmers, and our duty is to adopt legislation to allow them to embrace and profit from this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards voluntary beef labelling, horizontal EU legislation has already been developed. This legislation covers beef in the same way as any other meat. There is, therefore, no need to maintain a specific authorisation procedure for voluntary beef labels. Operators respecting the existing horizontal provisions would, of course, be free to provide additional information on their labels. Any such information should not mislead consumers and should be verifiable by the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also keep in mind that current rules on bovine identification and voluntary beef labelling were described as ‘burdens’ imposed on business in the communication from the Commission on the action programme for reducing administrative burdens in the EU. There has been much talk about reducing these burdens, and now we are acting on it.</p>

He will be here with us imminently, so I would like to thank you and your services for allowing me to speak now, but I am delivering the speech I was going to make later on in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a contribution to this debate because of my recent experience with EID on sheep, and I am going to confine my remarks to how that system works technically.</p>
<p class="contents">This system has been imposed on farmers in my constituency, despite strong opposition, and has now been around long enough for us to know that it does not work efficiently. That is not to say that some farmers do not find it useful. They do – particularly for internal flock management – but it is not sufficiently reliable to be used as a primary system for stock movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The unreliability of the technology has been acknowledged by the Commission through their granting of more time, for example, to the UK to bed the system in. Why would we want to embark on an extension of this system to bovines before we get these things sorted? And why would we want to extend it at all – and I mean here specifically on a mandatory basis – unless we are clear that there are benefits to be gained?</p>
<p class="contents">I frequently meet farmers who are terrified by the prospect of failing to achieve cross-compliance and thereby suffering the punitive withdrawal of their single farm payments. Our job is to make regulations that help both farmers and the authorities to work smarter. Let us take the opportunity to do that when we vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Food safety is certainly an issue that we must do everything we can to address. We definitely do not want to see the kind of situation that existed in the 1990s in connection with the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential factor in the traceability of the entire food chain is the identification of bovine animals. Every animal on every holding must be registered. Identification and traceability, however, must also constantly be improved. Electronic identifiers are not acknowledged in current EU legislation: instead, there have to be two ear tags serving as the identifier. I myself have received a lot of feedback from producers on the present ear tag system, so there is certainly much room for improvement in that area. Technology has developed, and we should recognise electronic identifiers as an official means of identifying animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken an important step in this respect, and I am pleased with its proposal and with the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, inasmuch as cautious progress is now being made. Electronic identifiers are recognised under the law, but their use is not being made compulsory. Instead, holdings are being allowed to switch to these systems in their own good time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that it is necessary to develop a voluntary system for beef and beef products. There have been shortcomings with the voluntary labelling system, and practices have differed widely among the various Member States. Some have not adopted the system at all, so, for this reason, the system needs to be clarified, so that consumers are sure that they are getting accurate information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the question of labelling, the great concern of everyone concerned with animal welfare is that all meat originating from animals suffering ritual slaughter should be labelled: consumers have the right to know and to reject it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to the voluntary information, a system has developed – which has also led to competition in the marketplace – such that I would not like to do without this information. I therefore believe it would be a mistake for the Commission to remove this voluntary information.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we need to mention cutting red tape. The rapporteur put forward a proposal for how we can integrate this into the proposed food information regulation. Article 7 prohibits misleading statements and the like. I would like to ask the Commission whether it is possible for us to introduce monitoring via this food information regulation that could operate that precisely? Would it, instead, be better to leave this up to the Member States? This is an absolutely crucial point. The voluntary information must be retained; it represents an important part of the consumer system.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the marking of the animals, I would have liked to have seen a little bit more courage. If the conclusion is that the electronic system does not work, there is then no need to introduce it; it should be removed from the legislation straight away, and it should be left up to the technicians to see what they make of it then. However, having the two systems in parallel in the internal market is something that I view as way off the mark. Things cannot work like that. We need a system for trade and commerce and, in my view, that can only be an electronic system. If the farmers complain that they are punished in cross-compliance if an ear tag falls out, that is much worse. The electronic tags never fall out – they are inside the animals. They therefore provide much greater certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured.</p>
<p class="contents">As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have stood before this Parliament many times to decry sheep EID. I hope the Commission has learned from their incompetent handling of electronic ID tags in the past, with which there are still many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that, if the scheme is introduced, it must be on a voluntary basis and is not, as some Members of this Parliament urge, subject to a report in five years to consider compulsory EID of bovine animals. The UK cattle ID system works perfectly well, so the choice to upgrade should be an individual decision based on working preferences. It should be made without fear of penalty under cross-compliance if equipment is subject to error.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep tagging brought a host of problems that persecuted British farmers whose equipment was especially vulnerable to the elements. Cattle in the UK are often out to grass for at least six months, so tag loss is inevitable. There is a crisis in the dairy industry in the UK, while the beef market is only just seeing a small recovery after years of being in the red. Both are subject to pressures from rising feed cost and cheaper foreign imports. If the Commission makes a shambles of bovine tagging, the industry will be brought to its knees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumer information should be clear and objective, and the result of a simple, unbureaucratic process. The labelling of beef is clearly important and should prevent the proliferation of erroneous information given to consumers about sensitive issues such as the breed of the animals and the way in which they were created, as well as the way in which the meat is processed. The regulation of information given to the consumer must address these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Beef is an extremely sensitive product in relation to the EU market, and it is highly subject to pressure from third countries, which have less stringent requirements in terms of animal well-being and systems of production. The same provisions must apply to imported products.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the labelling system should be improved, but with concrete rules and a clear and fair monitoring system for all of the Member States. This should be done within an EU system that is able to prevent different levels of performance, which supports distortions in competitiveness. I also consider that this system should be made obligatory for all of the Member States, similar to the current system for poultry meat and eggs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the differing views held, it was no easy job in committee, and it is certainly no secret that there were different focuses even within the group. This is, however, a good basis for the negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, it is important that consumer protection has top priority. We have learnt the lessons of the BSE crisis. At the same time, however, we have made it clear to our farmers that we need to pay closer attention, when it comes to imports, too, to ensuring that rules that we put in place together are also complied with. We do not want any unnecessary bureaucracy. The trick now lies in finding out the point at which we have the maximum possible level of consumer protection without causing unnecessary bureaucracy. After intensive discussions within the group, we therefore introduced another refinement of Article 1 point 14 that envisages that the information that has thus far fallen within the scope of voluntary labelling under this system could soon be covered by food labelling rules. However, we also want to see that monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schnellhardt asked the Commission the right question, namely, how can we ensure that there will be no deception of consumers? Our point of view is that the competent authorities must monitor this and that penalties must also be imposed in the event of violations. After the vote tomorrow, we will be entering into negotiations with the Council. All sides will have to be flexible so that we can achieve our common goal. Perhaps there will also still be new insights during the negotiations with the Council that we could then also allow to flow through into the final result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that we cannot make compromises in terms of food safety, yet neither must we adopt measures in its name which will affect the most vulnerable food producers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the compulsory electronic identification of cattle, this cost must not be supported by small farmers. I believe that for them in particular, the electronic identification of animals should be optional. This type of farmer must enjoy protection and support, particularly at a time when, in most cases, they produce the healthiest food without the environmental impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support the introduction of electronic identification for bovine animals on a voluntary basis because this is the best way forward at this time. Maybe at some time in the future, we can return and revisit this, but at this time, this is the way we should go, and not on a mandatory basis, as some have suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour, however, of the principle of EID for cattle because it could be a good thing in the long term. We did see the problems we faced when it was mandatory in the sheep sector, which is still leaving many sheep farmers with massive problems, especially in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and I am sure in other countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This was not perfected so I certainly look forward to it improving with cattle. We have to adopt the right technology to compete with those outside the European Union if we are going to be competitive in the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In theory, this should lessen the administrative burden on farmers and managing authorities. Member States should have the flexibility to decide the system which best suits their own farmers, livestock markets and processors. In the United Kingdom, the majority of farmers do not use electronic management systems, and it would be unfair to make EID compulsory, given the impact on farmers but also the lack of tangible benefits for the consumer and taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep EID has proved to be nothing short of more unnecessary bureaucracy from the Commission. A 100% accuracy rate has not been possible, given the failings in technology, and unless the Commission takes a more pragmatic view here, farmers in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe will be unduly penalised under cross-compliance rules. It is important, therefore, that the Commission tackle the problems within the sheep sector before imposing other unnecessary rules on beef and dairy.</p>
<p class="contents">As we move forward, we must have an approach that allows for flexibility, does not prove bureaucratic for farmers and processors, improves competitiveness in the market and gives consumers valuable information to make informed choices. This is a huge task indeed for negotiation with Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, input costs have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. In an environment of rising rents for forage land, rising feed and fuel prices and other similar developments, official regulations, including where they would be welcome in principle – for environmental protection reasons or for consumer confidence and food safety – will tip small farmers in particular over the edge, right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, the European Union has, in my view, drawn the right conclusions from the consultation, namely, that compulsory electronic identification would have entailed economic disadvantages for some farmers, and that is something that we do not want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission considers that its proposal would be beneficial for animal health, public health and food safety, and that it would reduce the administrative burden in bovine farming and the related meat sector. Let me remind you that it was this Parliament that adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to reduce administrative burdens, and it was endorsed by this entire House.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific problems, there is no need to maintain a specific authorisation procedure for voluntary beef labelling as horizontal provisions on labelling of meat would apply. It is also important to note that voluntary beef labelling contains information related to quality and not necessarily to health. Health and traceability are ensured by mandatory beef labelling and not by voluntary beef labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it would be very important that Parliament gives its agreement, so that it can start with the necessary negotiations, and that this will result in the development of electronic identification through use in practice by those who want to take it up.

I would like to say to you just how important public health, the health of our citizens, of European citizens is to me. There is absolutely no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Identification of bovine animals exists. It is not electronic, but it exists. It allows for very high-quality traceability. That is not the issue at all. It is simply that, as Mr Bufton, Ms Reimers and Ms Girling have said, the technology for the electronic identification of bovine animals does not appear to be totally reliable. Therefore, let us wait until we can be sure that the system for the electronic identification of bovine animals is reliable before we decide to make it mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in reaching my compromises, I accepted without any difficulty that we would consider reviewing the issue in five years’ time to see whether the technology had progressed and was able to guarantee high-quality electronic identification.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is also economic. I do not think that I am putting the health of European citizens at risk when I say that we must leave our agricultural sector and the beef industry sufficient time to adopt this new technology naturally. For farmers, there is a cost: an electronic chip costs EUR 1 for each animal in a herd. In addition to that, however, there is the whole system of automated reading and so on, which is very costly, and I would remind you that our farmers are suffering from the recession and a lack of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say to Ms Bizzotto, for example, that I am not doing away with and do not wish to do away with voluntary labelling, not at all. As the Commissioner has said, it is not a question of doing away with voluntary labelling but of simplifying the system and the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">All aspects of the public health of our citizens are indicated in mandatory labelling. There is absolutely no question of abandoning labelling information.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in response to one of my fellow Members, I would like to reaffirm that there will not be a legal loophole in relation to labelling. We must ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers. This is the horizontal legislation you spoke about, Commissioner, which concerns all types of meat. Beef will therefore be treated in the same way as all other types of meat. Furthermore, all the compromise amendments submitted to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) have been adopted. I therefore call on my fellow Members to take my lead in tomorrow’s vote and I should like to thank them most sincerely in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to clarify that we are still aiming for an agreement at first reading. This means that tomorrow, under Article 57 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I will ask for the final vote on the resolution to be postponed. I propose that we then move directly to the trialogue, and that we subsequently reconvene in plenary to put the result of the negotiation at first reading to the vote in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The identification system is a matter of serious concern for European farmers. The Commission is well aware that there were significant problems, which caused terrible difficulties for farmers, with the mandatory system for electronic identification (EID) of sheep. Many farmers have contacted me because of illness, strain, injury or infection among their sheep as a result of the identification technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Faulty technology and a lack of realism and flexibility on the part of the authorities have led to fines being imposed on farmers and a pointless increase in bureaucracy. The electronic identification of animals ought to be an optional scheme and one run by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there is no advantage in having a compulsory scheme. In an optional scheme, small farmers – who would benefit little from the scheme – would not be obliged to implement electronic identification and would not have to shoulder unfair administrative and financial burdens. In an optional scheme, only those farmers who would derive immediate, significant benefit from the EID would implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European legislation is committed to ensuring them the highest level of protection by means of measures adapted to the changeable requirements of the market. Although I agree with the Commission’s overall objective of achieving more clarity in the application of the legislation on the identification and traceability of bovine animals, I strongly disagree with the proposal to delete the provisions on voluntary labelling of beef, apparently justified by the heavy administrative burden that is not offset by sufficient advantages. Given that it seems to be a contradiction in terms to delete a provision that is, in itself, ‘voluntary’, if this proposal were to be approved, it would create a legal black hole as regards voluntary labelling which, instead, proves to be valuable because it provides useful information that helps both to increase the information available to consumers and the value-added of the products. The best way to market their products is a determining factor for farmers and approval by the competent authority guarantees that the information featured on the labels is reliable. In the absence of such approval, consumers cannot rely on the labelling of the product. For the above reasons, I support keeping the present system of voluntary beef labelling in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reasons in terms of costs that have led to the proposal to simplify the system of beef labelling seem to be understandable. Nevertheless, they are disproportionate in terms of the losses or rather the harm that it would cause, above all, in terms of quality, transparency and protection as regards consumers. In any case, I hope that it is clear to everyone that the proposal to abolish the voluntary labelling system would prejudice the competitiveness of the product. In my country, Italy, breeders always invest in quality, traceability and food safety, and, in voluntary labelling, they have found a useful means of improving information and adding to the value of products for sale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

<p class="contents">All these key players are categorical and all the elements, that is to say, the research carried out by the Council of Europe, the special UN rapporteurs, the Red Cross, national and international human rights organisations, investigative journalists, the testimony of the victims, of their lawyers and of CIA agents, concur: the Member States have to answer for their active or passive complicity in crimes of torture, secret detention and enforced disappearance.</p>
<p class="contents">For nine months, I was able to see the patently obvious limitations of the investigative steps taken by the Member States and their stubborn determination to conceal the truth: lack of political will, prevalence of national interests, narrow remits for investigations, abuse of state secrecy, lack of transparency, restriction of the rights of victims and of their lawyers. The imagination of national authorities knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">In putting this report to the vote, Parliament aims to take a decisive step towards putting an end to the denial of reality, and hence of justice, which has characterised the strategy of the EU Member States for 11 years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its recommendations to the Member States, the Council and the Commission, the report expresses a simple and clear will: every effort must be made to ensure that rigorous, independent and transparent investigations, capable of determining responsibilities and obtaining justice for the victims, are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Member States owe it, first and foremost, to the victims, but they also owe it to Europe’s citizens, who are entitled to demand from our institutions, from their institutions, respect for democratic values and the rule of law on which they are based. To be effective, we had to be concrete and specific and to stay abreast of the issue so that we could identify the best levers to help justice move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore chose to focus on the issue of secret prisons on EU territory. Thanks to the excellent cooperation of Eurocontrol, which I thank, and to the visits and meetings of the Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) (rapporteur, shadow rapporteurs), today there are grounds for the report to adopt recommendations of relevance to Poland, Lithuania and Romania in particular. These three countries are now before the European Court of Human Rights facing allegations of torture, secret detention and failure to investigate effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur is convinced, more than ever, that only a coordinated European approach aimed at supporting Member States can break the code of silence.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for the Council is to take the matter in hand officially and to put it on its work agenda, to acknowledge its responsibility and, finally, to apologise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, while having taken note of the facts, has still not mobilised all its justice and human rights resources and instruments to ensure that Member States comply with their fundamental obligations. It must take initiatives to uphold the principle of mutual assistance and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, the report invites us, you, the Council, the victims and all those who seek the truth to return to this House in a year’s time.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen resident in Germany who had been detained without trial for five years at Guantánamo, again came to Parliament to speak about his ordeal, still very current, and to seek justice for the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding, if Mr Kurnaz has the strength to come back in a year’s time, will we be able to tell him that facts have been established, that responsibilities have been acknowledged, and that we can, finally, apologise to him on behalf of the European Union?</p>

It is a very delicate matter, but it is also one that concerns values we hold dear. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has constantly repeated that the practices which are referred to as renditions constitute a serious violation of several fundamental rights: unlawful arrest, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. The fight against terrorism cannot justify such unacceptable practices. The full respect of human rights is not negotiable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always stressed that it is up to the Member States concerned not only to commence but also to continue in-depth, independent and impartial investigations to establish the truth. This is a positive obligation deriving from the European Convention on Human Rights in order to establish responsibilities and enable the victims to obtain compensation for such damage. That is also why you have quoted the Court, which is putting these questions on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2005, when the allegations were first raised, the Commission has been in contact with those Member States that were said to have hosted secret detention sites. As regards aviation policy, the Commission drew the necessary conclusions in the context of its communication on civil and business aviation of January 2008, and new rules on the procedures applicable to flight plans for the Single European Sky entered into force on 1 January 2009. They provide an additional means of monitoring the actual movement of aircraft, and I have heard with great interest that the contacts with the institution on this subject are very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also refers to the necessity of reinforcing the human rights compliance of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. On this subject, the Commission is determined to ensure that Member States actually do so when they apply the EU instruments for judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that Member States comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights when they implement those instruments. As I have often said before this Parliament, it is when European law is applied that the Charter automatically applies, so in these cases, the Charter does apply. This concerns not only the internal aspects of judicial cooperation but also its external aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Commission underlines the importance of the entry into force on 1 February 2010 of the two EU-USA agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance. Both clarify and unify the legal framework of judicial cooperation in criminal matters with the USA, and they clearly refer to the need to fully respect fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the national and institutional deficiencies underlined by the report, let me recall that the current treaties do not empower the European Union to establish a general mechanism addressing human rights violations. However, I can assure you that the Commission is vigilant in ensuring that the Charter applies within the scope of EU law, as I explained on the question of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the oversight of intelligence and security services, you are well aware that this is a very sensitive area which comes under the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission has repeatedly recalled that cooperation between the intelligence services must not in any way go against or overrule the relevant EU instruments in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. No cooperation between intelligence services can undermine the full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. I think Parliament is in agreement with me that the only way to fight efficiently against terrorism is to apply our basic rules on which the European Union has built its very being.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to cooperate actively with Parliament to ensure that what happened within the framework of the so-called CIA rendition programme will never occur again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Delays and deliberate obstructions to independent and transparent national inquiries are an affront to liberty and justice. It is a travesty to claim state secrecy in order to perpetuate impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, without being obstructed by the niceties, must have the guts and self-respect to enforce accountability for its own Members’ involvement in human rights abuses. We have just appointed our first human rights chief in Stavros Lambrinidis, but the EU’s credibility in urging respect for fundamental rights throughout the world is badly undermined by the justified suspicion that some of our Member States rode roughshod over international law and civil liberties, so we must clean house in order to advocate and promote the values that we espouse in our external partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not only principled but necessary. Look at the situation in Libya. People allegedly subject to rendition and torture with the collusion of Western governments and intelligence services are now senior in the post-Gaddafi administration. Tony Blair has a hell of a lot to answer for. So, of course, does George Bush, the instigator, with his advisers, of the dismal decade of Guantánamo legal black holes and torture.</p>
<p class="contents">The Democrat presidents have not sufficiently respected the law either. President Obama has disappointed in his failure to close Guantánamo or shine a light on the past, and in his persistence with unfair military commissions, which could impose the death penalty, as well as his practice of assassinations by drone strikes.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe the truth will eventually out, even if it takes decades, but justice delayed is justice denied. The Council and Commission must join Parliament in forcing some light to be shed on this terrible period, for example, by supporting the UN special rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is an area in which the rule of law must prevail and human rights must be protected, defended and respected. These are the values that motivate my commitment and to which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is politically and firmly committed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, tomorrow, at a time when we will be commemorating the 11th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center, it is more necessary than ever to recall that Europe is still living under the threat posed by terrorist groups. This tragic date reminds us that we cannot let up in our efforts to ensure the security of 500 million European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that freedom and security must be the two pillars on which our anti-terrorist policies must be based. In this regard, I should like to remind you that effective measures to counter terrorism and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, secret detentions without charge or trial are contrary to our values and, in future, it must quite simply be impossible for them to take place on EU territory. No one shall be deprived of access to justice or of the right to a fair trial, and all citizens must be guaranteed the right to due process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our work has not been easy. Member States have been reluctant to disclose information under the mantle of state secrecy.

<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Commission to support and monitor national procedures for the establishment of the responsibility of Member States. That is the only way we will be able to restore our reputation as the guardian and defender of universal human rights standards and that is the only way we will be able to demand, with a straight face, that candidate countries and neighbouring countries respect high standards of protection of human rights and the democratic legal order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apparently, it has no interest in cases of human rights violations that took part partly in its name.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. It is, unfortunately, not the first time and probably also not the last time we will be debating this. The Member States are in denial, and if I listen to my esteemed PPE colleague, the PPE Group is also in denial.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened cannot be justified. If the same acts had been committed by other countries – for example, Arab countries – we would have a full room here; the Council would be here and we would be very quick to condemn those actions. But because they have been committed with the support of European countries, we do not feel that we have to answer to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have lost moral authority and credibility, and I think there is a bitter irony in the fact that we help to unseat dictators like Gaddafi, like Mubarak, like Mr Assad (who is still there) who, not so long ago, were our allies in shipping people to those same countries – to the country of Mr Assad – because he and his friends are so very good at torturing and getting us the information that we want. It is an absolute disgrace that the governments of Europe still refuse to answer, to tell people about their responsibility, and to offer their apologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, this is not about one country or another: we have here a collective responsibility. This is not about Romania or Lithuania or any other European country; it is about a community of values, and we have a duty – we as the European Parliament – we will not forget. We will keep raising this issue until people have been held to account over human rights violations that were committed in our name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking back, we can only be thrilled with this new report and so, on behalf of our group, I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Flautre, as this follow-up report finally sees the light of day.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time of the Fava report, members were still struggling to discover hard facts due to the lack of information on the covert CIA detention programme. Based on a number of specific indicators, for me, the strength of the report was found mainly in the formulation of a number of recommendations, such as the drafting of a comprehensive definition of terrorism and imposing adequate democratic control of intelligence services. The purpose of those recommendations was to ensure that illegal practices such as forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions do not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what do we find five years on? Those recommendations have remained dead in the water and no single European country has provided an explanation why. The European Union and its Member States are continuing to feign deafness in response to the many calls for openness about their involvement in the CIA programme, despite all the evidence gathered by Parliament itself, as well as by the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the media and organisations such as Amnesty International.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this report, I certainly hope that Parliament will continue to exert pressure until we finally get some clarification and all the recommendations have been implemented. This is absolutely necessary because arbitrary detention continues to be a practice of the United States in particular. In addition, Guantánamo has still not been closed down, despite all the promises. Of course, combating terrorism is necessary, but the balance between the protection of society and violations of personal freedoms should be appropriate. Respect for human rights is an absolute precondition for ensuring the effectiveness of any anti-terrorism policy, and hence also the European anti-terrorism policy, especially in order to maintain the confidence of citizens in the democratic order of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">By cooperating with the CIA programme without criticism, the EU has grossly violated this confidence. The use of unconditional diplomatic assurances, the systematic invocation of state secrecy and the way in which intelligence services took on the role of judge are contrary to the values on which Europe is built, namely, the rule of law, human rights and respect for human dignity. My group has therefore worked hard for a strong text which condemns these practices. It is only in this way that Europe can maintain moral control in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The allegations of some Member States’ involvement must be treated with nothing but the fullest seriousness and thoroughness that it warrants. As a lawyer, a democrat and a former interior minister, I believe that any such investigations must be through an established process, and that process is for fully independent, judicial inquiries to be held and investigated at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">These inquiries are already under way in those countries that have been named in connection with these matters. Public confidence is being eroded in the very services that are here to protect us, and until we have an opportunity to draw a line under the accusations and provide real proof one way or the other, reports such as this are actually feeding terrorists and extremist propaganda. My own country, the United Kingdom, is one of the countries at whom these allegations are being levelled, a country that has long-established principles of freedom, fairness and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the opportunity of an investigation in order to reinstate the reputation of our security services, currently tarnished with allegations of our alleged involvement. Other Member States are also put in the dock, accused but not convicted. Is that fair? Of course, it is important to move forward in a way that encourages cooperation and a good working method in finding a resolution. Unfortunately, I do not think that the content of this report, its language or its approach helps us achieve either of these things.</p>

<p class="contents">As the press and the NGOs have stressed a great many times, the secret operations carried out by the CIA in the aftermath of the 11 September attack involved approximately 60 countries around the world, including at least 10 EU Member States. Abduction, detention without trial, disappearance and torture kept pace with the transportation of alleged suspects, in particular, to Guantánamo, yet to be closed. Human rights violations reached an all-time high.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States concerned did, and some are still doing, their utmost to prevent the sad truth from getting out. I would, therefore, like to extend my warmest and most sincere thanks to our rapporteurs, in particular, to Ms Flautre, for pressing on with this marvellous work on our behalf despite the pressure exerted by a number of Member States and their representatives here in this House. I shall not mention any names, but they know who they are.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just say that it is never acceptable to change one’s perspective depending on whether or not one feels close to a government. Human rights violations are always intolerable, particularly when they are committed by EU Member States that want to give lessons in this area to the whole world. No state, whether it is the United States of America, or whether it is an EU Member State, can shirk its responsibilities, including when it is combating terrorism. Yes, the credibility of the European Union is at stake. Yes, we are collectively responsible towards EU citizens. Move forward, then! Let us move forward. Indeed, the Union must start by cleaning up its own backyard. The sooner the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights, as is generally known, are those rights, the respect of which all potential candidate states for EU accession must commit to, through the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) for instance, as we all know.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these facts, it is scandalous that all the necessary steps resulting from the illegal transport of prisoners and the CIA’s secret prisons on European soil, in some cases not only with the knowledge, but even with the aiding and abetting of national governments, have still not been put in place. As if this violation of the ECHR were not shameful enough on its own, the investigations continue to drag on, with no end in sight. It is high time that action was finally taken and closure given to these disreputable events.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to talk about human rights now, however, it needs to be clear that, specifically in respect of the ongoing accession negotiations with Turkey, the EU can no longer turn a blind eye to the fact that human rights in that country largely exist only on paper. The incompatibility with the Copenhagen criteria alone should, in my opinion, be enough to stop the accession talks and instead launch talks on a privileged partnership. If the European Union is serious about human rights, it needs to finally repeal historical unlawful legislation such as the regulations of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People’s Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) in Slovenia and the Beneš decrees in the Czech Republic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not agree more, just as I can only agree with what you said in your speech today, when you spoke about the values of the rule of law, the presumption of innocence, and the right to a fair trial before an independent tribunal. All of this has been denied to those detained in Guantánamo, the closure of which has been promised, but has not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">We would draw attention to the importance of international law and the need for the uncompromising defence of human rights. In the report we adopted on 14 February 2007, following the committee which I chaired, we evaluated the facts, identified misconduct, pointed out omissions and proposed more than 40 recommendations aimed at preventing the same things from happening again, or at least preventing them from happening with such ease.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that must be asked today is: what will happen if the same things happen again now? What measures have we actually taken to ensure that history will not repeat itself? As I see it, in essence, nothing has been done. There is certainly greater public opinion on this matter, so that parliaments would not refrain from becoming more involved than they did in the past, while the judicial authorities in certain Member States would be more vigilant and would react more rapidly. However, most of the European institutions and the governments of the Member States have done nothing to comply with our recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the work of Ms Flautre and the excellent report that she has put before us. I agree with most of its recommendations and would like to emphasise that state secrets may be an exceptional form of defence used by democracies, but they cannot constitute a pretext for hiding the arbitration and violation of human rights. However, I would repeat the question: are we better placed today to assure our fellow citizens that the same thing cannot happen again, or at least that it cannot be repeated with impunity? I believe that we have to carry out rigorous work in close collaboration with the national parliaments in order to identify what is being done with regard to each of the recommendations that we adopted. I am even willing to accept that some of the recommendations may be difficult or controversial to apply, but I wish to understand why they have been overwhelmingly ignored by the governments of the Member States and the EU institutions up until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasise the trend towards abuse of state secrecy and national security, which is an obstacle to parliamentary and judicial scrutiny. Transparency on the part of the Member States and the EU institutions is, however, an essential condition for ensuring that public action fully retains its legitimacy and credibility in the fight against terrorism and cross-border crime, in complete respect of fundamental rights and human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that, while some countries have been named in particular, the European Union has a collective responsibility, and we are expecting the Council to take a clear position on proven facts instead of being satisfied with simple allegations of cases of human rights violations, which can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, must also assess the facts, taking account of the Treaties, and do everything it can to help shed light on this matter. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the many citizens who have mobilised around this report, the vote on which they are impatiently waiting for, to finally get things moving.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I hope that it will get the overwhelming support of the House tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does that mean that half of Europe’s countries – Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain and Poland – did that out of disrespect for the humanitarian achievements of international law or international standards of human rights? That would be an absurd conclusion. I think these countries were making very difficult decisions in very difficult times, when attacks were being made in New York, London and Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, mistakes were made, but it is highly hypocritical to accuse all those countries today – as I said, half of the EU’s Member States – without presenting an alternative method for dealing with the leaders of international terrorist movements in compliance with the law. The suggestion made in the report about giving those leaders all the legal privileges enjoyed by suspects in our own criminal procedure is hard to take seriously. Interestingly enough, President Obama used that argument three or four years ago to convince Americans to vote for him in national elections. However, the Guantánamo detention camp is still in operation today, and President Obama returned to using military tribunals just a few months ago to try people suspected of terrorism. Unfortunately, the European Parliament does not understand this and, for this reason, the report does not warrant endorsement.</p>

This situation more closely resembles one of a war than of a common crime, which is why all EU Member States have both a criminal procedure and a military procedure in place. I am not saying that those people should be treated as if they were prisoners of war. What I am saying is that the acts committed by those people do not resemble ordinary crimes. They are positioned somewhere between ordinary crime and warfare, which is why I assert that international law does not fully address the phenomenon of international terrorism and we are therefore dealing with a gap in legislation.</p>

This concept by NATO, a strategic partner organisation of the EU, has legitimised numerous violations of human rights, the evidence for which is recognised and documented in the report by Ms Flautre. These NATO partnerships are aimed wholly at destroying the framework of dialogue and peaceful coexistence that has been consolidated through the creation of the Charter of the United Nations since 1945.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider the overall content of this report to be positive as it can contribute to clarifying the imperialist policies of the US and its illegal methods, whether through the CIA or through NATO. However, we believe that it is for the national institutions of the Member States to make investigations, evaluate the evidence and judge the activities that have compromised political structures through acts that may be illegal. As for us in Portugal, we have done everything we can to open a political inquiry to ascertain governmental accountability for the passage of secret CIA flights through our country. Unfortunately, that process has been blocked by the national parties that belong to the majority in this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have also made a small contribution to the drafting of this report. I have followed closely the achievement of an objective and balanced final document, which highlights new elements that have emerged in the last five years, where applicable. At the same time, I advocated throughout the process that the report must not turn into an indictment against Member States and that the European Parliament must not substitute national or international inquiry mechanisms and, above all, must not render a verdict or establish guilt. With this in mind, I have submitted amendments within both the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I believe that they contributed to a more balanced reflection of the situation in Member States, including in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the final report makes reference to the parliamentary inquiry carried out in my country in 2008 and the conclusions that came out of it, since this inquiry was omitted from the initial draft, thereby generating a representation divorced from reality. At the same time, clarifications were required relating to the new elements that have emerged in recent years. For example, it was important to specify that certain information that appeared in the press was not confirmed by the inquiry or by the authorities. This is why I have supported the assertion that any requests for new inquiries must have a solid foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that light must be shed on the possible involvement of EU States in the transfer or illegal detention of prisoners by the CIA, and the presumption of innocence must be respected. The purpose of the process remains the discovery of the truth and not the establishment of guilt at all costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I experienced his wrath and the wrath of our interior minister at the time. I was practically laughed out of this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President, we ought to be proud of this flag, but I am afraid that in this instance, we cannot be. There are only two institutions that are represented here today: the Council’s seats are still empty, showing that there is a complete lack of recognition or commitment from our national governments. Had it been a third country that had these allegations levelled against it, I wonder what our response would have been.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in the United Kingdom, we have now taken a very different step of having our own internal investigations, rejecting what may have been done before, but that is not enough. When terrorists carry out actions, we are not weak by sticking to our principles. They cannot destroy us through their actions, but they can take away so much more from us through our reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">What I say to Mr Szymański when he makes the sort of national-sentiment comments that he makes and then leaves the Chamber is simply this: there is one non-EU country of which we can be proud and from which we can learn so much more, and that is Norway. When it faced the most terrible of criminal offences, including bombings and death, it did not react by taking away the rights of its citizens; it delivered every right and it delivered justice.

The involvement of a broad range of European states in a practice that flagrantly breaches the most basic democratic rights reveals this to be hollow rhetoric. These states are accomplices to state kidnapping, extrajudicial incarceration and torture. All of this is documented and known to the governments involved.</p>

I call for the use of Shannon airport by the US military to be ended immediately.

<p class="contents">The findings of independent journalists and investigators from Poland and Lithuania have confirmed the secret stopovers of US aircraft at military airfields in north-eastern Poland, and the subsequent escorting of the persons under transport from these aircraft to secret intelligence service facilities in Lithuania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely clear to all of us that such activities of the CIA in Poland, Lithuania or Romania could not have taken place without the knowledge and consent of official structures in these countries.

Furthermore, the propaganda value to terrorists of proven cases of ill-treatment is immense.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur knows, because she got all these letters, that the first letters of the Commission were issued in 2006 by my colleague, Franco Frattini, then by my colleague, Jacques Barrot, then by Ms Malmström and myself. We will continue to insist, along with the Member States, that the whole truth will be revealed. I will also meet Stavros Lambrinidis, the Human Rights Special Representative, in order to see how we can join forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the United States, the EU holds a regular dialogue with the US on human rights and counter-terrorism issues, and we have a dialogue with the US State Department legal adviser on all aspects of international law. In line with the Council guidelines on torture, the EU regularly raises issues concerning disappearances, secret detention and torture in its human rights dialogue with all relevant third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell this House that on the issue of the ratification of the UN Convention for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance, the EU Member States have submitted a joint pledge to the 31st ICRC conference to ratify this convention by 2015 and, of course, we will follow this very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been one question raised in this House: will the same occur again? I would like to answer very clearly: ‘no’ – because we speak up, because this House does not stop bringing pressure to bear, and because Europe is about equilibrium between the safety of our society, on the one hand, and the rights of the individual on the other. Because Europe is all about the rule of law, let us do everything to shed light on all that has happened in the past, so that the past does not repeat itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that a lot can be done in the Member States in a year. We are not, of course, prosecutors and we do not have to ‘provide definite proof’. We simply know – if I take the example of Romania – that an investigation has been carried out in the Senate. You have pointed it out; it has been mentioned. I am also aware that there have been numerous allegations. I know that Eurocontrol has found evidence of new flights connecting Romania to Lithuania. A case file, which is mentioned in the complaint against Romania lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, was drawn up by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, and submitted to the authorities. None of these elements forms part of the public findings of the investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is not about singling out individual countries for general opprobrium because colleagues have placed great emphasis – and it is, I hope, a strong aspect of this report – on our collective responsibility. What is, in fact, happening? The reality is that each country holds a fragment of the truth. As a result, each country must carry out its investigations to the best of its ability so as to be able to expose this system because it is, in fact, a system.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no intention of stigmatising this or that country. It is clear and evident – no one can deny it – that, in Romania, a new investigation, a judicial investigation, must be conducted, because the elements –which do not constitute proof; we are not prosecutors – are nevertheless important enough to warrant the reopening of an investigation. The report calls for nothing more, nothing less. The report asks Romania to conduct an investigation, and calls on the Commission, in fact, to show that each country holds a fragment of the truth and that the Commission, in particular, has the means, the power, the duty and the obligation to ensure that this fragment of truth enlightens other countries so that all EU citizens can be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">You can do a lot. The rule is noted: you are strict, and I congratulate you on your resoluteness and on your regular interventions on fundamental rights violations within the framework of the implementation of EU law. However, in flagrant cases of unexplained massive violations, the means must be found to be accountable for the violations committed. For example, as regards the issue of interest to us here, you can bring in prosecutors, you can pool, or help to pool, information. You can translate all useful documents. You can gather together information and make it available to the Member States to help them conduct these investigations. The letters you are going to send once again to each Member State – which I welcome – must contain all the new elements that have come to light, including the analyses carried out by <span class="italic">Reprieve</span> of the data provided by Eurocontrol.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we are expecting, that is to say, a lot of work in the next year for a meeting which, I very much hope, will be a resounding success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The losses are difficult to calculate. Sometimes, the fires are caused by criminal or careless acts, but favourable conditions for the fires are also caused by high temperatures and worsening drought.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, for example, 80% of the country is experiencing severe drought. The area that has been burnt in 2012 is already twice the average for the last ten years. The possibility of making an application to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism is important in order to relieve the misery caused, but it is also of vital importance to enhance the existing EU instruments and create others in order to minimise the occurrence of fires, and to control their spread and devastating effects. This can be done firstly by promoting a forestry policy that is appropriate for the geographic and climatic diversity of Europe, and secondly through mechanisms for combining forces and means of fighting fires, so as to enable rapid and robust action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Greece is at the end of its tether and the Troika appears to be ignoring some basic facts. The OECD calculated working times for all its member countries in its last report. Greece works longer hours than anyone else: 2 032 hours a year. Apart from that, however, the Troika is trying yet again to interfere in labour legislation; this worries me and not only in connection with Greece. I am worried because the Commission priorities again include a review of the Working Time Directive. I would remind the House that, when it tried to review that directive in the previous parliamentary term, the European Parliament stood its ground. I shall therefore close by quoting Commission President Barroso, who said: ‘It would be a mistake from all points of view to try to dismantle the welfare state and our social models and this is especially important for countries that are under programme’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was shocked to discover that an agency set up to manage the administration of the REACH directive will not be wound down at the end of its registration period. Instead, the Commission has given the agency new work in the field of biocides. My point is that agencies are created to deal with a specific area and, when they have completed their task, more work is created. This ‘jobs for the boys’ approach is weakening the value of agencies.</p>

Their debts require cuts in government expenditure or increases in taxation or both. Their recessions require reflationary measures, devaluations and withdrawal from the euro zone where applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately Keynesian reflation, whether by bank-created credit or quantitative easing money creation, tends to be inflationary, because the expansion of the money supply precedes – sometimes by years in the case of huge infrastructure projects – the increase in the quantity of goods and services. Furthermore, credit creation leads to an increase in sovereign debt. Expansion by quantitative easing would be debt-free, but it is still inclined to be inflationary.</p>
<p class="contents">One remedy might be to recruit the unemployed and under-utilised contractors on special contracts which would put them to work immediately, but for which full payment would be delayed until the large infrastructure projects had been completed. Increase in aggregate demand would then coincide with increase in GDP and not precede it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similar developments have taken place in Europe in the past: in 2006 in Spain, and in Germany, where a company called Göttinger Gruppe took 250 000 people for a ride. As parabanks currently represent half of all banking assets worldwide and continue to increase their market share in Europe, we expect national governments of Member States to introduce more stringent regulations and exercise supervision over these companies in order to prevent a similar occurrence happening again on a European scale. We expect constructive action during consultations conducted by the European Commission on legislation to regulate the banking system.</p>
<p class="contents">Without full and adequate information, and without guarantees provided to customers, such companies should not be allowed to operate in the European financial market.

I will present the detailed circumstances of the case in a separate letter, with a request for it to be examined by the competent authorities in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully advocate the protection of children from violence, but believe that should apply to any kind of violence, whether domestic violence in families or violence suffered as a result of the actions carried out by official authorities, since unwarranted removal of a child from his or her family and parents is one of the gravest forms of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Amsterdam states that the capacity of public service television should be maintained and increased. Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states that the freedom and pluralism of the media are to be respected. As for the Commission, the role of the public television services is crucial in order to ensure pluralism and the democratic process. In 2008, this very Parliament stated that having public stations alongside private stations was the basis of pluralism in the media throughout the EU, as a guarantee of effective independence from political pressure and market forces. I could go on!</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Government wants to throw all of this out of the window, putting an end to the public television service as part of a process that lacks transparency and was not voted for by a majority of the Portuguese public, but we will nevertheless prevent the government from doing so with the means at our disposal. We will do so here in Parliament, in the Commission, in the EU Court of Justice, and in the Council. Tomorrow, I will speak with the European Broadcasting Union, and next week with the High Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism. I will say the same thing to all of them: Portugal has signed laws, treaties and conventions that it must respect.

In this situation, large deposits of shale gas, which have been confirmed in a number of EU Member States, have inspired hope for energy independence and independence from possible action and intervention on the part of Russia, which might use this energy instrument in relations with EU countries. Unfortunately, there is a rather disconcerting document published by the European Commission and drawn up by AIA Technology, which had earlier issued a positive opinion for Gazprom regarding gas extraction from Siberian deposits, yet is now challenging the idea of shale gas extraction in Europe. It seems that this kind of company is not objective since it is financially dependent on, and involved with, Gazprom, the latter being keenly interested in preventing shale gas extraction in Poland and other EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The alleged motive for the application of these measures will not actually come about. Public debt has increased, not decreased, and the government has just increased the level of social security contributions paid by workers, yet reduced those paid by companies. This is an interesting way of implementing equality! The Troika has successfully applied its programme of assistance. When Portugal is completely destroyed and its society and economy are completely ruined, it will surely be a complete success! The Commission and the European Central Bank will rejoice!

It is upsetting that five years later, a real estate that was lawfully returned to the possession of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Romania, the Székely Mikó College of Sfântu Gheorghe, will now once again become state property according to a questionable court decision. Meanwhile, persons who were performing their statutory duties at that time are now facing a prison sentence.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union has, to its credit, invested heavily in its programmes to integrate the Roma populations. More than EUR 17 billion will be allocated over the period 2007-2013 via the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and, to a lesser extent, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, there are numerous indications that these funds have been under-utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">In Marseille, the city in which I was elected, 1 500 Roma live in inhumane and revolting conditions, which creates tensions. Expelling the Roma does not resolve their situation at all and does not address the real issue, which is their integration. We must act.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you say that the integration of the Roma, who are Europeans, is as much the responsibility of the host country as it is of the country of origin. You are right. However, we must therefore strengthen control over the use of EU subsidies and ensure that the Commission reassesses, if necessary, the national strategies adopted. Furthermore, we should entrust the management of Structural Funds granted today to locally elected bodies, which will have an interest in solving the problem because they are closer to the citizen. Parliament will then have to ensure that the use of these funds is assessed regularly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marina Yannakoudakis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– Mr President, addressing the shortage of certain tissues and cells is a question of common concern to all EU Member States. Many regularly face grave shortages in donations. The EU is a long way from being able to meet the challenge of self-sufficiency, so making it easier to find matches across Europe and save lives is a challenge which should know no boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">In producing this report, I firmly believe this is an area where the EU can truly be said to offer scope for added value. This report looks towards increasing voluntary donations, raising awareness and increasing transparency. This report is about saving lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and for their input, which made this a stronger report. There are three specific areas I felt were important for the future and which would enable this report to be forward-looking and progressive.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these was the question of the umbilical cord. The report looks to raising awareness about the harvesting of cord blood. A single umbilical cord provides ten times as many stem cells as the average bone marrow donation. Yet tragically, too few mothers across Europe are donating cord blood. Indeed, in many Member States, the option is rarely open to them. I therefore look towards extending cord blood collection to as many sites as possible. This report highlights the fact that collection methods and opportunities between public and private banks already exist in some Member States. I would like to stress that both sectors have a role to play in meeting this serious challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area the report focuses on is the use of stem cells. These are becoming increasingly important in the treatment of disease. These cells are capable of unlimited self-regeneration; thus, they can cure many diseases and repair damaged tissue.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point here is the issue of traceability. Traceability ensures the quality of the donation, but also guarantees that it is truly a voluntary donation. Traceability of tissues and cells is non-negotiable, particularly when it comes to the import of tissues and cells from third countries. Equivalent standards of quality and safety must apply, and I appeal to the Member States who have not yet done so to review, reconsider and revise their national provisions in this regard. Traceability and transparency go hand in hand with taking measures to prevent the development of a black market in gametes, particularly on the Internet. The potential for such a market undermines the quality and safety of such donations, not to mention the associated legal and ethical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area which is important to address is the question of compensation for potential donors. Let me be clear: I do not support the idea that the human body should ever be seen as a source of financial gain, and I absolutely reject the idea of an unregulated financial market in tissues and cells. Nevertheless, if we wish to attract sufficient people to come forward and provide life-saving donations, we need to consider granting a fair and proportionate financial compensation to the donor. Such compensation should be transparent, regularly audited and limited to making good the expenses incurred in making the donation.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, it is my sincere hope that this report acts as a wake-up call for all Member States to explore possible opportunities to widen international cooperation. I also hope that other Member States can build on the successes of such blood collection schemes as those run in the UK by NHS Blood and Transplant and the Anthony Nolan Trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is well known that the harvesting of cord blood and placental tissue, as previously stated, is itself a rich source of stem cells. To this end, ladies and gentlemen, we should focus on and encourage Member States – just as the report says – to harvest this source of excellent cells for a specific treatment which already exists with adult stem cells.</p>

However, it very firmly highlights the dramatic shortage facing a majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task, therefore, was to propose improvements and to work on these two important key areas. I regret the fact that, despite the rapporteur’s efforts – and I thank her once again, but she knows that – most of my colleagues think that these intangible principles of free donation and anonymity should not, quite simply, be associated with humanism and humanity, on the one hand; nor should they, on the other hand, undermine efforts to address this shortage and to fulfil the desperate expectations of so many patients in the EU. That is the reality, the reality that is lived every day by practitioners and patients, tens of thousands of whom are waiting for a cornea, bone marrow or skin transplant.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which I represent, which respects the freedom to conduct research and is mindful of the expectations of these patients, will be abstaining in tomorrow’s vote on this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. In the EU, we still need to control the handling of human organs more effectively.

<p class="contents">2. The Commission must respect the decisions of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The court, for example, expressly prohibited the patenting of human cells coming from embryos. This means that the funding of research that uses embryonic stem cells is a waste of European taxpayers’ money and must be banned.</p>

I think we have tackled the difficult problems well and we have achieved an excellent result. I would particularly like to emphasise what was also emphasised in the presentation, which is that we are ensuring that donations are voluntary, transparent and non-commercial. This last point is where the greatest risk lies. As Ms Ries also pointed out, there is going to be a drastic shortage. This gives rise to certain problems, which could lead to something that we do not want to see. In this connection, I would like to mention, first and foremost, the great shortage of human eggs. In other words, human egg cells. We have plenty of semen from men. Eggs from our women are in short supply, however, and undoubtedly, if we do not take active measures, then they will become an object of trade. People will then pay women in poorer countries to donate eggs because the demand is so great, which is why we need to stick so solidly to this point. Thank you for the fact that we have been able to reach agreement on this matter and lay down clear rules. I hope that we will succeed in getting the rest to work just as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, at present, cord blood is only collected in 1% of all births in the European Union, since many hospitals still do not point out to women in labour the value of such donations, in order to avoid shouldering the costs of managing the material collected.

<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Commission should pay special attention to the donation of cord blood, from which stem cells are derived. These are indispensable in the treatment of diseases, including childhood illnesses, and we must not continue to disregard the importance of their use.</p>

They do not always correspond to Article 3 paragraph 2 subparagraph (c) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which prohibits making the human body and its parts a source of financial gain. Legal measures applied in some Member States, which allow relatives to be paid for consenting to the donation of a deceased family member’s tissues and cells, are in clear conflict with this ethical principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important that only voluntary and unpaid donations are considered legitimate in the EU, based on an active statement of consent from the potential donor. Exploitation of the human body and its parts for commercial purposes will be prevented only by correct and transparent rules for the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells under public control, breaches of which will be penalised under criminal law. It is therefore our duty to demand that all EU states proceed in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important from an ethical perspective to ensure adequate donations of the tissues and cells needed for medical purposes. This is a sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Donation should be voluntary and anonymous. Payments for donation should be carefully defined, and should be limited to reimbursement of the costs associated with donation, such as health care costs. It should also be governed by protective legal and ethical principles which respect the integrity of the person.</p>
<p class="contents">According to many reports, however, the principle of payment-free donation is repeatedly violated. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is legally binding, prohibits making the human body and its parts a source of financial gain. Payment-free donation is therefore not only an ethical principle but is also essential for protecting the health of the donor and recipient, in view of the fact that if large sums of money form part of the donation process, donors might be motivated to take risks and might prevent risks from being discovered in their medical records. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I dare say that as a practising father, I myself am part of the programme, as my wife and I had the cord blood of all four of our children harvested and the stem cells preserved. However, the unfortunate and sad fact is that a mere 1% of all women giving birth in Europe do the same. I therefore find the aspects mentioned in the report very important. These include encouraging mothers to make use of this option as widely as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another very important principle: we must provide all our compatriots access to this possibility. Today, stem cells can only be stored in private banks at considerable cost. Less well-off people who lack the funds to access this option bar their own children and themselves from this possibility. I therefore think that this issue must be settled. An additional principle I find very important is that a single quality assurance system should be put in place in this field in order to eliminate potential problems. Medicine still has much ahead of it in terms of development. Today, we are able to use only a fraction of the potential that lies in stem cells and stem cell procedures, and I therefore think that this definitely deserves support and I myself am in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my appreciation to Ms Yannakoudakis for the report on the voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes this report. Tissue and cell transplants are of immense value to many patients. Such transplants represent a fast-evolving area of medicine and can make a real difference to people in terms of quality of life. The Commission will analyse in detail Parliament’s recommendations. In the meantime, let me assure you that the Commission acknowledges, and indeed shares, many of the concerns raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we all support the fact that the donation of tissues and cells is voluntary and unpaid. The issue of an adequate supply of tissues and cells to meet EU citizens’ medical needs is, as we know, an area of concern for many Member States. This is why I believe Member States need to strike the right balance so as to help improve the availability of tissues and cells without in any way compromising voluntary and unpaid donation.</p>
<p class="contents">The donation of tissues and cells depends on public trust in our transplant systems. Your report highlights key elements to build and maintain that trust. A transparent and safe donation system is essential for public support. Ensuring traceability of donated material between donors and recipients is essential in order to guarantee the safety and quality of the transplanted tissues and cells. Ensuring adequate information for citizens looking for tissues and cells through banking services via the Internet is important to guarantee citizens’ safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report rightly highlights the need for Member States to share best practices so as to increase donations and foster international collaboration. European and international cooperation can bring much added value, in particular, in medical fields like stem cell transplantation, where finding the right match of cells for the right patient is difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding stem cell transplantation, the Commission would like to thank Parliament for expressing its support for cord blood storage and use as an alternative source to bone marrow transplantation. It is important to ensure that good-quality cord blood samples are available for patients. In order to support Member States in their work, the Commission has already started to address some of the key issues that Parliament raises in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is developing tools to support traceability and vigilance at EU level. An EU code will be applicable to all tissues and cells exchanged between Member States as from 2014 and the communication platform for competent authorities’ rapid alerts for tissues and cells will be operational before the end of this year. Discussions with Member States are ongoing to define equivalent standards of safety and quality for tissues and cells imported from third countries. We plan to present a proposal on this issue by the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also supported several projects fostering the sharing of best practices and providing training for tissues and cells authorities under the health programme. However, despite such progress, much work still needs to be done. Public awareness about cord blood donation and how to ensure availability and access to cord blood and bone marrow across the EU need careful consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that requires thorough reflection by Member States concerns the delicate balance between compensation and remuneration. The Tissues and Cells Directive stipulates that compensation must be strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. It is up to the Member States to define such compensation, which may vary according to the specificities of the health care systems in the different Member States. Overall, the national application of the principle of voluntary and unpaid donation for tissues and cells therefore requires careful and judicious analysis within each and every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area that requires our attention is scientific and technical progress. Since the Tissues and Cells Directive was adopted, new testing methods, new storage techniques and new therapies have emerged. Such developments are being evaluated by the Commission in collaboration with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also currently finalising the transposition check of the tissue and cells legislation and preparing a survey on its implementation in the Member States. The Commission will be pleased to share the results of the survey with Parliament by the end of next year. On the basis of the results of this survey, the Commission will consider the possible review of the Tissues and Cells Directive. Your report is very timely and will be a valuable support for the Commission in undertaking this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report encourages Member States to devote the appropriate attention to harvesting stem cells from umbilical cord blood at birth and to promote better and wider cooperation between family and public banks.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present juncture when, contrary to current transplant legislation, there are still states where the trade in tissue and organs is freely conducted, it is of paramount importance to create the legal framework promoting the transparent, safe operation of tissue and cell banks for patients. The situation must be avoided where these banks are turned into profitable businesses, abusing the precarious financial position of some sections of the population. Since, in the majority of cases, the number of donors is not large enough in a Member State, the health authorities must introduce clear criteria for tissue and cell donations so as to protect the poor section of the population against abuses. Furthermore, let us not forget that it is vitally important for donors to be fully informed not only about the procedures used in the tissue and cell donation process, but also about the moral, psychological, medical and social consequences of their actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title26"></a><a name="creitem26"></a>

I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to all those who have been instrumental in giving the report its current form. Your proposals and opinions are now part of the whole, irrespective of whether they were received via amendments, consultation responses, the Facebook page that was set up for this purpose or verbally.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a cross-party report in which equality, ecology and the environment come together. It is perhaps always important to have several political perspectives, but it may be particularly important during a time of financial crisis. At a time when there is talk of economic problems and solutions to these problems, the debate often tends to be very technical. It is as if men and women do not exist, despite the fact that the economy essentially revolves around people’s ability to survive on a planet with limited resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The current economic systems do not take account of the fact that natural resources are limited. Constant growth is almost viewed as a religion. Sooner or later, however, there will be a collapse, as all goods or services that are produced require further extraction of natural resources, for example, water, energy or metals. This clearly affects ecosystems, which are the basis for our existence and welfare. We therefore really need a green economy based on equality.</p>
<p class="contents">A green or sustainable economy is a system in which we preserve the production capacity of ecosystems, the planet’s capacity to sustain us, while at the same time meeting basic human needs. Thus, the economy develops within the bounds of what nature can tolerate and guarantees a fair distribution of resources between all people on the planet – between women and men and between different generations. A green economy is therefore not merely about green technology; it is just as much about social justice. It is a question of a sustainable economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to create a sustainable future, we need to think beyond the market and its short-term perspective. This means that we need to give people’s prosperity top priority. In order to do that, we need to protect the basic functions of ecosystems, because without ecosystems, there will be no prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The green economy – the sustainable economy – will primarily be achieved through changes in the wealthy parts of the world. We are the ones who need to establish sustainable patterns of production and consumption. Current economic policy is not merely in the process of sending us down an environmentally dangerous gulley; it is also helping to increase the gaps in society between men and women, between rich and poor, and between north and south.</p>
<p class="contents">The quota of men that permeates society today must change completely in a sustainable society. Among other things, we need targeted measures, for quotas, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport, consumption, food, welfare and representation are areas that have strong links with a sustainable economy. There needs to be a gender perspective within these areas. The report contains a number of proposals within these areas. These are proposals that could lead to a sustainable economy in which men and women have the same opportunities to determine and affect the development of society, in which the planet’s limits are respected and where there is social justice between all men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report says that the state must convince women to work in the green economy, to sacrifice their families for this, and to forget about intergenerational solidarity and raising their children. At the same time, men must go and study social services. We need more pre-school facilities and hospices and the green economy cannot exist without a liberal abortion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember the promotional posters of the communists. On one, there was a woman on a tractor and on another, a woman with a pickaxe in her hand. As if the maternal instinct was a mistake of nature, as if caring for your own children and relatives had no value for society. We want to see only the woman, the man and the child, but never the family. What is the result? Social engineering, meaningless projects funded from our taxes and unsustainable pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is of vital importance to include a gender perspective when debating environmental issues. Female workers are very much under-represented in the growing renewable sector in general, and in science and technology in particular. I feel that there is a need for initiatives to encourage women to study and seek employment in these sectors. Such initiatives should promote women’s entrepreneurship in the green economy. Moreover, women should be equally represented in political decision-making bodies and involved in environmental policy making and the transition to the green economy in order to strengthen equality and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing countries, in particular, issues such as access to clean water and dependence on biomass for energy have differing effects on men and women. It is therefore imperative that modern green technologies be made available to developing countries and that these countries have access to the resources necessary to invest in the green economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would recommend that Member States strengthen and invest in local public transport systems. These investments should be focused on sustainable transport development. They should do so in order to enhance living conditions and promote social inclusion, as well as to bring about positive effects on the environment.</p>

Social sustainability means a social order based on equality and social justice, regardless of gender, ethnicity, skin colour, religion, sexual orientation, disability or political beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to gender roles, the impact of women on the environment is not the same as the impact of men. In many countries, moreover, women’s access to the resources and possibilities for controlling the situation and adapting are limited, due to structural norms and discrimination. Gender inequality, combined with a lack of sensitivity towards the different economic and social status of women and their needs, often causes women to suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of climate change also have the greatest impact on the poorest people, of whom women comprise an estimated 70%.

My thanks also go to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their views and contributions to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Empowering women and preserving their rights is indeed both an intrinsic sustainable development goal and a means to achieve the green economy we aim for. The importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment is essential in key areas, such as food security and nutrition, sustainable agriculture, water and sanitation, energy and education.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion of this topic is particularly timely as we now turn to the Rio+20 follow-up. As you know, the issue of gender played an important role there.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about the outcome of Rio+20; some have summarised it as less than we hoped but more than we expected. This also applies to gender issues. On the positive side, the EU has achieved references to gender equality and women’s empowerment, which is a step beyond Johannesburg. These elements are now reaffirmed as central to sustainable development and the outcome document when laying down our common vision and our renewed political commitment. We have also achieved a dedicated section on gender equality and the empowerment of women with key political messages on a range of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to focus on another positive side, which is sometimes overlooked in relation to Rio+20 but has been central to the EU position and to the solutions of Parliament: the mainstreaming of the gender perspective in a range of chapters in the outcome document.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to the need for gender-sensitive indicators and to poverty eradication as well as to the means of implementation, including finance, technology and capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">Rio agreed on the need to empower rural women in order to enhance agricultural and rural development, food security and nutrition. This is part of the importance attached in Rio+20 to help small producers – often women – access credit, markets, land tenure, health care, social services, education, training and technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing the gender perspective in the areas relevant to the green economy will be important for an effective follow-up to Rio+20. The Commission will take this into account when developing its follow-up actions on Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts for the transition to an inclusive green economy are just starting at EU and international level. The call by the European Parliament to ensure mainstreaming of gender equality and women’s empowerment is well-founded and it has been reflected in the Rio outcome document.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking forward to further cooperation with Parliament, including the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, on this important challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU should maintain its goals and propose concrete measures by strengthening support for renewable energy and energy efficiency, promoting less polluting means of transport and offering consumers the possibility of choosing products with a smaller environmental footprint. In this context, it is important to discuss the imbalance between men and women in the political decision-making process, which is related to the lower level of representation of women in the green economy. These factors are interlinked and require a holistic response. Equal participation in policy and the green economy is needed in order to ensure that the interests and different needs of men and women are duly considered. It is well known, for example, that climate change does not affect men and women, rich and poor, developed countries and developing countries to the same extent. As a result, the eradication of inequality and making the green economy more efficient are related. In order to overcome this imbalance, the Member States need to adopt the appropriate measures, including gender quotas. These measures are aimed at ensuring that economic development is based on a fair distribution of resources among individuals, among men and women, and among different generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as our resources are becoming more and more scarce and there are doubts about the sustainability of our way of life, the European regulator needs to question and correct one of the ongoing system’s most striking deficiencies: the inequality between women and men on both the economic and environmental level. It appears nowadays that, on the one hand, women pollute less than men for various reasons, such as the fact they eat less meat, they drive less, and they consume less because their salaries are lower and because they have less time for leisure and energy-consuming activities. On the other hand, horizontal segregation contributes to women being as under-represented in qualified jobs as over-represented in unqualified jobs. The fact there are no women candidates for the ECB board is a good illustration of this situation: is there no woman in the EU fitting the requirements to acquire even candidate status for this board? I am glad the EU is underlining these paradoxes, as the measures we are taking today to ensure our economic growth will be decisive in shaping tomorrow’s green and equal society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title27"></a><a name="creitem27"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iratxe García Pérez, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the service sector represents almost 70% of total employment in the EU, and 83% of the active female population works in this sector. I therefore believe that the work carried out on this report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is fundamental, and I want to begin by thanking all my colleagues for the work they have done on amendments and follow-up negotiations; they made it possible to get this job done and to improve the original report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, we have tried to reflect issues such as precarity, stereotypes, the digital divide, the pay gap, reconciliation, the glass ceiling, training, new technologies – issues that are central to the debate on equality and the situation of women in the labour market. However, I believe it is important to refer to some important matters that have also been the subject of an interesting debate in the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to flexibility, it is true that labour flexibility at certain times may help women join the labour market when they are trying to reconcile work and family life, but we should not forget that this flexibility cannot come at the cost of having the employer propose and maintain the working conditions; instead, it has to come about through collective negotiation and the role that women can play in promoting a reconciliation between work and family life, because otherwise, that reconciliation will not be possible and, therefore, flexibility will not be positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question we have also brought up in the report concerns the issues surrounding part-time contracts. The majority of part-time contracts are held by women, and this can be an opportunity, but only if that opportunity means giving women the free choice to enter the labour market under such conditions and, of course, men too, because we should not forget that reconciling work and family life is the responsibility of both men and women, and we cannot always leave women to shoulder the vitally important task of caring for children, dependent persons and the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report therefore, we also wanted to make reference to the importance of public care services for children, the disabled and other dependants. Today, 80% of informal carers are women, and we therefore need free and quality public services, and we should not facilitate the dismantling – as is happening in many Member States – of the welfare state, public education and those social services that can help women join the labour market on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wanted to raise the important issue of the pay gap, which has been brought up many times by Parliament. The pay gap shows that women, as I said earlier, are mostly working part-time or in very precarious jobs, which not only means there is a pay gap in terms of the wages they currently earn, but also that these women’s future retirement pension rights are far weaker than men’s.</p>
<p class="contents">The gender pay gap is therefore a crucial issue that the Commission and Member States must address and develop in order for the gap to be narrowed; of course, another vital matter to bear in mind concerns all the issues surrounding work inspections and the monitoring of companies’ policies on working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We were keen to make reference to the need to re-examine the question of the Maternity Directive. I believe that Parliament has been calling for this for quite some time, and the issue is not only maternity leave but also paternity leave, which is important and relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall finish by saying that we cannot allow this economic crisis to bring about a deterioration in the labour market and in working conditions because, in the end, that falls primarily on the shoulders of those who are already experiencing the most difficulty: in this case, on the shoulders of women in the labour market. Therefore, we will have to continue working and urging the Commission to carry out its own work on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important sector, as the level of female employment is high and represents 25% of the total employment of women. This sector suffers from typical problems faced by women who are active in the labour market, namely: they are employed in capacities below their level of qualification, they are paid less than men for the same work and they are forced to work part time. To a large extent, this is caused by the difficulties women are confronted with when trying to reconcile family life and their careers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, we yet again call for the creation of an appropriate and affordable infrastructure for the care of children and the elderly. With regard to unequal pay, we reiterate our appeal to the Member States, employers and trade unions to develop and implement specific performance assessment instruments which would facilitate the definition of work of equal value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There still remain different gradings for the same work, while only one in seven board members in Europe’s biggest corporations were female in 2010. It is high time women were seen as just as capable as men. Working hours that make it possible to combine professional and family life, the opportunity to have child care to that same end and access to permanent upskilling programmes are things that I see as an appropriate start in order to move in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a concentration to be seen in certain fields, such as care, mediation, marketing and teaching, and not only as a result of social stereotypes, as the report claims. Rather, women also bring very special skills to specialist fields. Marketing and mediation are thus classical female professions because women are generally better than their male colleagues at putting themselves in the shoes of others.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absurd to believe that there is suddenly a need for more male nursery school teachers or more female plumbers. That is of benefit neither to women nor to society as a whole.

I said very clearly that we should not force blessings on people. Naturally, if more men are able to feel enthused by that kind of work, that is absolutely legitimate, and it is welcome if women also feel enthused by technical professions. A forced blessing, however, does not make sense, if you ask me. I would stress, once again, that it is important that, in this connection, people’s professions – be it teaching or care – should have their status fundamentally enhanced. If these professions were to obtain a better image, if pay were improved and made equal for all, whether male or female, access would be equally attractive to both men and women.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Dalli, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Ms García Pérez for her report on the working conditions of female workers. This report offers a comprehensive but gloomy picture – an assessment that the Commission shares.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are over-represented in low-quality, precarious positions and frequently have few opportunities for career advancement. Lack of policies to reconcile work and family or private life, inappropriate incentives or rigid gender roles can contribute to this unfavourable situation. The presence of children, too, often dampens women’s employment prospects significantly. This is an issue that has to be dealt with urgently, as a woman’s decision to have a child should not imply her exclusion from the labour market. The persistence of the gender pay gap, women’s lower representation in decision-making positions and the barriers facing immigrant women are all further issues we have to fight against.</p>
<p class="contents">Overcoming these challenges features high on the Commission’s political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">First, although there is no definite target for female employment rates in the Europe 2020 strategy, it says that the 75% employment rate in the 20-64 age group should be achieved through the greater involvement of women. The Europe 2020 strategy also sets a target for reducing the number of Europeans at risk of poverty by at least 20 million by 2020, which can hardly be achieved without better inclusion of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, gender issues were prominent during the European Semester of enhanced policy coordination. The solid conclusion emerging from the first European Semester was that the Member States need to put in place a comprehensive policy mix to combat the gender employment gap and its main causes. Country-specific recommendations were issued to several Member States in 2011 and 2012 in this area. They have focused on the need to offer affordable, available and quality care services, to remove fiscal disincentives for second earners from the tax benefit system, to provide flexible working arrangements and to combat the gender pay gap.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has monitored actions taken by the Member States in this field and taken stock of progress made but has noted that additional efforts were necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has instruments to help Member States design and implement more efficient actions in this area. Addressing equal treatment for women can be found in our few recent initiatives that underline the importance of a growing and inclusive workforce and a more equal society.</p>
<p class="contents">First, our engagement is reflected in the priorities of the strategy for equality between women and men, which defines actions addressing cross-cutting women-related issues. The gender pay gap in the EU is one of these. Its persistence indicates a need to tackle the underlying causes and to enforce the existing rules more effectively. The Commission will report on the implementation of its directive on equal pay matters in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has recently launched an initiative which will help to raise the awareness of companies about the business and economic case for gender equality, such as the gender pay gap. Training activities and exchanges of good practices for and by companies will be organised starting this autumn. Furthermore, we will mark again European Equal Pay Day in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">This House knows and supports Vice-President Reding’s commitment to making rapid progress on the representation of women in top positions in the corporate sector. Given the insufficient and unequal progress so far, the Commission is now considering taking an EU-level measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I would also draw your attention to the employment package, which points to women’s integration into the labour market. The employment package also calls on the Member States to establish national job plans within their national reform programmes and use them to focus on job creation and to fine-tune the use of the structural funds to increase employment opportunities. Indeed, stronger governance of employment policy can provide a strong framework for improving the work conditions of the female workforce. According to the sectoral approach of the package, the Commission will promote white-collar, green and ICT careers in order to attract under-represented profiles such as women.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, a job is the best guarantee to avoid unemployment and exclusion in society. However, at the outset of the current economic downturn, social inclusion should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment is clear: to encourage development of the necessary social services within the framework of elaborating policy options and tackling the long-term care challenges. It can ease employment patterns so that women can enter the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these provisions make things change on the ground and will close the gap between women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my personal view, we need more effective policies promoting the balance between work and family life, especially as the overwhelming majority of parents who apply for parental leave are women, an inequality which is also being felt by children.</p>
<p class="contents">One effective solution is to encourage female entrepreneurship, together with devising training programmes involving new technologies, an area where surveys indicate a gender gap. This restricts the opportunities women have to gain access to higher qualified jobs and receive higher salaries and, in the long term, it deprives them of the chance to develop their career.

A quarter of all non-typical employees work in the service sector; in the German retail trade, there are almost a million so-called ‘mini-jobs’. Working women, who represent eight out of 10 of those employed in the service sector, are particularly strongly affected by this. We have already achieved a great deal in respect of equality between men and women, and we are on the right path to achieving even more. However, in the context of services, specifically, it is particularly important that agreement is finally reached on the Posting of Workers Directive. Women are particularly strongly affected by this: 58% of all the women working in posted positions in Germany work in the service sector. The percentage of female workers in, for example, care work is considerably higher than in many other sectors, and the working conditions are often very poor. What we need are minimum wage rates, limits on working hours and safety standards that are reasonable for all female workers in Europe. We can only achieve these objectives if we lay down clear rules for the posting of workers by temporary employment agencies. I am therefore pleased to see that the rapporteur takes up the subject of mobility in her opinion. We advocate a clearly regulated legal framework for Europe’s internal market in the field of services in order to prevent precarious labour relations and discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title28"></a><a name="creitem28"></a>

However, the signs also indicate that the common European asylum system will not meet our initial expectations. Nonetheless, we hope that at least some positive steps will be made and that others – albeit fragmented – steps will follow. This report is predicated on precisely this gradual approach. In it, Parliament sends the European Commission and the Member States a clear message of its expectations in terms of strengthening solidarity in the asylum sector within the European Union. We have managed in this report to express the abstract concept of solidarity in specific terms, by stressing the importance of a fair distribution of responsibility between the various Member States. Now we are waiting for the Commission to forward the relevant legislative proposals to us, so that we can continue the job we undertook back in 1999. I should like to take this opportunity to express my warmest thanks to all sides in Parliament for their excellent cooperation on this dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, even once negotiations have been completed, the report will provide a reference point in terms of problems with the common asylum package and in terms of the need for greater solidarity and an equal distribution of the burdens, as the rapporteur quite rightly said.

One seldom hears about the countries which share a border with the eastern neighbours of the EU. It is true that the pressure on borders is somewhat weaker there. Ultimately, however, this is a great challenge for us and for the European Union. We cannot have this dividing line between the problems faced by the southern and northern EU Member States. It is important for us to have a common policy, and I am delighted that so many of my colleagues have spoken about European solidarity. We need shared management of our borders. Poland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs is even talking about a single border guard service. Once a common system is in place, we will be able to take adequate care of those people, protect their rights, their dignity and freedoms, and allow them to put their past tragic events behind them and live a decent life in the European Union once they have arrived. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The logical response of the southern European countries most affected by the wave of migration was a request for the material and organisational burden resulting from the influx of migrants to be redistributed to other EU countries. As often happens in life, an apparently simple solution does not always have to bring good results.</p>
<p class="contents">Migrants seeking asylum come to Europe with the hope that they will continue their lives here in more dignified and more civilised conditions. They know that the language of the former colonial power they learned at school in their home country is readily spoken in a certain part of Europe and they will be able to integrate into the population there.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we tell a French speaking family from Algeria or an English speaking family from India or Egypt that their new asylum home must be Estonia or Romania, we will be confronting them with a language barrier that is difficult to overcome, which will profoundly disillusion them and complicate their chances of integrating into the new environment. In the interests of a sensitive and humanitarian solution to the situation of asylum seekers, we should leave it up to them to decide where in the EU to settle, and help them integrate into society wherever they can most easily do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I sympathise very much, of course, with colleagues or countries facing an onslaught of migrants particularly from Africa, and we know this includes Malta, Italy and Greece. Countries such as my own country, however, are confronted with new migrants who no longer see the country as a transit country but also settle finally or want to settle in Slovakia, where I live.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very proud of the fact that Slovakia has made huge progress. I visited an asylum centre in Humenné, where I saw that the conditions for asylum seekers were of a very high standard, and that they are cared for both in health and social terms, and that the issue of integration, of course, was very well looked after. I hope that this directive or this document will be successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s contribution to the development of intra-EU solidarity in the field of asylum. I am happy to see that our views converge on the key approaches, especially the view that solidarity has to go hand in hand with the responsibility of all those involved to meet their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The lines along which solidarity should develop have been identified and confirmed by all our institutions: practical cooperation and technical assistance, with coordinating and supporting action from EASO, which must go hand in hand with legislative harmonisation; financial solidarity, via a flexible and easy-to-mobilise system, underpinned by closer partnerships among all those involved; and the fair allocation of responsibilities among Member States for both asylum seekers and other beneficiaries of international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me share with you the Commission’s guiding principles in developing a sound framework for EU solidarity on asylum. First, our action on solidarity should be comprehensive and balanced. Mutual support needs to go further than just combating irregular migration. Solidarity also involves relocation, resettlement and a well-functioning, common European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, solidarity in asylum is not primarily about emergency or reactive action. The best way to achieve mutual trust is for solidarity to be built into Member States’ everyday practice, for example, by supporting integration efforts. We should keep such everyday solidarity sharply in our focus in the future, not least because it is less politically visible than emergency action.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it will be essential to follow up all the commitments made. As we announced in March, the Commission will report on solidarity issues in its annual report on immigration and asylum, starting next year. To prepare this report, the Commission will invite Member States to an expert meeting this autumn to discuss the current state of play.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to address the criticism the report makes of the application of the Dublin Regulation, and the related suggestion to develop instead an EU system for relocating asylum seekers. The Dublin system is certainly not ideal. The Commission evaluation in 2007 acknowledged the disproportionate burden on some Member States due to their geographical position. Other situations also need to be acknowledged: as recent experience showed, Member States without an external border can also experience disproportionate flows.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that standards in Member States are unequal and sometimes insufficient, which gives some asylum seekers better chances than others. These problems will be addressed by the current reform of the Dublin Regulation and by more harmonisation in the second phase of the CEAS. So, completing our interinstitutional negotiations on the CEAS is vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than anything, this policy must also measure up to the mark in possible crisis situations in Europe’s neighbourhood. The current system grew up historically and also dates from a time when there were fewer Member States in the Union. Reform has hitherto proven extremely difficult, as the subject of asylum has become a priority domestic issue in most Member States. Time and again, the populist exploitation of this issue to be observed pretty much everywhere makes it difficult to attempt to reach a solution in a way that is reasonable and satisfies the principle of solidarity within Europe. The report on enhanced intra-EU solidarity in the field of asylum is an important attempt to disentangle this difficult situation. It is right to point out in the report the necessity of a greater sense of responsibility within the EU. The establishment of the common asylum policy, which is still scheduled for 2012, must be judged against this axiom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title29"></a><a name="creitem29"></a>

Two years ago, Parliament and the Council signed off a major reform of the European system. We had not expected to be back here tonight updating that legislation before it took effect, but that was before the Mediator case in France, which highlighted potential weaknesses in what we had already agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">My big priority in the course of negotiations over the last few weeks has been to strengthen the hand of regulators in the pharmaceutical system and, by doing so, to improve patient safety. Two things struck me when I looked at the Mediator case. Firstly, safety issues had been discussed at the European Medicines Agency on a number of occasions among regulators, but no formal referral had ever been made, and the issue was dropped. The company withdrew the medicine from markets in some countries for commercial reasons. The second issue which struck me was that the French and Italian authorities had requested a safety study from Servier back in 2000 because of these concerns, but that study was not finished until almost a decade later. By that time, the medicine had been withdrawn because of the vigilance of a regional pharmacovigilance expert in France.</p>
<p class="contents">So, when we looked at the revision, we made several key changes. The first is that, in future, companies will be under much more scrutiny when they voluntarily withdraw a medicine from the market anywhere in the world: this must be reported to the EMA and questions can be asked. Secondly, whenever there is any concern about safety, there will now be an automatic trigger which will lead to an investigation at European level. There will not be national discretion over that decision. Thirdly, when a post-authorisation safety study is requested, that study will have to be carried out. Drugs which are subject to a study will now be labelled with a black triangle so that health professionals and the public know that drug is subject to a post-authorisation safety study. What struck me about the French case was that the French regulator said that it did not have the powers to actually make a post-authorisation safety study happen. This cannot be allowed to happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, two outstanding issues came up during the course of negotiations which MEPs hope you will comment on tonight. The first was the issue of fee regulation for the EMA. We need enough money to be able to carry out our pharmacovigilance work properly. The second is the issue of the black box of essential information on the patient information leaflet. You have sent me a letter about these matters and I know that you say that the Commission will look very carefully at both these issues. I hope you will make a comment on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who are here this evening for the all the hard work they have put in on this dossier. I thank the Danish Presidency, the Commission and the Council Presidency. The Council Presidency helped us expedite the work quickly so that we could reach an agreement before the summer so that it takes effect at the same time as the other changes to the pharmacovigilance legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pharmacovigilance makes a crucial contribution to public health and is key to the safety of patients.</p>
<p class="contents">May I take this opportunity to thank all those who worked very hard to make this agreement possible – in particular Ms McAvan, rapporteur for the lead committee, who has successfully facilitated the early conclusion of this dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">The stress test following the Mediator case identified certain gaps in our legislation. The proposal under consideration today will strengthen the transparency and reporting requirements of the 2010 package on pharmacovigilance. In particular, more categories of products will be subject to increased monitoring with a view to improving the reporting of adverse reactions to such medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there will be greater transparency of the reasons for the withdrawal, interruption or non-renewal of the marketing of a product, as companies will have to declare the reasons for these. This will help to minimise the risk that a product falls through the net and thus escapes scrutiny when safety concerns are identified.</p>
<p class="contents">The confidence of patients in medicinal products is essential for therapeutic compliance; such confidence can only be achieved and maintained if patients trust our system. I am pleased that the proposal on which Parliament will vote tomorrow addresses the gaps identified in the existing pharmacovigilance legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stands fully behind this agreement and is very pleased that it was concluded between the institutions before the summer break. As part of the agreement, with respect to the legislation on fees related to pharmacovigilance activities, the Commission makes the following statement:</p>
<p class="contents">On 18 June 2012, the Commission launched a public consultation on a concept paper concerning the introduction of fees for pharmacovigilance, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 and Directive 2010/84/EU, which is open for comments until 15 September 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">After examination of the comments received, the Commission will prepare an impact assessment which is one of the necessary steps in the legislative process before the Commission puts forward a legislative proposal. The Commission will continue to work on this file as a priority with the intention of presenting a legislative proposal as soon as possible to the European Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was very important because the regulation we adopted in 2010 was coming into force and it needed to be amended. It was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation – quite the contrary. Rather, it was amended because, as has been said, recent events took place, of which we are all aware, showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again. It was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market.</p>

<p class="contents">This is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision. Moreover, in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country, all the Member States in which that medicine is marketed must be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will improve transparency and safety, without the European Medicines Agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role, and Parliament should therefore adopt this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the European Union has acted very quickly here. Something that was regarded as modern and effective as recently as 2010 has proven to be inadequate in such a short space of time, and we must now act together as quickly as possible to put it in order. These loopholes need to be closed. The document before us shows very clearly where work needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We need transparency and we need speed, as we need patients and consumers to have confidence in their drugs. Above all, we need confidence in the system. We need close collaboration in order for it still to be possible to later monitor medicinal products that have already been authorised in Europe, in order to be able to ensure that adverse reactions and, above all, harmful side effects are detected as quickly as possible and that the entire European market is informed in the shortest possible time. In other words, medicines cannot simply quietly and secretly disappear from the market when producers have noticed that there may be some harmful side effects. Instead, such occurrences must be explained. We need this transparency, we need the urgency and we also need the longer monitoring periods.</p>
<p class="contents">What we very particularly need is the close cooperation with the patient, but also with the staff working in health care, as I believe that the pharmacovigilance package can ultimately only work if everyone knows about it, in other words, if this information also coalesces. Legislation of this kind can only really work if patients are able to make sense of the package insert and if, on the other side of the coin – as Ms McAvan mentioned – the European Medicines Agency also has the necessary financial means to be able to meet all the responsibilities handed over to it in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Less than two years after the case in France, we shall review the remaining gaps and loopholes in our European pharmacovigilance framework. All the European institutions and stakeholders are demonstrating today that when patient safety is at stake, actions can be taken swiftly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group welcomes the agreement, which will be put to the vote tomorrow, upgrading our new framework adopted in 2010 with a clear focus on transparency, efficiency, follow-up mechanisms and the reinforcement of the monitoring of drugs placed on the market but subject to post-authorisation studies.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome two key elements of the future provisions to be implemented: the obligation for companies to communicate the reasons for withdrawing a product from the market and the automatic trigger of the emergency procedure when this decision is taken due to safety concerns. We must indeed keep in mind that, in addition to guaranteeing the highest level of patient safety, the good functioning of our pharmacovigilance system is also a tool to reinforce European citizens’ confidence and understanding of the medicines they are taking. As decision makers, we have a public health responsibility, which we are taking today in ensuring the efficiency of our system and adapting it when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to mention the need to provide sufficient resources for the European Medicines Agency to assume effectively its new missions.

<p class="contents">Recent cases have shown the need for a further improvement of the system. It is appropriate to continually define a medicinal product’s tolerability profile under actual conditions of use and to promote balance in the use of medicinal products among the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Medicinal products that require additional monitoring or are subject to a post-authorisation safety study (PASS) should be labelled to that effect using a black symbol. In addition, doctors, patients and the authorities must be told in good time – meaning as soon as possible – when and why a medicinal product that had, up to then, been regarded as safe is withdrawn from the market. Clearly, we cannot allow a situation where investors in pharmaceutical companies are informed before doctors and pharmacists. Ultimately, the monitoring of medicinal products, as good as it is, only serves patients if it warns them in good time of a dangerous medicine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not know exactly how many people lost their lives – reports vary from 500 to 2 000 – but every death is one too many. This was a case of irresponsible behaviour on the part of the company but, unfortunately, there were also gaps in the law. These gaps in the law urgently need to be closed. I would therefore like to offer my heartfelt thanks to Ms McAvan, to the shadow rapporteurs and, in particular, to Ms Ayuso in my group, and to Commissioner Dalli, who produced this proposal efficiently and guided the whole process very constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that, in future, precise reasons will have to be given when a medicine is no longer marketed – no one can be in any doubt in this regard – and it is also important that the information is then shared between the Member States competently and accurately so that cases like this do not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Weisgerber and I have tabled an amendment on a drug facts box going beyond what the Commission has already proposed. I want to emphasise that, when using the English terms, we should talk not of a ‘black box’, but of a ‘drug facts box’. We might well not be dealing with a box that is black, you see. That was, after all, possibly one of the reasons why this proposal, which was tabled by the Commission once before, was rejected in the past. A black box is possibly not the right way to indicate this kind of information. However, we do need to improve the package insert.</p>
<p class="contents">A system of drug facts boxes has proven itself in the United States. We still have the problem that our package inserts are too complicated. To put it in a somewhat simplified and exaggerated way: there are two kinds of patients. One group do not read the package inserts at all, as they do not understand anything on them anyway, and throw them away. The other group read the package insert quite carefully, are scared by the many potential side effects and consequently do not take the drug. As a doctor, I have experience of both groups, and it goes without saying that both approaches are wrong. We need collaboration between doctors and patients. When important side effects occur, people need to get in touch with a doctor quickly. However, the drug must be taken as prescribed. With antibiotics in particular, it is important that patients must not stop taking a drug when they feel a little better, as that is how resistance develops.</p>
<p class="contents">All this kind of information could be much better presented in a drug facts box than it is on current package inserts and, as I mentioned, this approach has proven itself in the United States. I am therefore very grateful that the Commissioner has promised to include this in further investigations, and I hope that we will soon have a proposal on this that is as precise as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Mediator drug mentioned earlier was registered in many European countries through national procedures, and despite the fact that the first reports of undesirable effects in its main active ingredient – mentioning fears of potential heart valve failure – appeared as early as 1999, the drug was prescribed very widely in Europe up to 2009, when it was taken off the market, with prescriptions handed out to 5 million people. The number of deaths related to this medicine is estimated to be as high as 2 000, up to 2 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that concerns over this drug were discussed by regulatory bodies at various meetings at European level, and despite all of the properly documented concerns, no decision was taken for this drug to undergo scientific assessment at EU level. The regulatory bodies took no further measures.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts show very clearly that safety in respect of drugs policy and drugs must be reinforced at EU level. I therefore support the aim of revising the legislation from 2010 and, at the same time, I would like to emphasise the need to achieve this amendment as quickly as possible, in the interests of public health. I would also like to thank the rapporteur very much for the finely drafted opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, there have been too many victims of this system failure, in France anyway, where, as has already been mentioned, the drug was not withdrawn from the market until 2009, six years after the same decision was taken in Italy and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">This scandal has quite clearly been the catalyst for the revisions we are debating this evening. These revisions are essential given the widespread but risky practice of marketing non-prescription medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">The shortcomings in the legislation we adopted in this very Chamber just two years ago are clearly highlighted. The legislative framework is reinforced where necessary. Yes, it is essential to compel manufacturers to give their reasons for withdrawing a drug from the market or for not applying to renew a marketing licence. Yes, this alarm, this triggering of the emergency procedure when practitioners stress that taking this medicine results in adverse patient reactions, must be made systematic.</p>

I welcome the idea that the Commission and the European Medicines Agency bear more responsibility for the safety of pharmaceuticals. The agency’s broad mandate, which includes granting commercial licences to manufacturers, valid across the European Union, have been linked with the obligation to warn of dangers that have been detected but have not been the subject of state-level intervention. In the widely publicised case of a lethal drug in France, European institutions were, for many years, unable to have the drug prohibited in its country of origin while successive Member States withdrew it from the market. We know that there was a conflict of interest between the supervisory authority and the manufacturers of the medicine who financed it. We realise that the pharmaceutical companies are in too powerful a position. The battle is a difficult one, but victory remains possible and efforts should be continued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we can say that European patients are much safer with this new amendment to the legislation and the regulation, and that patient protection is indeed one of our priorities. In view of all this, as I do not want to repeat what has already been said, and because I support the comments in their entirety, I would just like to mention a couple of things that occurred to me during this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the fact that the economic crisis is causing setbacks in the areas of health care and public health. Therefore, in order to make the most of your presence here, Commissioner, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that we cannot allow the economic crisis to prevent the package comprising the three pieces of legislation relating to medicines, including pharmacovigilance, counterfeit medicines and information given to patients, from being put on the waiting list, using the crisis as an excuse for failing to grant patients access to all the care, information and medicines to which they should be entitled. Neither can we in any way accept that this should be the case!</p>
<p class="contents">A second point occurred to me during this discussion: in 2010, we voted at the first reading of the directive, but here we are in 2012 and I see that we have actually gone backwards, as now we are talking about the quality of the medicines. Today, in 2012, what might have been a rare case in 2010 has become an epidemic, and people are dying in Portugal and Greece due to lack of access to medicines. This problem is not caused by the pharmaceutical laboratories, but by this laboratory here. I sincerely hope that we succeed in addressing these problems, as medicines represent advances in public health and health care, and we cannot ignore these problems, which touch upon a vital part of people’s lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His ability to respond swiftly enabled stress tests to be carried out on the legislation we have just adopted concerning pharmacovigilance in order to identify additional lessons which needed to be learned in the light of the Mediator case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, experience has shown that there were weaknesses in our legislation. Today, we are providing solutions to the various weaknesses we have identified. In so doing, we are increasing transparency and strengthening communication with regard to the safety of medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think that one weakness remains. Regrettably, this new legislation does not address the central issue of off-label prescriptions, which, in fact, represent 15% to 20% of all prescriptions, or indeed more in certain areas (including paediatrics, psychiatry and cancer research). Indeed, doctors may prescribe off-label medicines when other solutions for the treatment of a given disease are limited or non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">Prescribing such medicines may be useful but it is not without danger, as it is carried out without any form of validation by the health authorities. Most importantly, in terms of pharmacovigilance, it gives rise to very little feedback on adverse reactions by health care professionals, who were afraid that such information would establish their liability.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that my proposal, drafted with my colleague, Ms Ries, to mandate the European Medicines Agency (EMA), in partnership with the relevant national authorities, to develop guidelines on this point was not adopted in the final compromise. Stricter control of this type of prescription would enable a balance to be maintained between the need to prevent the unauthorised use of medicines and the need to fill gaps in treatment to meet special medical needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that Mediator was often used, in one out of five cases, off-label. I think that it is essential to demonstrate vigilance in this regard and I await Commissioner Dalli’s response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good pharmacovigilance protects the citizens of Europe. At the same time, we are also bolstering informed patients. It was therefore very important to close the safety loopholes exposed and actually opened up by the Mediator case as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, a company that removes a medicinal product from the market must state the reasons why it is doing so. The other Member States will also be informed via the European Medicines Agency – something that is irremissible for the protection of patients in Europe’s internal market, too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point that is particularly close to my heart, which is the better readability of package inserts. Many patients really do complain about the complexity of package inserts. They say they are too difficult, too hard to understand, too unreadable, too confusing. This is a subject that the older elements of the population in particular bring up, although it is not only them. Some patients are even so scared by the side effects when trying to find important information that, in the end, they do not even take the medicine. Together with Mr Liese, I therefore advocated the idea that the package insert should be made more readable for patients and that a drug facts box containing the most important information, including the side effects, should be included on the package insert, written in plain language and given graphic emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about the result obtained from the negotiations, and about the fact that the Commission, Commissioner Dalli, has also promised to produce a report on better readability. I hope that the Commission will keep its promise and also that it does so as soon as possible. I would be interested to hear – and I am happy to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Dalli with us here today – whether there are already specific ideas in this regard at this point. I would be really interested to hear the answer to that question. I would like to offer my thanks to the Commission for having tackled this issue, as it really does represent a major step towards patient friendliness if we can improve the package insert and make it more readable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is a matter of special importance, and stands as proof that this is an issue in which the Commission and Parliament are capable of cooperation. I hope that this cooperation will soon result in the agreement that is essential for the settlement of the issue. There are some very important matters that this case revealed. Firstly, deficiencies still remain in respect of safety risk warnings. I cannot stress enough that this is once again a case where it is the poorest and least educated who are the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, as my fellow Members, including Mr Liese, pointed out, the descriptions of the side effects of drugs are long and complicated. Most people do not even read these, or are unable to understand their contents. This is one of the reasons why it is important to regain the trust of patients by responding rapidly and accurately to cases of abuse, which can, unfortunately, occur in this field as well. We need only think back to the situation of four or five years ago, where the distribution of H1N1 vaccines caused considerable internal political tensions in Hungary, for example. However, this did not just happen in Hungary but in several other European countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I still remember the stand made by a Polish minister who herself encouraged the Polish people to not take this vaccine, arguing that the side effects were uncertain, and that children and pregnant women should not be exposed to risks that have not yet been investigated due to insufficient time. I therefore believe that rapid response is a responsibility of the EU, and this procedure, too, proves that it is capable of such a response. In important cases where the health and lives of our citizens are at stake, we are capable of setting aside our political disputes to follow a common path to achieve significant results together. I believe that this report exemplifies that it is worth encouraging cooperation in this matter. I very much hope that this, too, will produce quick results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The safety of pharmaceuticals available in the single market is, indeed, of paramount importance to citizens. The European Parliament, as well as other European institutions, must continue their systematic efforts, doing their utmost, in these changing times and retail conditions, to ensure that citizens can be certain about products that are available not only in shops and pharmacies but also online. The case of the medicine named Mediator, which we are discussing here, triggered the revision of this directive and the pharmacovigilance regulation. This is certainly a step in the right direction. We must improve supervision of products being sold in the single market. There are many counterfeit products and many extremely dangerous substances, and there are no warnings or campaigns which inform citizens and consumers which sources are dangerous, how a medicine can be verified, and where not to buy them. Any counterfeit products may be very dangerous, but here we really are talking about a direct threat to human health and life.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens are not being adequately informed about the consequences of taking a particular substance. I fully agree with Peter Liese, who states that information is often overly complicated and sometimes incomplete. This is why I extend my special congratulations to Peter Liese and Anja Weisgerber in connection with the drug facts box initiative. Indeed, it is likely to benefit the consumers of medications and may lead to a regime which would require clarity of information regarding the content and effects of particular substances.</p>
<p class="contents">And a brief question to Commissioner Dalli. You referred to consultations.

This will enable both patients and health care professionals to act accordingly. At the same time, the side effects of medicinal products must be monitored much more closely. This will put an end to cases like the one involving Mediator, the medicine from France which nearly all my colleagues have mentioned.</p>

<p class="contents">There is some doubt, of course, as to whether this informational obligation also applies to third countries outside the EU. I also support publication of the reasons for a refusal to authorise the placing of medicines on the market. This is all well and good. I would also, of course, like to call on the Commission to analyse the impact of European legislation on other areas when it discovers problems in Member States, and to propose amendments in a prompt and timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention as an example fraudulent mail order businesses, in relation to which the Commission is still unable to rectify matters, despite petitions from European citizens, and interventions and resolutions of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example might be the issue that has dragged on for over three years in relation to the Canadian visa requirement for Czech citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the black box referred to by Ms McAvan, there is an ongoing project to analyse the feasibility and value added of certain information that will be summarised in what is now being called the drug fact box. The studies will involve collaboration with the European Medicines Agency and national competent authorities, as well as consultations with organisations at EU level representing patients, consumers, doctors and pharmacists, social health insurers and industry. The report on the readability of the package information requested by Parliament in 2010 and the outcome of the study on the drug fact box is expected to be ready by mid-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Matias that we cannot allow the financial crisis to punch holes in our health care system. Health is, in my view, a fundamental right of all our citizens. Apart from this, health is a major motor of economic growth, and cutting health is based on a major fallacy. We look forward to the adoption of the new legislation and its application, which will benefit EU citizens by strengthening both safety and transparency, and, in particular, to a greater number of medicinal products that will be subject to increased monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the drug fact box, I think Mr Liese is correct. The problem people have is information overload. When you read it, it is more like a lawyer’s list to get companies off the hook if anything goes wrong, which is a list of anything that could go wrong. So people do not believe the patient information leaflets, they are not useful to patients, and we do urgently need to look at this problem again.</p>
<p class="contents">But, finally, one special thank you I want to make is to my researcher, Ms Hanks, who has put in a tremendous amount of work over the last two-and-half years on this whole dossier of pharmacovigilance and she, like all our assistants, works extremely hard on our behalf and on behalf of the people of Europe, and often they are not so recognised in the work that we do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is deplorable that such a tragedy had to occur, which has affected the lives of thousands of people, to make those involved withdraw the medicine from the market and initiate the legal reforms required to guarantee the system’s safety. I would like to thank the rapporteur and the other political groups who responded quickly and readily to dialogue in order to plug the gaps in the previous legislation. The credit for the Council accepting Parliament’s position goes to our negotiating team.

They also extend the list of drugs subject to additional monitoring. However, the Commission did the very bare minimum after the Mediator scandal. We should remember that its initial proposals on the texts adopted in 2010 were quite simply unacceptable. We had to fight to get rid of measures that were very favourable to the laboratories, making it easier for them to put on the market drugs that had been insufficiently tested with no therapeutic justification in terms of risk and benefit. Unfortunately, these minor changes do not integrate the fundamental measures we had asked for: the financial, hierarchical and intellectual independence of pharmacovigilance activities relating to the industry and medicines agencies, and the implementation of the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic progress in order to obtain a marketing licence. Nonetheless, Ms McAvan’s reports still represent progress in the expectation that a truly ambitious text will be proposed at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title30"></a><a name="creitem30"></a>
