<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Anne Ferreira, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. − </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions for their valuable assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we can be satisfied with the balanced report adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is the result of joint efforts. The European Union is unquestionably committed to the environment, both internally and at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Having set a number of objectives in order to meet the urgent environmental needs facing us, the European Union has to devise ways of achieving them. To do that, it has, over the years, adopted legislation that is regularly revised and applicable in the Union. It invests in research, raises public awareness and encourages good practice by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are suggesting looking at another possibility, that of market-based instruments. The report is based on the Commission paper, which contains a number of proposals and ideas that I welcome. Firstly, it endeavours to improve on a text that, in my view, focuses a little too much on climate change. That is certainly a crucial issue, but we must not ignore the whole picture, all the fields of human activity whose impact on the environment is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I did not, unfortunately have any information from the consultation that might have helped us in our work. In the Green Paper, the Commission is proposing to achieve the environmental targets at a lower and a reasonable cost. That should be possible with the economic instruments which are, moreover, a flexible way of achieving the aims set.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report suggests that the Commission should draw up an action plan or other system for a market-based instrument for the environment. I have a question for the Commission: can it tell us what stage it has reached in its discussions and whether the consultation results available to it at the moment will reinforce or amend the proposals in the Green Paper? I believe that is a very important question.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the implementation of the market-based instruments, we must be guided by certain principles. We must, of course, apply the 'polluter pays' principle, ensure that the market-based instruments complement each other and complement other instruments, and that they are consistent and appropriate to the areas covered. That is the aim. In other words, we must not be systematic, but must show a great deal of ingenuity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to specific instruments, which I do not have time to discuss here, I must emphasise that Parliament is sceptical about the proposal on biodiversity, for the simple reason that it seems to us difficult, if not impossible, to compensate for a fairly unusual ecosystem in another country.</p>
<p class="contents">As for internalisation of the costs, that is a principle on which we have to base ourselves and for which we have to take steps. At the moment, very little account is taken of the environmental costs of human activities, particularly industrial and economic activities, in other words, to use a more technical term, the external costs. The transport sector is a typical example.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that last June the Commission was to put forward a proposal for revision of the 'Eurovignette' directive, particularly by making the road transport charge variable. That principle of variability must be applied more and more when devising market-based instruments for the environment. The Commission is proposing a similar system for energy taxes, in which they would be made up of two components, an energy component and an environmental component.</p>
<p class="contents">If the revision of the directive achieves its purpose, it should also ensure that competitiveness with other means of transport is restored and that modes that emit less CO<span class="sub">2 </span>are used.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one point to which I should like to draw particular attention: the competitiveness of the European economy. Of course we agree on this, but we have to be careful. The question that arises here is whether inaction would have a social, economic and environmental cost, as well as a political cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last year, this Green Paper was presented together with Commissioner Dimas with the purpose of launching a broad public debate on advancing the use of market-based instruments for environment and energy-related policy purposes in the Community. The Green Paper starts from the broadly shared view that not only market-based instruments, such as taxes, charges and tradable permit schemes, but also targeted subsidies, provide a flexible and cost-efficient means of reaching given policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament supports this approach. Equally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the view that market-based instruments cannot be seen and used in isolation and should be combined with regulatory instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report is a very useful and very comprehensive contribution to the discussion about the use of market-based instruments, both at Community and national level. Its scope is even broader, covering issues such as the greening of gross domestic product and the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. While these issues are obviously linked to the subject of the Green Paper and highly important in their own right, they were left out of the Green Paper, as they were covered in other Commission documents elaborated in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will take account of the numerous comments and requests made by Parliament in the context of its work on the various issues mentioned in the Green Paper and on further specific initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as imminent actions foreseen for this year are concerned, I can inform you that the Commission is planning to revise the Energy Taxation Directive in the autumn with the objective of ensuring that it contributes more effectively to meeting the EU energy and climate change targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, and in line with the request of Parliament, one of the main aspects will be to achieve better complementarity with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In my view, it is very important to provide for the best possible synergies between the revised EU Emissions Trading Scheme and energy taxation in such a way as to ensure that the EU meets its climate change and energy goals in the least costly way.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to present the proposal in time for Parliament to render an opinion before the end of its current mandate. There are areas where effective action can only be taken by legislation at EU level. This concerns, for example, the taxation of energy use – which I have just spoken about – and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, other areas where Member States can take effective action themselves and where they can cooperate and benefit from experiences gained in other Member States. To this end, the Green Paper suggests the creation of a forum on market-based instruments, which would allow knowledge to be shared across sectoral boundaries and Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate about the further use of market-based instruments, which is of use to all policymakers, whether here in Strasbourg, in Brussels or in the national capitals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our view, the emissions trading scheme (ETS) is the most cost-efficient, demand-sensitive and objective market-based instrument available for actually reaching the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20% by the year 2020. The ETS should be the cornerstone of the market-based instruments mix, and I welcome the Commission’s proposals to improve and expand it. The scheme should have a progressively tightening cap designed to reach that 20% objective in 2020. It should also be spread as widely as possible among significant emitters.</p>
<p class="contents">Auctioning should be the main means of allocating emissions targets, in order to avoid the disadvantages for competition of grandfathering. Auctioning is more economically efficient. It encourages new entrants, innovation and technological and operational improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Commissioner, I particularly stress that we feel that energy taxation, indeed taxes and subsidies in general, should remain only a very secondary and complementary greenhouse gas reduction tool for these emissions that cannot be covered directly or indirectly by the Emissions Trading Scheme. For this reason, we find paragraph 26 of the report inconsistent with the overall message of giving priority to the Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission must urgently negotiate reciprocal agreements with other jurisdictions. Mutual and equivalent international commitments covering sectors that are vulnerable to competition would be greatly preferable to the adoption of border tax adjustments to offset trade distortions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, greater use of market-based instruments is crucial, as they are cost-effective means to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">These indirect taxes, tradable permits and subsidies, I think, will assist the European Union to achieve its emissions targets. However, while recognising that Member States need to retain flexibility over their own tax systems, any tool or aid that can support our industries and consumers to make greener choices is to be welcomed, and our policies must be such that they incentivise behavioural change.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is imperative that market failures are corrected and that we have carbon-based pricing to reflect environmental damage as part of the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Reduced VAT on environmentally friendly products can assist the vulnerable in society, especially the elderly, who are now more than ever at risk of energy poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, any revenues raised through auctioning should be reinvested to tackle energy poverty and fund further environmental programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that our current economic model fails to integrate environmental costs into market prices. Already at the Stockholm Conference in 1972 the ‘polluter pays’ principle was established and agreed upon. But, as we know, it has not been implemented in most countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is very important. It responds to the many market failures we experience in several areas, where of course climate change is the most obvious problem today. The report suggests plenty of initiatives in many key areas. In general most of those proposals are well-drafted. However, I think more effort could have been made by us all to try to shorten the report and merge some of the individual paragraphs; very similar demands are now being put forward. I think the report would have benefited and become much clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group and as has already been said by Mr Purvis, I have to mention that we have difficulties with a few paragraphs. One is paragraph 26. You cannot favour an emissions trading system and at the same time ask for a general CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax at European level. It is inconsistent. Secondly, we have some problems with paragraph 24. While we agree with most of the contents, it is, in our opinion, too general in its language and somehow gives the impression that auctioning revenues would be or should be part of the EU budget in the future. That is not something we can support. But, apart from that, we are in general in support and once again congratulations to Ms Ferreira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot reconcile ourselves to casino capitalism – so-called development, but accompanied by the destruction of natural values. The twentieth century showed us that utopias are bound to fail without proper economic and social frameworks. The environmental basis of the ‘green tax’ and the whole tax policy can help create a better world to live in by providing a market economy and sustainable instruments. As for the increased imposition of taxes on raw materials, a single energy tax could compel everyone to reduce their dependence on energy imports, use their cars less, and invest in public transport, trams and railways. If the taxation balance was shifted from wages to consumption, a very new kind of workplace would develop and a lifestyle closer to nature and culture would have a bigger part to play, instead of consumer madness. The imposition of tax on harmful emissions and non-recyclable waste will reduce environmental pollution and the endemic diseases that accompany it, and so reduce the number of premature and unnecessary deaths. A switch-over to green taxation will be acceptable as a form of peaceful revolution. Of course, the level of taxation will not rise, as Europe is already too heavily taxed. A reduction in energy consumption would enhance the competitiveness of our goods. With green taxation, we can make the leap from the generally materialistic world of the twentieth century to a more sensible world, richer in environmentally friendly and human values. If there is one thing on which we, the European representatives of 27 countries, can all agree, it is green taxation. Let us make the world different, but through carefully considered and bold reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, the machinery is jammed and – to put it nicely and euphemistically – we have to get it started again, because it is time to get into a virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="contents">I see two courses of action. The first is to support the European Commission, which is in favour of payment for emission quotas. The second starts from the idea that the present system relating only to CO<span class="sub">2</span> is too narrow, and that other air pollutants will have to be incorporated gradually, starting no doubt with NOx and SO<span class="sub">2</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wonder about the favourable arrangements that still apply to the shipping sector. Unlike the situation that will soon apply in the aviation sector, it is not subject to any Community or international legislation on CO<span class="sub">2</span> reduction, a double standard that we can no longer afford.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cornerstone of the resolution is green taxation, environmental taxes, the revolution that Mr Eguy mentioned. The position of the Liberals and Democrats on that question is clear. Instruments based on the Community market should not be confined to the system of exchanging emission rights. We have to consider other systems and, as author, I am very much in favour of paragraph 27, which revives the idea of introducing a 'carbon' tax to offset a reduction in fossil fuel subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand – and I agree with Mr Purvis and Mr Wittman on this point – the ALDE Group will not support the last sentence of paragraph 26, which asks the Commission to submit a proposal on this Community CO<span class="sub">2 </span>tax by the end of 2008. We prefer the Union to complete its ambitious package of 'energy and climate' legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have to stop being hypocritical and be very aware of the cost of our ambition. If CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions are to be cut by a third, for example, every person in European must emit eight times less carbon dioxide. These blunt statistics show that, over and above the use of these market-based instruments to protect the environment, we cannot escape our own personal responsibility, and the Union will need to work very hard to stay on course, so that sustainable development is not just a fad but the model for all of us in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taking global responsibility to combat climate change is a crucial task that has to be achieved at various levels: not just in the world of enterprises and institutions, but among individuals as well. As European citizens, we can substantially reduce our ecological footprint and achieve major results simply by means of small measures, including our purchasing choices, that can have a global and significant impact. The Member States can encourage, or make it easier for, people to choose ecological products through market-based instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as promoting research into new technologies it is important to ensure that these technologies are made available to consumers and disseminated widely enough to bring about environmental benefits for the community. It is a pity that 16 countries representing the planet’s largest economies, meeting in Paris on 16 and 18 April, did not manage to reach agreement on a joint resolution aiming to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are hopeful that the subsequent negotiations in Kobe and Hokkaido will lead to more success in this area, especially as I believe that climate change has to be combated at a global level; otherwise, it will merely place a heavy burden on European enterprises causing them to become less competitive than their rivals from outside Europe without achieving the aim of an environmental improvement at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to use market-based instruments as economic levers if we are to move towards environmentally friendly production systems that are sustainable in the long term; in that respect, I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper. The European Union has to foster the dissemination in the Member States of market-based instruments that make it possible to internalise the environmental costs of products and to promote energy efficiency and the thermal insulation of buildings. I consider that it is essential for the European Union to achieve the goal of 20% of consumption from renewable sources by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the EU is actually going to live up to the many fine words spoken in connection with our targets for the climate and the environment, it is crucial that we politicians take responsibility and make the difficult decisions of behalf of our electorate. One of the effective tools that we have at our disposal is to limit consumption levels that create pressure on the environment by making the polluter pay. This is an excellent principle that everyone is agreed on but that has so far not been taken seriously in cases where it really does cost the polluter. For example, motorists’ costs have never been reflected in the cost of transport. One of the first things that we should do is to internalise what are popularly referred to as ‘external costs’. This would be a significant step forwards. It is of course also possible to go further in controlling the consumption of polluting substances through even tougher financial means, and let me say here that I simply do not understand why it is not possible to combine CO2 charges with an emission trading scheme. I simply do not understand this.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of an environmentally sound pricing policy is an effective way of using the market within environmental policy, not as a substitute for mandatory requirements and bans, but alongside them; this has also been suggested by the Commission. Concerns are often raised that the use of these market-based methods could have a skewed social impact. However, there is a need to be aware of hypocrisy. Consumption taxes usually have a fair impact, as the richest are also those who consume the most and who therefore pay the most. If there is a desire to do something about the difficulties being experienced by the poor in paying for essential consumption, there are many other methods that can be used which do not involve green taxes. For example, ordinary taxation, social and wage policies are much more appropriate if we take our responsibility for caring for the less well off seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">One method that will not work here is based on the establishment of a type of basic consumption that is made cheaper or even free. Firstly, consumption will always be relatively high; however, the worst aspect of the model is that it does not provide any incentive to make savings. Thus, in spite of everything, progressive taxation using green taxes is better. However, the very best thing to do is to keep these market-based instruments free of other considerations if they are really to be effective in the battle to save the environment, climate and nature. It is a good thing that concern for social distortion is so great; however, in this case it is a question of saving our living space for our descendents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent report and it has my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first make a personal comment. We are talking about market-based instruments here. Personally I am tired of the talk of market-based instruments in environmental policy. We do not need any more influence from companies or the market. We need more political control. We need more planning. We need, for example, tougher emissions requirements, we should be able to use public procurement for environmental purposes and environmental taxes and charges. It is in fact here that we have market-based instruments, because it is all about introducing taxes and charges on things which exacerbate environmental problems, internalising environmental problems in other words. These instruments are a good example of how we take political responsibility for environmental problems instead of leaving it to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give some concrete examples of particularly important aspects in this report. A minimum tax on CO<span class="sub">2</span>, a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax combined with a clear reduction requirement, is likely to be the most effective way of getting emissions down. My own country was the first in the world to introduce a CO<span class="sub">2 </span>tax. That was in the early 1990s. Without claiming that Sweden is at the forefront in all climate areas, the CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax has actually been one of the main reasons behind the reduction in our CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. It is high time that more countries did the same. In paragraph 26 of this report we call for precisely such a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax.</p>
<p class="contents">In general we call for more support for Member States to introduce environmental taxes. I believe today that there is an entirely unique opportunity to push for a CO<span class="sub">2</span> tax and other environmental taxes. In the most recent years, awareness has increased enormously worldwide. In the report we also state that the Member States themselves determine this area. Of course this is entirely correct. It is within their field of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the Emission Trading Scheme. We have to admit that the first trading period 2005–2007 has been nothing other than disastrous. The scheme has not succeeded in reducing emissions and many polluters have even received overly generous allocations and made huge profits from this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we therefore call for auctioning of emission permits, we demand an emissions cap which is consistent with the reduction target of 30%, and restrictions and tough requirements for the use of flexible mechanisms. It is hoped that doing this will enable the trading scheme to start working. If this does not succeed, we should consider replacing the trading scheme with something else entirely, for example steep taxes on emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is important to remember that now that aviation is to be included in emissions trading, we can no longer limit anti-aviation measures to the trading system alone. Parallel measures such as a tax on air fuel and charges on nitrogen oxide emissions, NO<span class="sub">x</span>, are a must, and this is precisely what we are calling for in this report. Here I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Commission a question: You previously said that you would present measures against airline nitrogen dioxide emissions, against NO<span class="sub">x</span>, and that this would happen this year. Can you tell us what is happening with that? Do you have a date when these measures will be in place? Considering the fact that air transport has almost doubled its emissions in recent years, many of us here would like to see concrete measures. We really cannot wait any longer!</p>
<p class="contents">These instruments are a good example of how we are taking political responsibility for climate change. Taxes and charges enable us to speed up the necessary reductions in emissions and hopefully solve the entire climate problem. Let us do so! This is our duty to our children and all other living beings on this beautiful planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the pillars of the proposal before us is the 'polluter pays' principle. This is an important premise in that it allows for an equitable sharing of the burdens. This is also one reason why I am in favour of all external costs, and thus environmental costs too, being passed on to the consumers of manufactured and consumer goods. It makes for a realistic picture and fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In November of last year I attended the conference entitled <span class="italic">Beyond GDP</span>. A broad discussion was held there of ways in which indicators other than gross domestic product alone might be used to measure social wellbeing, because in practice social and environmental factors play a part here, as well as economic factors. You may be doing very nicely financially, but if you live in a densely populated city with too much air pollution, your quality of life is not all that wonderful. I am glad that Mrs Ferreira makes this point in her report too.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to express my support for two specific paragraphs in her report, paragraphs 58 and 59, on internalising environmental factors in the pricing of water and, secondly, a legislative framework to reduce the level of waste generated in the medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Business activity has ecological costs that are often not taken into consideration in financial accounting. Despite the fact that the polluter pays principle, one of the pillars of the European Union’s environmental policy, is in force throughout the Community, its application in certain countries leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is introducing a series of items of legislation and rules to improve the state of the environment, and it is vital to introduce new market instruments. Economic taxes in the European Union could play a very significant role in achieving environmental protection objectives within the EU. So far, the only system in place is the emissions trading system for carbon dioxide. This would appear to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Other market instruments should be considered. It is very important that income from ecological taxes should be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment and on human health. It would seem that a gradual harmonisation of environmental taxes throughout the EU is essential. Ecological taxation in Member States is very varied. Leaving solutions for these issues in the hands of Member States runs the risk of distortions in competitiveness between companies.</p>
<p class="contents">When introducing new market instruments a number of basic guidelines have to be followed: the public have to accept them, the taxes cannot be seen as yet another obligation imposed by the European Union and also the taxes have to be introduced gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EU Member States already have their own market instruments, for example, energy saving certificates or green energy certificates. However, all Member States should give strong support to low-carbon technologies, energy saving and renewable technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the European Union is a leader in the area of environmental protection and I believe it has a responsibility to set an example to the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also remind you that we have known since the UN report entitled ‘Our Common Future’, which was prepared by Margot Wallström, that it is our responsibility to future generations, to our children and grandchildren, to leave the natural environment in the best possible condition.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of the European Union in this area is already very good, but the European Parliament is also keeping its finger on the pulse. We have a special temporary Committee on Climate Change, we have good legislation, and we enact regulations, directives and decisions. Now the time has come to strengthen other mechanisms, especially financial incentives and taxes, and also to step up information campaigns and preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">For these actions to be effective, there has to be a Community approach. Member States have to overcome their reluctance and their resistance to tax harmonisation, at least as far as the environment is concerned. Even though they are used for sensible purposes, ecological taxes are not at all popular at present. Just like all taxes, they are disliked. For this reason we have to make all possible efforts at European and national levels to make ecological payments and taxes socially acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need are activities that inspire a high level of ecological awareness. We need incentives that will ensure that good practices are used widely and will promote pro-ecological social behaviour. After all, no one complains when, in the European Parliament shop, we are asked to pay five cents for a plastic bag. This is of fundamental importance – not the financial dimension of this action, but the moment of reflection that accompanies it, when the customer thinks whether to take the plastic bag, or to leave it and reduce the amount of rubbish on the planet. This is a good way to make people think. People will accept financial charges, taxes and other environmental levies, but only when they believe they are sensible and can see a positive outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, make the point that no policy instrument is effective simply because it carries the label ‘market-based’.</p>
<p class="contents">All the instruments that we use to achieve policy objectives must meet certain criteria. For example, is the instrument appropriate to the given objective? If we confuse different objectives we will not achieve any of them properly. If part of the thinking behind an environmental measure is that it should be a means of making money, we are already on uncertain ground because the measure is liable to be distorted for a variety of reasons. Does a given instrument actually help to achieve an objective? That question needs to be closely – and regularly – examined. Is a given instrument compatible with others that already exist? What about efficiency – the relationship between cost and benefit?</p>
<p class="contents">Reading this report, I am doubtful in some cases whether the criteria I refer to have been met. Emissions trading systems work very well in theory but the reality is somewhat different. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is in a state of chaos. Fortunes have been wiped out and the actual aim of the scheme has not been achieved. Fair enough, you may say, this is the experimental phase and we have not yet got it right; but we certainly cannot afford much more of this expensive experimentation.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy on taxation of energy use also illustrates my point. Taxation really has no place in an EU Green Paper about market-based instruments. The mere fact that an instrument influences sections of the market does not make it market-based. I have no objection in principle to tax measures being used to achieve environmental objectives but I will support their introduction only if they meet the criteria I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">My case is that we should set out the objectives to be achieved; the choice of means to achieve them should then be left to those involved in the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The matters that have been discussed in some detail are aimed just at the future. The question is: according to the polluter pays principle, who is to clean the soil, water and air that have been polluted by past industrial waste or by outdated pesticides, asbestos, phosphorus pentachloride and other compounds?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the green bonds referred to in paragraph 67 would be very good for this purpose. Companies involved in this process could be allocated tasks that had not otherwise been dealt with and would carry them out with the help of the financial markets. The introduction of such bonds, which could be called green bonds, would make it possible to resolve many problems associated with the introduction of market-based instruments into the area of environmental protection.

<p class="contents">Market instruments clearly have a role to play. Making economic logic align with environmental and social reality by applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be a powerful way of steering patterns of production and consumption towards sustainability. For example, if the true environmental and social costs of freight transport were internalised within prices paid along the supply chain, we might finally see an end to the madness that sees more or less identical products being pointlessly traded back and forth between distant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying such principles at the level of individuals via a system of personal carbon trading could be an extremely effective way of influencing consumer behaviour. But, as Ms Ferreira’s report rightly makes clear, market instruments must not be seen as a replacement for other forms of environmental standards and regulation. Their usefulness also depends crucially on the way in which they are designed.</p>
<p class="contents">The emissions trading system is a case in point. I would like to warn colleagues that, if we listen to a lot of what the industry is telling us, we will end up with a scheme that is no more than trading backwards and forwards for the sake of trading, as we have seen with the first two phases, completely losing sight of any environmental objectives. To be effective, the scheme has to have a tough cap deriving from the 30% emissions reduction target, restrictions on the entry of outside credits and full auctioning of allowances from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention one other welcome thread running through the report – the recognition that traditional economic growth as measured by GDP is no longer an adequate or accurate measure of true well-being. A conference was held on this topic in Parliament earlier this year and I look forward to the Commission’s report in the autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, cross-border environmental pollution in Europe cannot be tackled at national level, and this gives the EU a clear role here. Secondly, the EU is the world’s largest economy, with enormous production and foreign trade, and the Member States are united in taking responsibility for the environmental consequences of this fact. This combination of size and agreement on fundamental environmental targets gives the EU the opportunity to exercise a global influence which can be of major importance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report does not inspire trust. It makes no distinction between consumption of finite resources and impact on climate. The rapporteur also shamelessly uses the climate question as an argument for supranationalism, bureaucracy and protectionism, making an all-out call for joint taxation, a review of the notion of free competition and tariff increases. There is no realisation that countries must seek solutions in competition with each other. Then to cap it all, there is the usual officious statement that we must adopt a new lifestyle in our western societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Appalling! Our job is to ensure that the environmental costs of consumption are reflected in the prices consumers pay. Free citizens choose their lifestyles for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This young student was very worried about climate change and was asking us how far we could go. It was an expression of the distress felt by idealistic young people who expect a lot of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we have market-based instruments that have been put in place: the Community system for the exchange of greenhouse gas emission quotas, and the 'Eurovignette' directive in the transport sector. These instruments have certain advantages because they set a value on environmental costs and help towards the achievement of environmental targets, at a lower cost, and they encourage businesses to make a longer-term commitment, which ultimately sustains employment. These instruments can help to reduce the damaging effects that environmental taxes could have on competitiveness in some sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of sustainable development and the efforts to combat climate change should not be just a deterrent, through taxes and charges, but also an incentive, by facilitating a quicker transition to virtuous and eco-friendly behaviour. Everyone has to make the effort; that is why environmental costs need to be internalised.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be stressed that environmental taxes should not be regarded as a way of increasing tax revenue, but as a means of preventing all harmful pollution and damage to the environment, at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in future debates on the 'energy-climate' package in the European Parliament, we shall have to give serious consideration to putting in place a border adjustment instrument, which will in particular help avoid any carbon leaks. We need to fulfil the obligation to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, whilst preserving economic competitiveness. In that connection, I emphasise the importance of the 'carbon' tax. That is often a taboo subject, but I still think it is worthwhile and should be considered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report makes this clear in an excellent way. To protect the environment is cheaper than to rehabilitate it, but the failure to use fair market tools means to provide hidden subsidies to polluters. The green toolbox needs flexibility if we are to have certainty and make sure we do not default on other indicators and increase the burden for citizens. Trade instruments need to be combined with promoting investment in new technology, with offsetting instruments for overcoming deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual countries do matter. Bulgaria, for example, will be facing problems in the future. The closing down of certain parts of the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy lead to an increase in generation at thermal power plants, electricity prices went up. This increases emissions, yet the low GHG allowances work like penalties and consumers are paying the increased price. Unless carbon dioxide allowance are reallocated and in the absence of sufficient compensation to off-set the decommissioned power units, the application of the other trade instruments will bring about more problems. Environmental economics has its social dimensions and we should not wait until 2010 or 2013 before we act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Avoiding deforestation should also be at the core of the EU climate change mitigation strategy, as a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions fairly quickly. Avoiding deforestation can be achieved only by a mix of regulatory approach and market-based instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil society has repeatedly exposed the way the EU actively contributes to global deforestation by allowing illegal timber to freely enter its market. It is vital that the EU introduces legislation to ensure that only timber and timber products from legal sources are placed on the EU market. This regulatory approach should be complemented by a set of market-based instruments specifically designed for forestry, such as charges for premature harvesting of forests or incentives for sustainable forest management. However, in order to use market-based instruments more widely in forestry, we need to clarify which instruments work best, to what extent they can be used and how they can be correlated with regulatory law.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to present an analysis of the most appropriate market-based instruments for the forestry sector, and to outline the suitable context for these instruments to be used and combined with other policy tools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the way that the burden associated with counteracting climate change has been allocated within the European Union framework is highly unfair. For example, carbon dioxide emission limits were allocated to individual Member States without taking into account the backwardness in their development, which, in Poland among other countries, has resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of electricity and, as a result, a visible jump in the costs of production and also living costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the implementation of the climate package, according to the estimates of the European Commission itself, will come to about EUR 50 billion per annum. In a situation where the majority of the fastest growing nations of the world, such as China, India and Brazil, as well as economic powerhouses such as the United States, are not too bothered about climate change, it could well happen that the European economy will stop being competitive in world markets, which means it will be necessary to introduce instruments to protect European output, burdened as it is by such high additional costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed carbon dioxide emission charges punish the consequences but do not address the cause. The promotion of clean sources of energy, such as water, wind, solar power and atomic energy, together with stability in their prices, would have a significant impact for society, the economy and environmental protection and should be an area where systemic measures are undertaken.

I will try to comment on some of the comments made.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ferreira commented on the lack of information about the replies to our debate. I would like to inform you that we received 170 replies, which are being analysed at the moment, and we hope to have a summary of these replies by the end of the summer, in which case we shall, of course, provide you with this summary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman raised the point of inconsistency between emission trading systems and the carbon tax. I would like to say that, in the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, one of the objectives is precisely to deal with and tackle any possible inconsistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Two Members raised the issue of possible border tax adjustments to prevent carbon leakage in case international negotiations fail. I would like to say that the main and priority goal of the Commission is to reach a successful post-Kyoto international agreement to address climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of tax on air kerosene, the issue has already been discussed with the Member States. It proved to be a very sensitive issue and no progress was made. Two Member States apply a tax of this type, but I must point out that it also raises questions of international law. The Commission does not intend to submit any proposal for such a tax.</p>
<p class="contents">On the use of reduced VAT rates to achieve environmental goals, the Commission services are currently studying the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that a number of the comments made by honourable Members fall within the work of different Commissioners. I have taken note of all your comments and I shall convey them to the Commissioners concerned.

We appreciate that the taxation debate is not closed and I should like just to mention three points at this stage in the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the proportion accounted for by energy taxes. On average they represent 76% of environmental taxation, compared with 21% for transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, domestic consumers, who have to pay by far the largest proportion of environmental taxes, when other sectors of the economy are the biggest consumers of energy, water and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the proportion of GDP of Member States represented by environmental taxes has declined over the past five years. That gives us something else to think about in our future deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly regret what the EPP is asking for on paragraph 26, in which we were proposing a minimum Community tax on CO<span class="sub">2</span>. It seems to me that we need to continue along that path if we want to prevent dumping in the European Union. The idea is not to take over tax powers from the Member States, it is to have minimum tax harmonisation. That is necessary and it has been underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the fact that Member States are asking for further progress towards tax coordination, I should also like to draw attention to another point in the report. The reduction in taxes on employment cannot be linked only to the reduction in environmental taxes, as the Commission is proposing. In my view, it should be part of a more general reform, with principles of solidarity and social justice. I am well aware that that is not yet a competence of the States, but let us think about it here and give the Member States some information.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I think is important is the domestic dimension. The measures we take here should not have an adverse effect on households that are already on low incomes and make the position of other households more insecure.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to say in conclusion. Thank you, Commissioner; I can assure you of our support in drawing up future legislation on these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel more focus should be given to market-based environmental protection incentives. We believe that the concepts of the market, competition and protection of the environment are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">The significance of market incentives is that the aim of environmental quality can be achieved more cheaply and more effectively with them, and other social objectives can be achieved at the same time. Unfortunately, the European Union has not done much to encourage market-based incentives, though the emissions trading scheme could be given as an exception. It is therefore comforting that the Green Paper contains a survey of hidden opportunities for these topical incentives. We might add, however, that the survey should have gone a lot further.</p>
<p class="contents">A wider use of market-based regulation should go hand in hand with a reduction in ineffective direct regulation. Since economic incentives are income-generating, we have to examine just how these instruments, primarily imposed on labour, can generate taxes. This subject warrants intensive debate. We are also convinced that the EU’s ambitious environment policy objectives cannot be fulfilled without going further in the field of market incentives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title6"></a><a name="creitem6"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alexander Radwan, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. − <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, the subject matter of the report before us would seem, at first glance, to be highly technical. It concerns so-called accounting standards in the European Union and worldwide, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. It may very well be the type of subject that is discussed now in the European Parliament and then takes several years to begin to affect the economy and ordinary people. At that stage the cry will go up that nobody knows where these standards come from or who is responsible for them. Nor will anyone know why they have to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to achieve a single set of global accounting standards, particularly for public limited companies. We support that objective. The argument we hear advanced for it is that we need ‘high quality standards’, and this House considers itself the only forum empowered to set those high quality standards. However, in these times of turbulence on the financial markets, it is astonishing to hear the same people who previously argued for the principle of ‘fair value’ now questioning that principle and asking, too, whether a ‘market to market’ approach still makes sense if we no longer have a market. The very people who let the genie out of the bottle are the ones now asking whether we are on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">The only people responsible for these standards are the people sitting in the offices of this private organisation in London, who are undoubtedly influenced in making their standards by the desire to keep themselves in a job. My report, on which we are to vote today, therefore concerns not just the impact on small and medium-sized companies, but also the fundamental question of who makes rules for whom, and who supervises the application of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue to address is that of governance: how transparent is this organisation? In other words, how transparent is its funding? There are certainly hidden interests here. The members of this committee, who are demanding transparency and always try to portray the market as transparent, should make at least a modicum of effort to comply themselves with the transparency requirements they lay down for the market! My impression so far is that this organisation fights with every means at its disposal to avoid transparency in any form.</p>
<p class="contents">Who takes the decisions about financing and the choice of personnel for specific posts? Why are individuals appointed? Is it about regional balance? Is it about inter-sector balance? The current project concerns IFRS for small and medium-sized companies, so it is fair to ask who represents small and medium-sized companies. Who knows about small and medium-sized companies? And another thing: why are IFRS for small and medium-sized companies actually on the agenda right now? Who sets the agenda?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner McCreevy and Sir David Tweedie have also been asked many times, over a number of years, why we are actually doing this. Several years down the line we now know why we are discussing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies in Europe: it is because of requests from South Africa and Brazil. What a marvellous answer! We know quite well that the focus of all this is not South Africa or Brazil, but rather the European market, where there will be a lot of money to be made if SMEs are required to introduce something like this. So these are the issues at stake in the matter of governance – and some initial, positive steps have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">But all the bodies that are to be set up in the future will be assessed according to whether the people who belong to this supervisory organisation and have to answer questions about it at political level – and they could include a Member of the Commission – will also have the power to shape new developments. It is not enough for them simply to be notified of proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our aims is convergence. We must take care, however, that the interpretation of convergence does not slip from Europe’s grasp, to be replaced by the SEC’s interpretation. In Europe today we are sufficiently familiar with the way the US stock exchange is supervised. We should not be so naïve as to leave the business of supervision to the Americans. What we want is therefore what we have already called for: IFRS as Europe understands them and not as this board dictates.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized companies are the ones affected here, and I have to say, without mincing my words, that the ideas on the table today are too complicated and too difficult. I would also warn against taking the voluntary approach. I am wearing my Bavarian national costume today and a good old Bavarian term comes to mind here: it is ‘<span class="italic">hinterfotzig</span>’ and it means something like ‘through the back door’. We know very well – despite all the denials and the acquiescence – that IFRS for small and medium-sized companies will be introduced to the European market through the back door, via a small number of Member States. We will then hear the same voices calling for a single set of standards, and they will proceed to foist their standards on the market – standards which are too complex, which nobody understands and nobody wants – purely because there is a market opportunity. What we have here is a case of a minority trying to impose its will on a majority at global level, and it is unacceptable! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It raises important issues for the future development of European and indeed global capital markets. In this brief intervention I cannot address all the issues raised in the report. Let me therefore focus on three points. One, governance issues; secondly the EU’s input to the International Accounting Standards Board, the IASB; and thirdly the project to develop an accounting standard for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">On IASB governance, your report rightly highlights the fact that our shared objective is to develop high-quality global accounting standards. The EU’s decision to require listed companies to use international accounting standards was a bold and visionary step towards this objective. A single set of globally accepted accounting standards would provide significant benefits for our companies, our capital markets and our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continuously strive to ensure that international accounting standards remain relevant in the face of changing economic circumstances and that they represent the interests of all stakeholders in a balanced manner. To ensure that these conditions can continue to be met, progress should be made as a matter of priority in three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the accountability of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation (IASCF), needs to be enhanced, in particular towards public authorities. The latter should play an active role in the selection and appointment of trustees. In this respect, the proposal that I, together with my counterparts in the US SEC, the Japanese FSA and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, made last November goes in the direction advocated by your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to look at how the IASB’s agenda-setting process can be improved. In particular, the process through which priorities are set needs to be made more open and more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the IASB’s due process should be enhanced, mainly by ensuring that standards are subject to a full impact assessment before they are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report makes constructive suggestions about these and related points. The forthcoming review of the IASCF’s constitution provides the opportunity to implement the necessary reforms. The committee will pursue them in consultation with this House, the Member States and our international partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, turning to the EU’s input to the IASB. Your report argues that the EU needs to strengthen its capacity to make its views on accounting matters heard at the international level. I agree. In particular we should seek means to ensure that the views of European stakeholders, especially proactive input to the IASB’s agenda-setting process, can be put to the IASB in a more timely and coherent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary process. We should build on the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group and I am ready to pursue this as a matter of urgency, including the possibility of using funding from the Community budget to support such a structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, sound a clear and unambiguous warning. This structure will in no circumstances become an embryonic European standard-setter, nor can there be any question of developing European interpretations of international accounting standards. Europe must and will remain part of the movement towards a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. Anything else would damage the international competitiveness of our companies and our capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the IASB’s project to develop an accounting standard for SMEs, let me begin by stating that the Commission currently has no legal basis to endorse this standard. Moreover, we have never made any commitment to take over whatever standard the IASB produces. We would only do so if we were genuinely convinced that the IASB produces a standard that meets the interests of European users.</p>
<p class="contents">The IASB has not yet finalised its project. However, at this stage the Commission’s views are clear. The current exposure draft published by the IASB remains too complex to provide a satisfactory accounting framework for European SMEs, especially for smaller companies. Our focus remains the simplification of the regulatory environment for SMEs, including in the accounting area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, during Parliament’s last term, we decided, on the Legal Affairs Committee’s proposal, to adopt the IAS Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate aim – as Alexander Radwan has said – was indeed to achieve convergence, at least with the USA and if possible worldwide. The system makes no sense in the case of small and medium-sized companies because, as a rule, they have no need of international financial markets, no need of Wall Street and the rest. For that reason alone, the necessity of developing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies is highly questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that – and I think Commissioner McCreevy was entirely right here – the current proposal is for nothing more than a slimmed-down version of what are, by any measure, extremely complicated international standards, entirely unsuited to the structure of small and medium-sized companies in Europe. They are particularly ill-suited to family companies, which have been run by their owners for several generations; which have already written off property belonging to them; and in which the application of fair-value rules would simply encourage greed and, in the end, could very well jeopardise the companies’ chances of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must be realistic. Ultimately, the question of accounting standards for SMEs in Europe will not be exempt from some form of pressure for harmonisation. Our demand is for comparability, at least within the Single Market. So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London, with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too – but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term, rather than short-term valuation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one further point to make about the IAS bodies. There is a real problem here, as Alexander Radwan has outlined. There may be a certain geographical balance but there is no balance in terms of economic weight. Europe is by far the largest bloc, the largest region in which the IAS rules apply. That is why we must have a commensurate say, and we simply cannot be compared with somewhere like Australia. Australia carries the same weight as a middle-sized EU country or, indeed, a big region like North Rhine-Westphalia. The balance needs to be improved in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was under discussion up to the very last minute. In its final form it is a report that is clear, but sometimes critical too. The rapporteur is convinced that the IASB's democratic accountability has to be improved and I am glad to see the IASB taking this criticism on board.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of the Trustees, Mr Gerrit Zalm, indicated recently in the European Parliament that he was open to suggestions and ready to put forward proposals on adapting the structure. The IASB is working on IFRS standards for small and medium enterprises. I agree with the rapporteur that IFRS are too complex and too expensive for SMEs. I also believe that encouraging the voluntary use of IFRS by SMEs would carry the risk of them being introduced into Europe by the back door. In my view there has to be differentiation according to company size. It is a good thing to have big multinationals, banks and insurance companies which operate worldwide producing their annual accounts to a single standard. But small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe should have their own standard.</p>
<p class="contents">The IASB has achieved much in respect of internationally listed companies and accounting standards for them. If SMEs are now saying that cost and effort can be just as well managed using more than one standard, we cannot have a single standard being imposed from the top down. It is also very important that the interests of investors and of transparency should be considered too. Policy is there to facilitate, to ensure that there is sound, transparent and cost-effective information on business performance. I think the proven benefits of IFRS can also benefit European equity markets, certainly if the Americans exchange their US GAAP system for IFRS. Comparability here can be very beneficial to international investors and stakeholders. The idea behind IFRS thus deserves to be supported by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you also to the rapporteur, in your Bavarian costume. I think we worked very well together, and the way in which it was possible for various people’s amendments to be incorporated in your report is proof of that.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to make three points about accounting standards. It seems to me that, in terms of the governance and operation of the body responsible for setting these accounting standards, we are in an unusual situation. There are many forms of standardisation. Not all of them have such a strong impact on financial stability, or on the issues, in terms of power and governance, as accounting standards have. What is happening today is an important event, a passage to adulthood.</p>
<p class="contents">When these accounting standards were formulated, perhaps by auditors who worked amongst themselves, they basically prepared the ground very well. Nowadays these accounting standards are international. They are used and applied by everyone and so the question of governance is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the body responsible for setting these accounting standards fit in with international governance, in relation to democratic bodies, bodies that legitimately represent State power, and the European Union in particular?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point we need to look at in regard to governance is of course the balance between those bodies. What is the geographical balance, what is the balance in the representation not just of those who draw up the standards, but also of those who will have to use them?</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is financing. How are these bodies to be financed? Might the idea of a levy on businesses, which would be coordinated by regulatory bodies, be worthwhile? Could they be financed by government, by the European Community? We hope that the Commissioner will be making some strong proposals on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question in regard to those bodies is the programme. Is it right for them to develop the concept of fair value when we know the effects that can have on financial stability? Is it right for this body to develop an SME programme that Europe does not need? Is it right that, on this issue of standards for SMEs – just because, as our rapporteur has said, South Africa or Australia might need them – the Commissioner did not make sure that Europe had a say in those bodies. It is absolutely essential, as a first step, that Europe should make sure it is there to represent the strength of all the Member States and the voice of Europeans, in the IASB, the IASCF and IFRIC. Commissioner, that is your responsibility. We are expecting strong proposals from you on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This brings with it a need to strengthen accountability and transparency of the IASB, which may not have been so obvious at its inception. I welcome moves in that direction, but I regret that some parts of this report present criticism in a negative way, rather than acknowledging changes that are under way and pointing the way forward. So several of my amendments aim to be more forward-looking, highlighting the advantages and benefits, alongside the need for further adaptation, both to the standards themselves and the IASB that oversees them. However, unnecessary politicisation of technical issues must be avoided. IFRSs are an important tool for advancing comparability across borders and reducing burdensome requirements for companies reporting under different regimes, but it would be useful if presentation of financial statements lent itself more easily to other comparison purposes. However, it may well be the case that tools such as XBRL tagging can develop that. I have to thank Ms van den Burg for organising an interesting presentation on that subject last week.</p>
<p class="contents">The SME proposals cause concern in several quarters. To me they look more like a tool for medium entities, perhaps on their way to full public reporting, so they may merit their own separate consideration in that light or on a voluntary basis. But – as you have said, Commissioner – as yet they are far too complex for the majority of ordinary SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope the Bavarian national dress he is wearing here this morning is not indicative of a change in political direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the IFRSs in January 2005 has brought great benefits to the European Union by making accountancy requirements simpler across borders and financial statements easier to compare across countries, competitors and industries, enhancing the work of regulatory oversight, banking and capital markets. International financial reporting standards are now being used or are being adopted in more than a hundred countries, including Australia, South Africa and others.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the calls for increased transparency, effectiveness and accountability over the IASB. The report points to the fact that 17 months had passed before the IASB appointed a new chairperson. This cannot be acceptable. The IASB is a private, self-regulatory body which has been given the role of rule-maker and it is only right that we demand increased accountability and oversight because of that. We should also be careful about calling for the establishment of extra EU structures to deal with the interpretation and application of IFRS standards. Why is it needed? What will it do?</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of EU-US convergence, there has been great progress made in this area and in the EU-US accounting road map. Last year, the US President, the President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the European Commission signed a joint EU-US statement which undertook to promote and to seek to ensure conditions for the US generally accepted accounting principles and the IFRSs to be recognised in both jurisdictions. This is very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the application of the IFRSs to SMEs, SMEs are small and smaller. I feel it might be better to make it optional so as to ensure flexibility, rather than prevent its application outright. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I appreciate that our aspirations place us in a quandary. On the one hand we want these international standards, applicable worldwide, but on the other hand we insist on our authority as co-legislator to judge the substance of those standards and to discharge our duty as co-legislator responsibly. I think the European Parliament has shown latterly that it does that.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind the key lies in timely consultation, in a balanced consideration of the interests of all stakeholders, including third-party interests of employees, local authorities, suppliers and so on (because adequate financial reporting benefits more than just money providers alone), and a sound assessment of the consequences. The Commission has a weighty responsibility here. And in the immediate future these things must be done on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises. We can make this a really worthwhile project for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have two comments which are also relevant to another report which we shall be voting on in our next part-session, Mr Lehne's report on a simplified business environment for companies. Here too I have taken the line that rules are not just for companies, money providers and the accountants who earn their living from them, but also for employees and other groups. So we must not meddle with the quality of the rules. I have advocated that the rules should in any event be applied to delisted companies and off-balance activities. I hope you will agree that there is also work for the IASB to do in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by repeating my heartfelt endorsement of the XBRL standard. As you are aware, the US SEC is about to take a decision making this mandatory. I urge you to think about how Europe should respond to this, and encourage you to draw up a roadmap for Europe accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Steps have been taken and more are planned: publication of feedback statements, explaining the reasoning behind its decisions, pushing cost-benefit analyses and enlargement and more active involvement of the board of trustees. It bent over backwards to communicate with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan’s report is much improved from earlier versions and I believe the positive amendments from the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups will further improve the text today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur because, although we have had our differences, he was willing to compromise in certain areas on this governance aspect. Unfortunately, I am unable to agree with him on the issue of International Financial Reporting Standards for SMEs. The IASB was asked to draw up a simplified version for SMEs. Mr Radwan’s report declines to acknowledge that this could also be useful in the European Union. In fact, with the proposal still only at the drafting stage, the report proclaims that it will definitely not benefit EU companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we have been told repeatedly that it will be optional and is designed for those growing SMEs which aim to become public listed companies. Small enterprises with no aspirations beyond their local markets need not take it up. An opinion survey last September found that a clear majority of European SMEs, including German SMEs, considered the benefits outweighed any disadvantages and would improve financial reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the IASB to develop global accounting standards of a high quality are a major and welcome contribution to the European and world economies and, frankly, I think we should be applauding them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">About 100 countries are using the standards and their globalisation has provided comparability and transparency, thereby increasing the confidence of operators, creating a more level playing field and strengthening market discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal contains two great challenges relating to governance. On the one hand, the private entity, which has been setting worldwide voluntary standards since 1973 on a corporate and professional basis, now finds itself in a position of huge responsibility entailing a change in its nature, procedures and composition in order that it can become a transparent, controllable institution, with a legitimacy reflecting its new role.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to recognise and coordinate the activities of all the public and private interests concerned and at the same time to secure the organisation’s financing and independence in the setting of standards. Furthermore, the organisation must be integrated into international governance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to strengthen European accounting governance by adopting a more proactive and integrated approach to the preparation, approval, implementation and assessment of standards. It is vital to improve the conceptual framework of standards, and to bear in mind that they are neither neutral nor academic and can produce both winners and losers. Likewise it is important to assess their effects and ensure their compatibility with European strategy, to learn from financial upheavals and to regulate the accounting standards of administrative concessions in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial accounting arrangements for SMEs will need to be simple and be linked to their exploitation of the internal and global market. These matters are covered by Mr Radwan’s report, which has achieved broad consensus and comes at a very opportune moment in terms of the upcoming review at the end of 2009, envisaging the creation of a supervisory body and altering the composition of the Standards Advisory Council before next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Several points emerge very clearly from what has been said. Firstly, we need a single set of standards for public limited companies, but we do not want to lump all companies together. Secondly, while we are not rejecting specific rules tailored to SMEs, the framework for those rules must be established by us, by the European Union. Thirdly, the measures currently proposed are too complex and too expensive, they are of no use to SMEs and for those reasons we must reject them. Fourthly, we are still awaiting satisfactory answers to the questions of who makes what rules for whom, and who supervises the process. There is no democratic legitimacy; there is no differentiation of approach; no account has been taken of the justifiable wishes of SMEs; and the system of democratic supervision is inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, in taking a stance on this issue or trying to answer these questions, it is often forgotten that two-thirds of the workforce are employed in the private sector in family-owned companies, and the majority of those family-owned companies are SMEs that do not seek finance from the capital markets. This is a point we need to remember when we are confronted with proposals that would treat all companies alike.</p>

<p class="contents">This being the case, it seems to me that another lesson of the crisis is that there is a certain asymmetry between the stated importance of accounting standards and the nature and operation of the private entities responsible for setting, producing and interpreting those standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Radwan’s report is therefore correct to point out that the first matter to be dealt with is that of governance. In my view he has put forward intelligent and realistic proposals about the need for the institutions representing the Union to be more proactive in this process of setting standards which are to be incorporated into the Community legal order, also concerning the internal operating rules of those private entities. Greater transparency, safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and broader geographical representation are some of the proposals which Mr Radwan has put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect dealt with in the report is the matter of small and medium-sized undertakings. We have emphasised here in the House the need to reconcile two objectives: simplification and reduced cost of accounting procedures for SMEs and the provision of adequate information for market players.</p>

The underlying premise here – and Mr Radwan pinpoints it in his report – is that an institution without a political mandate should nonetheless lay down a relatively large body of measures affecting the economy, some of which are binding. It is not enough to call for improved governance, or better framework conditions; political bodies also need to become more involved in this matter than they have been in the past. What we are doing here in Parliament constitutes a step in the right direction, but further steps must be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another aspect to consider. What is done here at the level of a regional organisation – in this case the European Union – should also be mirrored in the global context.

I do not find the description of the method of assessment and evaluation of realisable and non-realisable assets completely acceptable. That is why I doubt we should interfere, whether this is good or a bad method. We should wait for the experts to carry out the assessment. Meanwhile, the review of the standard of non-realisable assets and consultations on this issue has already started. Only then should we make our decision.

It was certainly a very wide-ranging debate with diversity of views on many of the issues and we have taken note of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise again that high-quality international accounting standards are crucial for the effective functioning of both the European and global capital markets. The process through which these standards are developed should therefore be subject to robust governance. It should be characterised by a high level of transparency and it should ensure a balanced consideration of stakeholder interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The IASCF and the IASB have over recent years implemented significant reforms of their internal procedures but I cannot deny that further improvements are necessary. Moreover, I recognise that we in Europe should better organise ourselves to guide and provide input to the IASB standard-setting process. In short, even if the IASB’s governance and due process were perfect, international accounting standards will only meet the needs of European stakeholders if their views are presented in a coherent, a convincing and a timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly all speakers referred to the question of IFRSs for SMEs and I repeat again that there is no legal basis for its endorsement in Europe at present. If we were to do so, it would need codecision with the European Parliament. Can I just repeat, as I have said many times about IFRSs for SMEs, when the IASB was going about this particular work I made it quite clear in a number of speeches that they should not assume that there was going to be automatic endorsement from the EU for this particular project. We would only recommend it if it was simple and effective and met the needs of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">They were told that when they were doing their work. Their first exposure draft has been presented. I then took the opportunity of telling them that it did not meet those criteria and in the present state of affairs I could not possibly even consider recommending it for SMEs because it was neither simple nor effective. That remains my position but, in line with what others have said and Mr Purvis in particular, it would probably be a good thing if there was a simple effective IFRS for SMEs – but only on that particular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea is a good one. I do not want to knock the idea at all, but I am not going to endorse now or in the future anything for SMEs that is just more complex and which no one understands. It is not needed. I take this opportunity of repeating again in Parliament what I have said on many occasions about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms van den Burg mentioned the question of XBRL. We are working with the securities regulator to get consensus on the technical standards for business data and as a result of this dialogue the Commission may take further measures aiming at interoperability of regulatory information systems. XBRL could allow investors to take full advantage of IFRS. Any steps towards requiring the use of XBRL in the European Union should be subject to a thorough impact analysis, including the economic assessment of costs and benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also discussed the matter with the SEC Chairman, Mr Chris Cox, during my recent visit to the United States and I support keeping this agenda point in our regulatory dialogue with the US authorities for the future. These standards will need to be internationally accepted, technologically independent and interoperable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a very exciting development and I know Ms van den Burg has recently had exposure to all this. I took the same opportunity myself some months ago – getting experts to show me how it actually works. I think it is something that is quite revolutionary and something to be welcomed, but we will not do anything about it just yet until we have done other work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mitchell made an interesting point. I think the importance of what he said was that we do not want the IASB to come and say ‘an EU body or any other body’. We want to be an internationally accepted body – because this goal is well worth pursuing – and it needs to be an independent body. I think that should be taken as read, but with proper input from the various stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind everybody in the European Union that it was the EU which gave the IASB such importance. We were the largest jurisdiction to say as from 2005 that the IFRS would become the rule for listed companies. It was some years ago that this decision was made, together with the European Parliament, and that in itself gave greater importance to the IASB and to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say – and I have said this repeatedly to the IASB also – that road testing – you can call it impact analysis – should be done before standards are adopted, particularly by the IASB, and with input from the EU and other bodies as well. We should not be waiting until the standards are endorsed by the IASB. We had the job here of either agreeing to them or rejecting them. We do not have the role of changing them. I think that they should be road tested enough beforehand to see if there are going to be problems, rather than finding out about serious problems after the whole IASB process has been gone through. We made this point repeatedly to the IASB. Hopefully, I think the new governance structures have been appreciated by most of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that more work needs to be done in this particular area but that will lead to fewer problems in the future. Hopefully we will arrive some day at a situation where these things will be more or less automatic and not cause any great headaches for anybody because all the work will have been done previously. We will not have difficulties then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to pick up on two things. There is one point on which I am sure we all agree, and it has been made repeatedly today by speakers who fully support this general development, namely that the IFRS organisation has now taken some action, for example on governance issues, as a result of the pressure applied by this House – by the European Parliament – and by the European Union. There are times when we need to be quite blunt – and I am aware that some of my female colleagues have criticised me in that regard – because certain individuals who have appeared before this House in recent years have occasionally given the unmistakable impression that the European Parliament is of little interest to them. How little progress there has been is clear from the proposal on governance, where it is suggested that the future supervisory bodies may take advice only from persons they have appointed. All I can say is that anyone required in future to report to a parliament on how he or she voted on a particular point should make sure that a share of responsibility and a say in policy-making is part of the package. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">How little commitment there is on the matter of impact assessments is clear from current discussions, in which the IFRS organisation is still refusing to conduct them.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question of standards for SMEs, I have something to say to all those who believe we should introduce them on a voluntary basis. Inspired here by John Purvis – John, this is for you – I intend to quote an independent commentator. Peter Holgate, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, writing in the German edition of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, said the following: </p>
<p class="contents">‘I don’t take the European position all that seriously. Even if they end up not endorsing it, various countries could adopt it in their national generally accepted accounting principles. If a few major players do that you have it brought in by a different door even if the EC doesn’t want to play ball.’ </p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, this means you have to assume that, once a few states have adopted these standards, you will have them imposed on a compulsory basis throughout the European Union. Such is the strategy of this organisation. PricewaterhouseCoopers has already indicated that they see this as a business model. That is why we need our own European set of standards for SMEs: we can build on the IFRS if that is appropriate but if it is not, then we will develop our own standards. It is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that we do not have standards foisted on us through the back door, which nobody wants but which would then become generally binding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty was adopted in November 1997 during the Luxembourg summit. This created the basis for the formation of a European employment strategy. Due to the problem of unemployment in the Member States, where 17 million people were out of work at that time, this issue was made a priority. Nine years later, in 2006, in the enlarged European Union, 64.3% of people of working age were in employment. Denmark had the highest level of employment, Poland the lowest. A total of 7.9% of people of working age were unemployed. As a comparison, unemployment in the United States was 4.6%. Over the last year, 24 of the Member States recorded a drop in unemployment and three reported an increase. The largest decreases were seen in Poland, Bulgaria and Latvia and the largest increase in unemployment was in Estonia.</p>

It was recognized that an open market based on principles of friendship and honesty is the key to stable economic growth and reducing world poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for many people, the WTO is still something of a puzzle. This is due to the lack of transparency in its activities and inappropriate information being made public. The present reduced G4 and G6 working groups are often seen as meetings of the representatives of large countries that are imposing, or that want to impose, their will on other members.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the lack of technical and legal assistance from the WTO for less developed countries that do not gain any economic benefits from increased market liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries such as India, China or Brazil are treated as developing countries, as a result of which they can benefit from more advantageous conditions and various obligations. I believe this to be a mistake in WTO policy. The WTO does not take into account the massive potential of these countries and their resources. The countries take advantage of this fact and often use price dumping in trade relations, which is harmful to other countries. There should be a clearer division of developing countries that takes into account factors such as economic strength, economic development, GDP growth and growth in exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The exact form of this review has yet to be defined, but we are concerned about some of the objectives already indicated for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council has already announced its intention to establish a realistic and rigorous level of payments and that the level of its commitment and payment appropriations must be carefully analysed in relation to the Community’s capacity to absorb them, which suggests that further cuts in the structural policy and cohesion headings, which we oppose, are more likely. We take a different view and believe that a detailed analysis should be made of the failure to spend the full amount allocated under these budget headings, and that measures should be taken to ensure their strict implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the proposal insists on increasing allocations for external action, to provide resources compatible with the EU’s ambitions. The rejection of our proposed amendment has shed light on what this really means. We are vehemently opposed to the Council’s request for additional EU budget allocations for military spending as part of the European Security and Defence Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the budgetary consequences of the expected entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty as well as the European elections and the formation of the new European Parliament and European Commission will be a challenge for continuity in the EU’s legislative and budget activities. At the same time, this is the year in which the 2007-2013 financial perspective is to be fully implemented, following two years of ‘getting up to speed’, which were affected by delays in legislation and, as a consequence, a delay in the start of the long-term programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis placed on financing innovative policies as well as on the European Union’s ambitions in foreign policy is completely understandable. This cannot, however, happen at the expense of the cohesion policy, which is enormously important at the moment because of differences in development between various countries and regions. Section 3 of the report, which deals with the principle of solidarity, describes how the Structural Funds can be used properly and transparently. This takes on particular significance in the light of the budget review planned for 2008-2009, which has consequences for EU finances after 2013. This is yet another important issue for budgetary policy in 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, for many people, the WTO is still something of a puzzle. This is due to the lack of transparency in its activities and inappropriate information being made public. The present reduced G4 and G6 working groups are often seen as meetings of the representatives of large countries that are imposing, or that want to impose, their own ideas on other members.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the lack of technical and legal assistance from the WTO for less developed countries that do not gain any economic benefits from increased market liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries such as India, China or Brazil are treated as developing countries, as a result of which they can benefit from more advantageous conditions and various bonds. I believe this to be a mistake in WTO policy. The WTO does not take into account the massive potential of these countries and their resources. The countries take advantage of this fact and often use price dumping in trade relations, which is harmful to other countries. There should be a clearer division of developing countries that takes into account factors such as economic strength, economic development, GDP growth and growth in exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to him former Southern Rhodesia gave way to a new state of Zimbabwe which gave a democratic voice to the black majority population, after the end of British colonial rule and in the teeth of a white-led policy of apartheid which rebelled against that colonial authority.</p>
<p class="contents">For years Mugabe was an incredibly moderate ruler. He did not pursue the pressing imperative of redistributing land ownership. He was radical only in his objection to homosexuals. Only when he was in danger of losing power did he remember his earlier promises about land reform. Since then his ill-considered actions have reduced his country's economy to total ruin. The redistribution of agricultural land did not follow a proper plan, but was done entirely arbitrarily, with his most aggressive supporters grabbing the land for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Worse still is the way he has treated his political opponents. They have been relentlessly intimidated and attacked but have so far managed to survive. Last time elections were held there was already the suspicion that the results were rigged. This time the opposition won the parliamentary elections, but it seems that the proposed recount is designed to rob them of their victory. The result of the presidential election has been kept secret for a full month already, so the size of Mugabe's defeat remains unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days he has declared enthusiastically that he will never change anything in his country. He can only make good that promise by violence and oppression. He will do it using a shipload of imported Chinese arms. Given these circumstances it is reasonable for the outside world to concern itself with this domestic conflict. Support for refugees, support for the opposition and pressure on the ruling party are essential ways of achieving what Mugabe himself always claimed to want, namely political power for the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is almost a month since elections were held in Zimbabwe. There can be little doubt that those elections were won by the Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe and his henchmen should now be out of office, but we have heard virtually nothing about the election results except that Mugabe’s people are once more reacting with violence and are desperately trying to fix the election outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">For years now, we have pointed to Zimbabwe as the great shame on the face of Africa, a testimony to the effects of tyranny, corruption and exploitation by one man’s appalling regime. Mugabe has destroyed a once prosperous country. Yet, during this time, over all those years, other African leaders have stood by and either done nothing or else they have applauded the tyrant whenever they had the opportunity. What a disgrace! And what a scandal this has been. And what a tragedy – not just for the people of Zimbabwe, but for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">For all those years, the first key to Zimbabwe’s fate has been held by South Africa, yet Thabo Mbeki has not only failed properly to discharge his responsibilities as a mediator but he has blatantly sided with Mugabe. The world watched dumbstruck when Mbeki announced a few days ago that there was no crisis in Zimbabwe, just normal electoral politics.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU has at least imposed targeted sanctions on the Mugabe regime, it went out of its way to ensure that no one took them seriously, even inviting Mugabe, banned from travel to EU countries, to its EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon last December for reasons that were wholly false. What diplomatic or economic effort has really been made to persuade other African countries to do the decent thing over Zimbabwe? The answer is very little.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, there is still time to do the right thing. Jacob Zuma, the ANC leader, has now called for action on Zimbabwe. In our motion for a resolution today we are calling on men of goodwill in the governing Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe to see the light and recognise that a transformation is on the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for us to make our voice heard. Let us bring about that democratic change that at last is required for the sake of the people of Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The very fact that the results of the elections have not yet been announced illustrates the breakdown of the rule of law and it also shows the totalitarian nature of authority in that African state.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in Africa, democracy itself is under serious threat. The regime has again used force against the opposition and against the democratic aspirations of Zimbabwe’s inhabitants. For this reason a decisive reaction is needed from the European Union and this should include our Parliament. We should react to the situation, but we should also condemn the action of China, which, by sending a cargo ship full of arms to the African coast, is trying to support the Mugabe regime.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I am pleased to support the clause in our joint motion for a resolution calling on China to stop sending arms to Zimbabwe.

<p class="contents">Nobody can deny the contribution of these people to achieving freedom for Zimbabwe but, as is so often the case, excessive and long-lasting power, along with opportunism and an uncontrolled appetite for personal materialistic gain, soon corrupted the altruistic spirit of freedom and democracy and turned the ruling regime of Mugabe into an oppressive governing body with no forward vision and with excessive totalitarian manifestations. The result has been the international isolation of Zimbabwe and the continuing slide of the state into poverty and corruption misery.</p>
<p class="contents">In the recent elections the people of Zimbabwe demonstrated their desire for a much-needed change, but the Mugabe regime does not want to relinquish power and it is now seriously risking throwing the country into anarchy and civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this motion for a resolution we are sending the message that the wish of the people of Zimbabwe, expressed through the electoral process, must be respected. We are also making sure that those in Africa who say that they really care about the situation in Zimbabwe fully assume their responsibilities, view the reality of the situation, assess Mugabe, not as he was many years ago but as he is today, and act decisively to bring about democratic transition in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also hope that this resolution will at least help to support those who are trying from inside and outside the country to restore democratic process to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one particular point to which I would like to draw attention and it concerns the famous case of the Chinese vessel <span class="italic">An Yue Jiang,</span> carrying 77 tonnes of arms and munitions destined for Zimbabwe, which was forced to leave the South African port of Durban after dockworkers refused to unload the cargo and a court ruled that the arms could not be transported through South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">According to my information, the vessel is now seeking another port at which to offload its cargo, although it seems, in view of the opposition in the area to accepting the shipment, that the vessel might return to China without accomplishing its mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, it is clear that the vessel should never have been allowed to sail and that all governments need to get together to devise an international treaty on arms transfers as soon as possible because, unfortunately, there are many places in the world like Zimbabwe, which should never be allowed to receive arms or munitions of any description.</p>

Surely this was ample time to count the vote and announce the result. Currently a recount continues in 23 constituencies at the request of the ruling Zanu-PF Party. There are serious concerns regarding how ballot boxes have been stored and it cannot be ruled out that ballot papers are being tampered with in the process of this recount.

The fact that on 14 April 2008 the High Court in Zimbabwe rejected an urgent application from the opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change, for the electoral commission to release the results of the elections shows the dependence of the judiciary on the current incumbent of the presidential office, Robert Mugabe, who is afraid of losing power.</p>

How many times have we stood here impotently railing against the way in which Mugabe oppresses his people? We have not always been unanimous about everything, but on Zimbabwe we do have some kind of consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The disgraceful spectacle of the recent elections is proof yet again that this unscrupulous dictator does not give a damn about democracy. The policy of ethnic cleansing against white farmers continues unabated. Mugabe holds the opposition, the international community, and his own people in contempt. The weakest in Zimbabwe are the first to suffer, but we have known that for years.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet the European Community rolled out the red carpet for this man last December at the EU-African summit in Lisbon. Only Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown stuck to his guns and boycotted this unsavoury little get-together. We all know it, but the nub of the lamentable situation is this. Mugabe knows that he has support. He knows he is backed by a number of fellow-heads of state, or shall we say fellow-dictators in Africa, who dismiss any criticism of his criminal policy as 'neo-colonialism'. South Africa's role is especially perfidious here. Until such time as the African Union unequivocally condemns him, Mugabe will carry on with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe knows he also has the backing of China, which wants to take over Europe's role in Africa and does it by telling corrupt heads of state that China will not give them any grief about human rights and good governance. The Chinese regime is showing its true colours not only in Tibet, but also in Darfur and Zimbabwe. That is the essence of today's debate and it is the shared culpability of China and Africa which we must condemn and highlight more forcefully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In later years, the slogan was turned around to make a double-edged joke: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Rhodesia’. Today the poster might well read: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Zimbabwe’ – referring not to the famous stonework, but to ruined hopes of prosperity and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Union has a duty to use the current situation – in which, despite manipulation of various kinds, the Zimbabwean Opposition’s courage has, after all, won it a major victory – to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important African state. The people there have suffered enough. We must, however, find ways of supporting them that are not liable to be interpreted as neo-colonialism. So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress – although it needs to do more! That is why I particularly welcome the brave example set by the dockworkers.

<p class="contents">First of all I would like to recall the Commission’s continued commitment to the people of Zimbabwe. In this sense, I also would like to emphasise that the European Union remains the most important donor to Zimbabwe and we are willing to continue playing this role.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Zimbabwe, notably following the 29 March elections, is a major preoccupation and, like the European Parliament, the Commission follows events very closely. We are working closely with Member States, both in Zimbabwe and here in Europe, to coordinate action at the level of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Zimbabweans and the neighbouring States are the main players in finding a solution to the crisis and consequently we encourage the regional peers of Zimbabwe to play a crucial role. Therefore the Commission supports ongoing regional efforts and the conclusions of the SADC summit, held on 13 April in Lusaka, calling for the release of the presidential election results and, in the event of a run-off, the appeal made to the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure a secure environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the redeployment by the SADC of an electoral observation mission to cover the ongoing electoral process immediately and until its completion, while regretting that the EU has not been invited to deploy its own election observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of his participation in the SADC summit on poverty, held in Mauritius on 19 April, Commissioner Michel took the opportunity to meet most Presidents or Prime Ministers from SADC Member States to discuss the crisis in Zimbabwe. He thanked them for their efforts and encouraged them to strengthen their engagement to find acceptable solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm the Commission’s willingness to continue to make use of any opportunity for dialogue in order to find a solution to the Zimbabwe crisis. In the meantime, the Commission and Member States continue to provide unprecedented levels of humanitarian aid to Zimbabweans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, the Iranian authorities have successively eliminated all the most important women's rights. Stoning, mutilation and violation of privacy and of the most basic rights are now the rule. Society is reacting increasingly clearly and forcefully to this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the movement for a million signatures that began organising around two years ago in Iran is one of the most important manifestations of Iranian civil society’s wish to demonstrate its opposition to the regime in power.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last two years, we have witnessed around 100 prison sentences and other punishments meted out to people who have signed the movement's petition. Today, after we submitted our motion, we were informed by various human rights organisations that three women activists from this movement – Nashrin Afzali, Nahid Jafari and Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh – have been sentenced to suspended prison sentences and whipping. This is an intolerable situation and I appeal to all my fellow Members to show their repudiation of the situation and express their support for Iranian women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom, democracy and human rights have no meaning there. They do hold elections, but candidates have to be endorsed by the conservative clergy, so dissenters are by definition excluded. Many Iranians have fled the regime of terror in their country and many of them would no longer be alive if they had not done so. We should find room for these refugees in Europe instead of sending them back or treating them as terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time there is no denying that a section of the Iranian population approves of the killing of homosexuals, discrimination against women and the suppression of ethnic minorities. That section abhorred the western decadence in their country during the time of the Pahlavi dynasty, who were driven into exile in the late 1970s after making Iran an extension of America and Europe. There was no talk of democracy then either, and opponents of the regime were persecuted or exiled. The mistakes of the West were largely responsible for the present-day regime of terror coming to power. If Iran had had a real chance of becoming a modern nation under Prime Minister Mossadeq in the early 1950s, it would never have become a breeding ground for the rulers of today.</p>
<p class="contents">There are movements for change in Iran, but they are subjected to generalised harassment. Mrs Khadijeh Moghaddam was seized on 8 April and charged with 'the spreading of propaganda against the state, disruption of public opinion and actions against national security.' She has since been released, but the tight restrictions on women simply continue. We must show solidarity with the oppressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some examples include the exclusion of women from most senior state offices and appointment as judges, the discriminatory rights of women in marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance, the fact that evidence given in court by women carries only half the weight of that given by a man, the legal age of marriage of women at just 13 years and the condemnation of women to severe and degrading punishment, and even death, by primitive and barbaric means, even for such presumed crimes as having an extramarital relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of the governing regime of Iran making efforts to improve the situation, attempts are presently under way to make matters worse. An example is the draft bill on family protection, which is currently under consideration and which aims at further legitimising polygamy, temporary marriage and the unilateral right of men to arbitrary divorce and child custody. In addition, the Iranian authorities are conducting an ever-increasing campaign of repression of female activists and women’s rights defenders in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon the Iranian regime to try to free itself from religious fanaticism and long superseded, failed political philosophies and, using common sense, to try to bring its country back into the 21st century, rather than plunging it further into the dark ages of the extreme Muslim totalitarianism of the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The good news is that thanks, at least in part, to that campaign, Ebrahimi was freed on 17 March 2008 after spending eleven years in prison. The bad news is that her partner was less fortunate and was stoned to death one year ago, just as least ten other women and two men are threatened with death by stoning in Iran at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, this is not just an isolated incident in a country where breaches of human rights, including women’s rights, is achieving disturbing records.

<p class="contents">Ms Moghaddam is a leader of the One Million Signatures petition campaign, which lobbies to change Iranian laws which contradict the principles of gender equality and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the news of Ms Modghaddam’s release, albeit on a high bail. However, we must underline the fact that two other members of the signature campaign, Ms Hana Abdi and Ms Ronak Safazadeh, have been detained since autumn 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we deplore the recent sentencing of four more members of the campaign for allegedly acting against national security, following their participation in a rally outside a Tehran courtroom two years ago: Ms Zeynab Peyghambarzadeh to two years’ suspended imprisonment and Ms Nashrin Afzali, Ms Nahid Jafari and Ms Minoo Mortazi to six months’ suspended imprisonment and 10 lashes. We vigorously condemn such sentences, which can only be seen as part of the ongoing effort to intimidate and humiliate these peaceful women campaigners.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign for women’s rights and equality is very important and significant in the Iranian context. Each of these courageous women deserves our full support. I call on the Iranian authorities to release unconditionally Ms Abdi and Ms Safazadeh and drop all charges against them and their fellow women’s rights campaigners.</p>
<p class="contents">Alas, many other human rights defenders are at risk in Iran. I specifically call on the authorities to release unconditionally Mr Mansour Ossanlou and Mr Emadedin Baghi and to end the harassment, intimidation and political persecution of human rights defenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reiterates its concern about the closure, two months ago, of the independent women’s magazine <span class="italic">Zanan</span>. The Commission appeals to the Iranian authorities to re-allow the publication of <span class="italic">Zanan</span>. The EU will consider Iran’s attitude towards <span class="italic">Zanan</span>, as well as towards the women’s campaign for equal rights, as an indicator of its willingness to seriously engage in the improvement of the human rights situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully comply with its obligations under international conventions, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We also recall that, when standing for election at the UN Human Rights Council, Iran affirmed that it was considering accession to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has raised issues relating to human rights, including women’s rights and the promotion of gender equality, with the Iranian authorities and will continue to do so. Without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with Iran cannot develop properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was not the outcome of a protracted conflict and the resulting emergence of a collective national consciousness, but rather a way of preventing the development of liberation movements. It was a top-down rather than a bottom-up process. From French overseas departments they first became autonomous territories and then independent states.</p>
<p class="contents">With the exception of Guinea (Conakry), French influence has nevertheless always remained greater in these states than in other former colonies. The big desert state of Chad still has a French military presence and that has certainly influenced who was allowed to rule the country and who was not. This powerful European influence has not led to the development of European standards of democracy and human rights in these countries. The states and their national borders derive not from domestic movements which shaped an independent state, but simply from the colonial past.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that ethnic differences can lead to ethnic confrontations. In countries like these that means a continuing struggle for power, over who are the first-class citizens and who the second-class citizens. Ethnic and geographical diversity is often not reflected, or only poorly reflected, in the composition of the government. The problems this causes cannot, in my Group's view, simply be resolved by stationing a new body of European troops there. There has always been a military presence there, and it has made the present situation worse rather than better. The answer lies not in stabilising the current situation, which only benefits the current rulers, but in making space for change from the bottom up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must however remind you about an unfortunate occurrence during the last ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Ljubljana, which took place one month ago. The ACP side rejected the Assembly’s compromise resolution on Chad. What is more, those promoting the rejection of this resolution were delegates from countries that are Chad’s neighbours, even though their concerns had been taken into account in the compromise text. It was difficult for us to understand why our partners from Africa decided to reject this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Parliament resolution, which we will adopt in a few minutes’ time, will fill the gap created by the absence of the much-anticipated ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly resolution. I think we can all agree with the statement by Chad’s President Idriss Deby that looking after 300 000 Sudanese refugees and 170 000 internal refugees in Chad is a heavy burden. European society is aware of this, and this is why 14 European Union countries have decided to carry out the UN Security Council mandate and are beginning to send 4 000 soldiers to Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the European Union has taken responsibility and showed solidarity in this way, even though the scope of this solidarity could be wider. Most of the 14 countries that have decided to take part in the mission, including, to name but a few, Ireland, Finland, Romania and Poland, have no historic or economic links with Chad. These countries, in directing assistance to Chad, have displayed not just solidarity, but also selflessness in their desire to help defenceless civilians, victims of the conflict in Darfur and of the internal strife in Chad, refugees in camps on the Saudi-Chad border and staff in humanitarian missions working in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this mission will be effective in resolving the conflict and will help the people of Chad and Sudan, and we wish the people of Chad successful, free, democratic and transparent elections in 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Torture, imprisonment and various types of repression are systematically used against the opposition. There are restrictions on free speech, and the right to a free trial is also limited. The security forces as well as armed groups from Sudan threaten civilians and attack humanitarian organisations, especially in the eastern part of Chad.</p>
<p class="contents">In Chad there are over 250 000 refugees from Sudan and about 57 000 refugees from the Central African Republic, as well as refugees from Darfur. The conflict in Darfur has spilled over into Chadian territory. The armed conflict is accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe: there is not enough food for refugees, there are sudden increases in the price of food, barely 20% of children attend school, children are forced into the armed forces, and violence against children is becoming increasingly widespread, especially sexually-motivated attacks on girls.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to enable refugees to return to their own homes. It is vital to stop not just the armed conflict in Chad but also the fall-out from the crisis in Darfur. Only a resolution to the armed conflicts can possibly give a chance to help the 4.5 million people in Darfur and Eastern Chad. Only an end to war can make it possible to reduce violations of human rights.</p>

Civil conflict, guerrilla warfare, military coups, religious and ethnic divisions, combined with a hostile, semi-desert environment and a problematic regional neighbourhood, have led to almost continuous unrest in the country. Consequently – and despite the fact that Chad is rich in gold, uranium and oil – Chad is a state suffering from severe poverty and resultant poor health and social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The present governing regime, led by President Deby, having come to power after a coup in 1990 and with a number of dubious electoral wins since then, has been reportedly involved in numerous acts of severe oppression and persecution against opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists. Arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and extrajudicial killings have been documented.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that this motion for a resolution will send a clear message to Mr Deby, as well to all other parties involved in that troublesome part of the world, that the time has come for national reconciliation, the strengthening of democratic processes and respect for human rights.

<p class="contents">Since then, there has been no official word and his family and political colleagues fear that after his arrest he was cold-bloodedly executed. This lack of information cannot be allowed to continue and President Idriss Deby must pass on the information that he has.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the French Government in particular, which has, as we know, provided aid to the President of Chad, to obtain all possible information on the disappearance of Mohamed Saleh, about whom we are extremely concerned, and also on the fate of all the other political prisoners. That cannot, in any event, disguise the tragic situation of over a million people caught in the crossfire.</p>

The mission cannot succeed without the active participation of all the European Union countries.</p>

Firstly, the humanitarian crisis is widespread and for a long time now the aid organisations there have been sending back reports about the growing numbers of internal refugees. The poor levels of security in the refugee camps, the widespread sexual violence, and the difficulty of delivering food aid have made the situation even more critical. Secondly, there are massive restrictions on freedom of speech and many journalists have had to leave Chad for fear of arrest. Supporters of the political opposition have been threatened and have disappeared. This fact often remains in the shadow of the humanitarian crisis, although if things were to improve in this area it would be one important step along the road to a more stable regime.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine solution will of course require strong political will and concrete action on a large scale. Just as important, however, is the need to invest time and effort in the children of Chad and their future by trying hard to prevent them from being recruited into armed gangs of insurgents and investing in their basic education, which could include human rights studies, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wanted to raise a point of the utmost importance to today’s agenda and it is precisely the situation of children in crisis hotspots. A large number, if not the majority of the hundreds of thousands of people who been left homeless are children. And what is their everyday life like? We have all seen the dispiriting images on our television screens.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has an obligation to show solidarity with the whole nation, of course, but we must strive to focus our attention on the children because they cannot look after themselves. It is depressing that only one in five children in Chad attends school and that thousands upon thousands of them carry weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the call for a plan to make human rights an integral part of the school curriculum. It is important for the government of Chad to do all it can to prevent the recruitment of children by rebel groups; the importance of the role of EUFOR will prove crucial here in, for example, communicating with community leaders and focusing their attention on the situation of children in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation there is as dramatic as in Darfur, Sudan or the Central African Republic, where, in addition to the conflicts fuelled by ethnic, language or religious differences, there are also other conflicts of interest, especially to do with politics and oil.</p>
<p class="contents">African countries that are economically poor and poorly developed, even though they may be rich in natural resources, including crude oil, precious gemstones and metals, become not just an arena for trading in these resources or in drugs, but an eager market for the sale of arms, one of the principal causes of human rights abuses. In an atmosphere of growing conflict and war, many unscrupulous local and foreign traders exploit this situation, enriching themselves at the cost of chaos, refugees and the suffering of millions of innocent people, and even genocide, rape and the exploitation of women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is made worse by the passivity of the international community, which is controlled and exploited by great powers that play out their interests on the global stage. Humanitarian missions of various types can do little to help, and sometimes even go against their initial objectives and calling. Such a situation appears hopeless, as long as life and human dignity lose out to practical materialism, liberalism and the growing civilisation of death, which is sometimes propagated even by so-called humanitarian organisations providing education in the name of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, various resolutions and reports may help to ease the consciences of their authors, but will not improve the situation in Africa, until African leaders and the great powers, from both the east and the west, stop benefiting from war and the growing hatred in the African continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Government forces regularly clash with rebels from armed groups from Darfur, who attack transports of humanitarian aid. The state of emergency has been used to imprison the opposition with impunity and to impose savage restrictions on press freedom and freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Of particular concern is the worsening humanitarian situation in the country where, as a result of the conflict in Darfur and its cross-border consequences, there are over 300 000 refugees in 12 camps along the eastern frontier between Chad and Sudan. As a result of continuing battles, supplies of food to the camps are interrupted, and refugees are left to vegetate in terrible conditions. Following mass displacement, the civilian population is prey to aggression and breaches of fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the obvious impasse in stabilising the situation in Chad, international institutions should strengthen their efforts to promote dialogue between all sides in the conflict. Only a global agreement has any chance of averting a humanitarian disaster in the country. It is vital to begin the European forces mission as quickly as possible in order to step up humanitarian activities in the region and to provide increased protection for the civilian population and for refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was clearly a pretext and that pretext was instrumental, but it served to hide the reality of events, the reasons for which the African side rejected the resolution.

<p class="contents">Concerning the internal political process, we welcome the nomination of a new Prime Minister, Mr Abbas. In our view, his declaration of 18 April was a first promising signal which could lead to the normalisation of the relations between the government and the non-armed opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, hopeful that the constitution of the new, inclusive government of 23 April, where four key ministerial posts have been given to non-armed opposition parties coming from <span class="italic">la Coordination des partis politiques pour la défense de la Constitution </span>(CPDC), will pave the way for the relaunching of a more comprehensive dialogue on the basis of the political agreement of 13 August 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel was amongst the first to express concern about the disappearance of members of the opposition following the attempted coup of early February and to call for the immediate release of any opposition leaders held in custody by the Chadian authorities. Like many of the speakers today, we are still vocal concerning the need to shed light on the situation of Mr Ibni Saleh, spokesperson of the CPDC.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard the European Commission, through its role as an international observer to the National Commission of Inquiry, is seeking to develop clarity about these disappearances, which will help engender trust in the political process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the political process, through our 10th European Development Fund and Instrument for Stability we are developing Chad’s capacity to hold legislative elections in late 2009, as envisaged by the 13 August 2007 agreement. This includes support for electoral preparations and the conducting of a national census. Chad has also been included as a country to be followed up in view of a possible EU election observation mission in 2009, if all conditions for such a deployment are met.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the relations between Chad and Sudan, the issue of the rebel groups can only be considered as part of the wider situation, and we are encouraged by the recent Libreville meeting of the Contact Group established under the Dakar Accord between Chad and Sudan. We believe that such sustained diplomatic efforts are essential to calm down the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our humanitarian assistance in East Chad is ongoing (an average of EUR 30 million each year), and needs are adequately covered. Nevertheless, to complement humanitarian aid and the increase in security of refugee and internally displaced people camps that the EUFOR/MINURCAT deployment will bring, our <span class="italic">Programme d’Accompagnement à la Stabililisation de l’Est du Tchad </span>will support the conditions in areas to which internally displaced persons and refugees may choose to return in eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic, with particular regard to access to drinking water and food security. Activities will start under this programme before the rainy season commences.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the success of the MINURCAT mission as crucial to safeguarding the long-term stability and development of Chad, as seen in our EUR 10 million contribution to the MINURCAT operation, we are encouraged that training has started for the first 77 commanders of the <span class="italic">Détachement intégré de sécurité.</span></p>
<p class="contents">To help embed progress, our 10th European Development Fund will include EUR 25 million in support of reform of the justice sector, including the development of the police force, as well as an additional EUR 25 million for Security Sector Reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The priority actions for reducing supply are laid down in the EU Drugs Strategy for the period 2005-2012 and the subsequent EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008. These actions include:</p>
<p>–	strengthening law enforcement cooperation at EU level and between the Member States,</p>
<p>–	prevention and punishment of the import and export of narcotic drugs, including towards the territories of the other Member States,</p>
<p>–	enhancing law enforcement, criminal investigation and cooperation in the field of forensic science, and</p>
<p>–	intensifying law enforcement efforts directed at non-EU countries, especially producer countries and regions along trafficking routes.</p>
<p>Also of great importance are the EU Presidency’s efforts to reach agreement on a Council resolution on Europol which will increase the powers and adaptability of that organisation and provide Community funding.</p>
<p>The Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre on Narcotics (commonly referred to as MAOC-N), which was set up last autumn in Lisbon (and involves seven Member States), has already made some significant seizures.</p>
<p>To combat effectively the illegal EU market in synthetic drugs, the EU is using a new procedure for information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances. The EU has used this procedure most recently in connection with the new psychoactive substance 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) on which the EU Council adopted a Decision establishing control mechanisms and criminal sanctions against the new psychoactive substance 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP) in the EU Member States in March this year.</p>
<p>In the field of foreign relations cooperation has been established with the producer countries, in particular through the action plan for Afghanistan and the Latin American and Caribbean Coordination and Cooperation Mechanism on Drugs.</p>
<p>During the Slovenian Presidency of the EU Council there has been a high-level meeting between the EU and LAC at which the Hofburg Declaration, which sets out further EU cooperation with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, was adopted.</p>
<p>Particular emphasis is also placed on the Balkan route. In this context mention should be made of the action plan for the Western Balkans. This is an important instrument for assisting the Western Balkan countries with regard to drugs and at the same time provides a certain degree of protection against drug trafficking along the Balkan route.</p>
<p>West Africa has become a new priority area. At the fifty-first session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna the Slovenian Presidency, following the drafting of a text for the Horizontal Working Group on Drugs, proposed, on behalf of the EU, that a resolution on West Africa be adopted. This resolution will make it possible to reduce the flow of cocaine to the EU via the countries of West Africa.</p>
<p>The European Union and the Member States are the largest donors in the world. In their relations with the producer countries they are continuing in particular to focus on alternative development, to exchange intelligence and to strengthen institutions.</p>
<p>As regards prevention and treatment, the strategy for the period 2005–2012 provided for a demand reduction approach based on:</p>
<p>–	preventing people from starting to use drugs,</p>
<p>–	preventing experimental use becoming regular use,</p>
<p>–	early intervention for risky consumption patterns, and</p>
<p>–	providing treatment programmes and rehabilitation and social integration programmes.</p>
<p>The EU Action Plan for 2005–2008 lays down 20 action points. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon is of key importance in this respect.</p>
<p>As part of the action plan, in 2007 the Council discussed the production and cross-border trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis and the exchange of information on drugs, drugs in prisons and drugs on the street. An integrated, evidence-based approach was proposed for all the above.</p>
<p>The Commission departments are currently assessing implementation of the 2005–2008 action plan which will form the basis for drawing up the action plan for the period 2008–2012.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0171"></a>

<p>As regards the questions posed by Mrs McGuinness, the Council can make no comment other than to refer to the relevant provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. For example, Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union (consolidated version of the founding treaties), as amended by the Lisbon Treaty, states, inter alia, as follows. The President of the European Council is to chair it and drive forward its work and to ensure the preparation and continuity of the work of the European Council in cooperation with the President of the Commission, and on the basis of the work of the General Affairs Council. The President of the European Council is to endeavour to facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Council and present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings of the European Council. The President of the European Council is, at his level and in that capacity, to ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0173"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council agrees with the European Parliament that the reliability of energy supplies for Europe is of major importance. The European Council clearly confirmed this fact in its decisions in 2006 and 2007. Thus, it is also one of the Community’s principal internal and external policy objectives to safeguard and strengthen security of energy supplies, together with competition and sustainable development, as was reaffirmed in the European Council decisions of March 2007. Furthermore, the importance of increasing the energy security of the EU and its Member States was also set out by the European Council of March this year. It is important to stress that action on climate change and energy, further liberalisation of the internal energy market and new energy technologies are making an important contribution to this objective.</p>
<p>However, we must continue resolutely to develop the external dimension to energy policy for Europe for the period 2007-2009. The March European Council therefore welcomed the progress made in this field. Progress on implementation and the need for further action on the external dimension to energy policy will be assessed more fully on the basis of the strategic review of energy policy which will be presented by the European Commission in November 2008. This strategic review will be given over in particular to reliability of supplies (including in connection with interconnectors) and external energy policy. The strategic review, which the European Council will confirm in spring 2009, will form the basis for a new energy action plan post-2010.</p>
<p>The main elements of the Community’s internal and external energy policy, which will contribute directly and indirectly to greater reliability of supplies, are:</p>
<p>–	Internally:</p>
<p>More legislative instruments, such as the directives on oil stocks, security of gas supplies and security of electricity supplies.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Community’s energy network: the objective of Community energy policy is to create a stronger and better connected energy network and better network management and infrastructure planning and to speed up the incorporation of new power stations into the electricity network; all this helps to increase the network’s ability to deal with shocks, such as interruptions to supplies, accidents and variable flows from renewable resources.</p>
<p>Greater use of renewable resources (binding target of 20% of EU energy use by 2020 and 10% of biofuels in fuel for transport by 2020).</p>
<p>Greater energy efficiency. Reduced energy use will decrease dependence on third countries as regards energy supplies; therefore the Community’s objective is to increase energy efficiency by means of the instruments at its disposal (legislation, research and development, and a promotional campaign).</p>
<p>In connection with the Trans-Europe Energy Network (TEN), the Council would like to draw the Member’s attention to the last year’s appointment of coordinators for four priority projects of European interest – including the Nabucco gas pipeline through which gas from central Europe is supplied from the Caspian region – to promote the implementation of these projects, which are very important for reliable supplies of energy and the operation of the internal energy market.</p>
<p>–	Externally:</p>
<p>The European Union is actively seeking greater security of energy supplies through diversity of energy resources, suppliers and supply routes; in addition to the abovementioned TEN projects of European interest this is also done by means of:</p>
<p>regular dialogue on energy and cooperation with major producer countries and organisations, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Norway and OPEC, and also with major consumer and transit countries such as the USA, Brazil, China, India and Ukraine;</p>
<p>energy partnerships, for example with Africa, established in December 2007, and with Egypt;</p>
<p>close cooperation with the countries of Central Asia, the Caspian region and the Black Sea as part of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on energy (the Fifth Ministerial Conference was held on 17 December 2007 in Cyprus) etc., and active participation in structures such as the Energy Community and the Energy Charter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0182"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In 2008 there is an urgent need to speed up progress on meeting the Millennium Development Goals, and in that respect the fight against HIV/AIDS remains a Council priority. The Commission and the Member States are fully committed to implementing the ‘European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through external action’, which the Council and the Member States adopted in May 2005.</p>
<p>In its conclusions on ‘Recently emerging issues regarding HIV/AIDS’ of 23 April 2007<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Council encouraged the Commission and Member States to ensure fulfilment of existing commitments within the ‘EU Programme for Action on HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through external action’ and called on the Commission and Member States to report on progress, including on these emerging issues regarding HIV/AIDS, in the context of the joint monitoring and reporting on the European Programme for Action in 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p>In that connection the Council will assess the present state of implementation of the 2005 programme for action<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and any measures adopted in this field by the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p>In its ‘Annual Report on the European Community’s Development Policy and the Implementation of External Assistance’ to the European Parliament and the Council the Commission reports each year in particular on the availability of EC funds for implementing the programme for action. The 2007 Annual Report on EC external assistance in 2006<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> contains information which shows that in connection with poverty reduction the European Union is increasingly involved in the fight against diseases linked to poverty, in particular through implementation of the European programme for action. A vast array of instruments and channels of financing are being developed, primarily through bilateral programmes financed by the EC budget and through the European Development Fund, and amount to approximately EUR 245 million a year excluding general budget support .<a href="#defann_5_4" name="refann_5_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission and the Member States have been active donors to the ‘Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)’ since it was established in 2001–2002. The EU is also playing a crucial and visible role in the development of a new and innovative method of international funding, which emphasises its firm commitment to fighting these three diseases. The EU and the Member States together have become the biggest donors to the GFATM since they provided 53% of the cash contributions in 2003–2006. The EU is an extremely important development partner and therefore its political support is of crucial importance to the successful development and operation of the GFATM, for example in the efforts to provide predictable financial flows in connection with the replenishment process.</p>
<p>The EU is at present implementing a European Programme for Action to tackle the critical shortage of health workers in developing countries (2007–2013), in which Africa is a priority geographic goal. A Commission progress report is expected soon.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS has in fact hit Africa hard. The Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the ACP countries and the EC applies to the majority of African countries. Promoting the fight against HIV/AIDS, protection of sexual and reproductive health, and the rights of women in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) are among the areas of support in connection with the cooperation strategy<a href="#defann_5_5" name="refann_5_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> under the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and activities in this field are normally funded by the EDF.</p>
<p>The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)<a href="#defann_5_6" name="refann_5_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, which the European Parliament and Council adopted on 18 December 2006, includes addressing poverty diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, though geographic programmes. The Development Cooperation Instrument’s programme ‘Investing in People’ includes, in the section ‘Good health for all’, the fight against poverty diseases, targeted at the main communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS among them. A financial reference amount of EUR 1 060 million has been earmarked for the period 2007–2013. Dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its effects on Southern African society is one of the objectives of EU aid for Southern Africa in connection with the Development Cooperation Instrument; a financial reference amount of EUR 980 million is earmarked for that geographical programme for the period 2007–2013.</p>
<p>The fight against HIV/AIDS with particular emphasis on Africa is and remains the most important priority of the EU, both internally and externally. The Council expressed this clearly in the EU statement ‘Keeping the promise to stop HIV/AIDS’ on World AIDS Day on 1 December 2007, as did the European Council in its conclusions of 21/22 June 2007.<a href="#defann_5_7" name="refann_5_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a></p>
<p>Finally, one of the four principle objectives of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership,<a href="#defann_5_8" name="refann_5_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> which was approved at the Lisbon Summit on 9 December 2007, is ‘to ensure that all the Millennium Development Goals are met in all African countries by 2015’ and HIV/AIDS is among the global challenges and issues of common concern which will be tackled together in this long-term strategic partnership. In that respect a broad range of objectives are planned, such as:</p>
<p>improved access to prevention, treatment, care and support services, including for HIV/AIDS,</p>
<p>greater financial and human resources,</p>
<p>improved access to affordable quality medicines and commodities, and</p>
<p>increased capacity of African countries to train and retain qualified health workers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, 2008 will be a year of measures to implement the policies and instruments for the fight against HIV/AIDS and it is hoped that the positive trend in terms of efforts and success that we noted in 2006 and that was reportedly also seen in 2007 will continue in 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council considers that one of the fundamental reasons for the success and swift implementation of the data exchange mechanisms laid down in the Prüm Treaty, which will be set out in the Council Decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation (see the ‘Prüm’ Decision),<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and its implementing decision, is the fact that that the decision does not affect national legislation and national structures. Article 2 of this decision clearly stipulates that it is for the Member States to decide on the treatment of data stored on the national database of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Each Member State also decides which parts of its DNA database it will make available to the other Member States for searching and comparison purposes. This information is published in a manual drawn up and supplemented by the General Secretariat of the Council.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not for the Council to determine the kind of persons whose data has to be or could be exchanged.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom authorities decide which data will be used and/or made available for searching and comparison purposes under the ‘Prüm’ Decision.</p>

<p>On 18 February 2008 the Council adopted the following conclusion: ‘The Council reiterates the EU's adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, inter alia the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and all UN Security Council resolutions. It underlines its conviction that in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under SCR 1244, Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case which does not call into question these principles and resolutions.’</p>
<p>The fact that the case of Kosovo is unique is emphasised by UN Security Council Resolution 1244 which was adopted by the UN Security Council following the humanitarian tragedy during which almost 800 000 of Kosovo’s inhabitants were forced to leave their homes and regional stability was endangered. This resolution introduced interim UN administration in Kosovo and provides for a political process to determine Kosovo’s future status. On the basis of a report by Ambassador Kai Eide, which was presented to the Security Council on 7 October 2005, the UN Secretary-General recommended that a start be made on the process of determining Kosovo’s future status in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and appointed a special envoy to carry out this process. The process is intended to bring about the effective cooperation of the Kosovar Serbs and other nationalities and communities in Kosovo.</p>
<p>Since Kosovo is a unique case, it is not regarded as a precedent for other situations – including situations within the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0213"></a>

<p>Germany, its citizens and honest politicians have plenty of reasons to be incensed by the revelations that top local business people have defrauded state coffers by making use, illegally, of European tax havens. But, arguably, all EU Member States are faced with this misconduct to a greater or lesser extent. One way to look at this problem is to try to close all loopholes, which would involve the status of current tax havens. But there is a broader aspect at stake here, which is the social responsibility of people at the apex of economic, and sometimes political, power; when they misbehave so blatantly they not only bring their reputation down, but they also deal severe blows to the functioning of our institutions.</p>
<p>How does the Council intend to broaden the scope of the fight against tax evasion to the area of moral accountability and the need to prevent the erosion of our citizens' confidence in democratic institutions?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At the start of the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) in October 2005, the Council and the Commission decided that they would sign the SAA once progress in the following three areas had been jointly assessed:</p>
<p>development of a legislative framework and establishment of administrative capacities for the proper implementation of any SAA,</p>
<p>efficient implementation of the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and</p>
<p>full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Commission was to report to the Council on the outcome of the assessment.</p>
<p>The first point does not present any particular difficulties. In the latest progress report, dated November 2007, the Commission emphasised the progress that had been made in reforming the public administration and found these reforms to be in line with European standards on the whole. In the context of negotiations on the SAA, Serbia has shown that it possesses good administrative capabilities. In view of Serbia’s institutional capacity, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, in the conclusions of its December meeting, expressed confidence that the country would be capable of accelerating its preparations on the road towards the European Union.</p>
<p>The second point is no longer applicable, because the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro no longer exists. As regards the third point, the Council has stressed the importance of full Serbian cooperation with the ICTY several times in the conclusions adopted at its meetings. A satisfactory resolution of these issues is also one of the conditions for the signing of the SAA. An important indicator of fulfilment will be the content of the next report from Serge Brammertz, Prosecutor of the ICTY.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0222"></a>

In the opinion, hydrogen and fuel cells were presented in such an enthusiastic manner as to appear almost a panacea for all energy and environmental problems. It must be remembered, however, that hydrogen is merely an energy carrier. In order to produce it, other energy sources need to be used, with, depending on the technology employed, varying degrees of efficiency, ranging from a few percent (normal electrolysis at room temperature) to 80% (high-temperature decomposition of water). If methane or natural gas were to be used, it would be necessary either to produce them or to purchase them from somewhere.</p>

<p>The honourable Member may rest assured that the Council is well aware of the complexity of the technical challenges that need to be addressed in connection with the widespread use of hydrogen and fuel cells in the European transport system. This is reflected in the general introduction to the draft Council Regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, in which the Council states that the challenge posed by fuel cells and hydrogen is of great complexity and scale and that technical skills in these fields are very widely dispersed (document 6935/08, recital 9 on page 4). The task of experts in the field of research and development is therefore to assess the technological and economic potential of fuel cells and hydrogen, identify theoretically promising technological developments and examine the associated technological and economic challenges before a decision is taken on their use on the basis of well-founded and compelling scientific evidence. Scientific documents sometimes tend to present the potential applications of new technology as panaceas. In some cases, such documents merely list all the potential uses of the technology in question which require further study. The findings of a comprehensive study may reveal that few or none of the potentially highly promising applications are likely to prove successful in practice. That, however, is the way in which scientific progress is normally achieved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0238"></a>

<p>Some of the legal instruments establishing European agencies stipulate that the progress and working methods of the agency in question are to be assessed, or else they contain a review clause. Under Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 establishing a European Railway Agency, for instance, the Agency’s working methods and the results of its activities are subject to evaluation by the Commission, which may present a proposal for changes to the provisions of the Regulation. The Regulation establishing a European Food Safety Authority provides for an independent internal review, to be commissioned at six-yearly intervals by the Authority in cooperation with the Commission. The Council is not involved in that revision unless it is followed by a legislative proposal for the revision of the instrument establishing the Authority.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the European Parliament and the Council, as the two arms of the budgetary authority, adopted a joint statement on Community agencies on 18 April 2007, in which they invited the Commission:</p>
<p>to provide annually a budgetary overview covering all existing and future Community agencies, including budgetary information regarding their founding instruments, key budgetary indicators and staff numbers and the ratio between operational and administrative expenditure;</p>
<p>to carry out a thorough cost-benefit analysis and systematically apply and promote the procedure envisaged in paragraph 47 of the Interinstitutional Agreement before establishing any new agency,</p>
<p>to assess the Community agencies on a regular basis, focusing particularly on cost-benefit ratios, and</p>
<p>to implement the review clauses contained in the regulations establishing the respective agencies.</p>

<p>The High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, held a meeting in February 2008 with Nur Hassan Hussein, the new Prime Minister of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).</p>
<p>The EU Troika visited Mogadishu on 25 March 2008, holding talks with the President and the Prime Minister, with the chiefs of the the Hawiye clan, with representatives of civil society and with the Commander-in-Chief of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The objectives of the Troika visit were:</p>
<p>to signal the support of the EU for the new Government and its planned programme of priority measures,</p>
<p>to proclaim the full support of the EU for the effective strategy of conciliation between the TFG and the Opposition at all levels with a view to ensuring that the transitional period is brought to a successful conclusion,</p>
<p>to express the desire of the EU for better coordination within the leadership structures in the institutions of the Transitional Federal Government, and</p>
<p>to maintain the role of the EU as a player acting in support of a lasting political solution for Somalia and coordinating its activities with those of the international community under the aegis of the UN.</p>
<p>On several occasions the Council has stressed the importance of the leading role of the UN in the provision of international support for the political process in Somalia and of the need to avoid initiatives working at cross-purposes. It has also expressed its support for AMISOM, the African Union Mission to Somalia.</p>

<p>It nevertheless wishes to assure the honourable Member that the general position of the EU on adherence to the elementary principles of democracy and human rights and its commitment to these principles are crystal-clear. As a state engaged in negotiations on accession to the EU, Croatia must fulfil the political criteria laid down at the Copenhagen meeting of the European Council; in other words, it must possess sufficient institutional stability to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and protection of minorities.</p>
<p>With regard to the requirements laid down in the framework of the accession negotiations, Croatia is also expected to continue its reform process and make further progress in applying the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law which underpin the European Union.</p>
<p>All of these matters are discussed at the meetings of the Stabilisation and Association Council, the next of which will be held in Luxembourg on 28 April, as well as at the accession negotiations, under the heading of justice and fundamental rights. In addition, the competent Council bodies will continue to pursue these matters and monitor the implementation of the revised Accession Partnership.</p>

<p>In this context, we point out that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 stated that women’s full and equal enjoyment of human rights was a priority objective of the international community and that governments and the United Nations should intensify their efforts to achieve it.</p>

<p>The Council thanks the honourable Member for her interest in this important matter. The fight against cancer is a major priority of the Slovenian Presidency in the realm of public health. Following the recent conference entitled The Burden of Cancer – How Can It Be Reduced?, which was held in Brdo pri Kranju, Slovenia, on 7 and 8 February 2008, the Presidency will present Council conclusions for adoption at the Council meeting of 10 June 2008.</p>
<p>The Presidency will propose that the Council ask the Commission to present an EU action plan for the fight against cancer based on the fundamental principles and strategic objectives set out in the White Paper entitled Together for Health: a Strategic Approach for the EU, 2008-2013;<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the action plan should cover all aspects of a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to cancer control, including cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.</p>
<p>The European Community and the Member States are making untiring efforts to prevent and control cancer on the basis of the available evidence by means of initiatives and measures designed to promote public health and prevent illness by encouraging healthy lifestyles. These efforts focus on reducing tobacco consumption, promoting healthy diets and physical activity, reducing dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol, screening for early diagnosis, lessening the impact of physical, chemical and biological carcinogens in the workplace and in the environment and ensuring the safety of food products with a view to minimising the risk of developing cancer.</p>
<p>Prevention remains the most effective long-term strategy for reducing the increasingly heavy burden of cancer. A consistent approach to the promotion of public health and primary prevention with the aid of appropriate measures in various legislative areas and in various fields of activity would help to prevent cancer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2005 the Council began its examination of the Commission’s draft for an interinstitutional agreement on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies.<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The debate was concluded in April 2007. A letter of 22 June 2007 addressed to the President of the European Parliament summarised the outcome of the Council’s debates for the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The letter referred to the Council having agreed that principles such as good governance, better lawmaking, responsibility, transparency, professionalism and evaluation of the agencies on the basis of cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments were to be taken into account when regulatory agencies were established. Nevertheless, there was insufficient support within the Council for the adoption of a legally binding instrument or interinstitutional agreement establishing a general regulatory framework for regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>In the same letter, the Council also expressed its willingness to examine, together with Parliament and the Commission, problems relating to the establishment and operation of regulatory agencies. This is intended not only as a case-by-case examination on the appropriate legal basis but is also to take place on the basis of other existing legal instruments, such as those governing budgetary procedure, and in accordance with Council decisions.</p>

The argument on which this ban is based is unacceptable and dangerous, namely that the Czech KSM is 'in favour of the socialisation of the means of production', which shows that this unacceptable decision forms part of the more general anti-communist campaign unfolding in the EU, which aims to persecute and criminalise communist ideology and anti-imperialist activity.</p>

<p>The Commission is currently analysing the transposition of Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has transposed this Directive in particular through the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003. While it is still too early to give a definitive assessment of the conformity of those Regulations with Directive 2000/78/EC, the Commission would like to comment on the points raised in the question.</p>
<p>Under Article 4(1) of Directive 2000/78/EC, it is possible to justify a difference in treatment if a particular characteristic is a genuine, determining occupational requirement. This possibility exists only in relation to the nature of the particular occupational activity concerned.</p>
<p>Under the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, the Commission notes that an employer can apply a requirement relating to sexual orientation in respect of employment for an organised religion if the aim is to comply with the doctrines of the religion or, in order to avoid a conflict, with the strongly held religious convictions of a significant number of the religion's followers. The Commission considers that such provisions could be held to be compatible with the Directive, provided that there exists a genuine, determining occupational requirement which fulfils a legitimate objective and which is applied in a proportionate manner.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of heterosexual persons against discrimination, it should be noted that the ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation applies in a similar manner to homosexual and heterosexual persons. A heterosexual person would therefore be protected against potential discrimination in the same way as a homosexual person.</p>
<p>The "causality test" in cases of discrimination is laid down in Article 2 of the Directive, which defines discrimination. Direct discrimination based on sexual orientation occurs where a person is treated less favourably than another person in a comparable situation because of his or her sexual orientation. Indirect discrimination occurs where a neutral rule or practice has a disproportionate impact on persons of a given sexual orientation, unless the objective pursued is legitimate and is applied in a proportionate manner. It should also be noted that Article 10 of the Directive allows the burden of proof to be reversed where the person claiming to be the victim of discrimination can establish a presumption of discrimination: in that case, it is for the respondent to prove that there has been no discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The terms 'proper social protection' and 'lasting high employment' relate to objectives to be attained in the context of the current social policy, since they are mentioned in Article 136 of the present EC Treaty. The Treaty of Lisbon has confirmed those objectives, since Article 136 of the EC Treaty has not been amended. In addition, the Commission notes that Article 2 of the EU Treaty has been amended by the Treaty of Lisbon, which replaces 'The Union shall set itself the following objectives: to promote economic and social progress and a high level of employment' with 'the Union … shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on … a highly competitive social economy, aiming at full employment'.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that the Community institutions have not yet produced a final legal definition of those objectives.</p>

<p>Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Articles 145 to 148, to which the honorable Member refers, will be the articles relating to employment policy, which is to be one of the policies to be developed under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Those articles are, in fact Articles 125 to 128 of the prsent EC Treaty and have not been amended by the Treaty of Lisbon. The European institutions will not therefore be able to adopt binding employment measures as they do at present. Hence European cooperation on employment is derived from the European Employment Strategy, which is based on the open method of coordination, in which the Council and Commission agree on the broad lines and joint objectives and on the possibility of adopting specific recommendations.</p>
<p>The Commission informs the honorable Member that Article 151 of the Treaty of Lisbon reproduces the exact wording of the present Article 136 of the EC Treaty, as well as its objectives. As at present, the achievement of those objectives will entail the Community supporting and supplementing s action by the Member States in a number of areas listed in Article 137 of the EC Treaty, such as social security and social protection, as well as several forms of protection of workers.</p>

<p>The Commission notes that demographers tend to be very cautious when it comes to attributing demographic phenomena, such as a change in the number of births, to any specific social policy measure. The relatively high birth rates in Norway are likely to result from a range of different socio-economic and cultural factors. While the Commission has not carried out evaluations of specific measures, it has concluded, on the basis of a wide range of available evidence, that family support which promotes better reconciliation of work, private and family life is most likely to reduce the gap between the desired and the actual number of children people have.</p>
<p>The Norwegian parental benefit scheme promotes reconciliation of work and family life by offering a high level of benefits (80% to 100% of previous earnings up to a limit of around € 50 000 per annum) for a short period of 44 or 54 weeks (the longer period only at the lower rate of 80% of previous earnings). Six weeks of the paid parental leave are reserved for the father and cannot be taken by the mother. Thus the scheme encourages a rapid return to the labour market and, notably by offering a full replacement of lost earnings up to a high ceiling, creates the conditions for fathers with higher earnings than their partners to take parental leave<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In order to support Member States wishing to modernise their family policies, and especially to improving the work-life balance, the Commission has taken a series of initiatives with a strong focus on reconciliation and close links with the Lisbon strategy and gender-equality policy, including the following:</p>
<p>In May 2007 the Commission published a Communication "Promoting inter-generational solidarity"<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which includes an overview of family support policies in the EU and responds to the European Council's call for a European Alliance for Families, a European platform for the exchange of information, good practice and research results in the area of family policies;</p>
<p>The Commission has launched a consultation of the European social partners in accordance with Article 138(3) of the EC Treaty on the subject of reconciliation of private, family and work life, including the possible revision of Directive 96/34/EC<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on parental leave. The consultation procedure has advanced to the second stage and, depending on the final outcome, the Commission may decide to put forward proposals to supplement existing legislation in the area of reconciliation;</p>
<p>In June 2007, the Commission set up a new government-expert group on demographic issues comprising representatives of all 27 Member States. In 2008, the expert group decided to focus on the evaluation of family policies and policies in the field of active ageing;</p>
<p>Various projects funded under the EU framework research programmes and studies on family-related topics will increase knowledge of demography and family policies. The Commission is also supporting the OECD in order to speed up the development of its new family indicators database;</p>
<p>The Commission will continue the series of biennial demography forums and reports. The next demography forum is scheduled to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 November 2008 and the second demography report is to be published in time for the forum. Both the forum and the report will give attention to reconciliation policies.</p>
<p>The Commission is in contact with a wide range of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on family related issues. In particular, meetings and seminars, to which NGO representatives are invited, have been held in connection with the meetings of the government expert group on demographic issues. One of these seminars, which took place in November 2007, focused on child care and a further seminar on family policies is envisaged for June 2008. Furthermore, the web portal of the European Alliance for Families will provide a forum for contacts and exchange of information between relevant organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the consultation initiated by the Commission in 2005 under Article 138 of the EC Treaty, on 26 April 2007 the social partners concluded an independent agreement on harassment and violence at work. The Commission suggests that the honourable Member refer to the answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-1130_EN.html">E-1130/08</a> by Mr De Rossa, which describes the purpose and content of the agreement.</p>
<p>In particular, the introduction to the agreement recognises all the possible forms of harassment and violence that might occur in the workplace. Violence by 'third parties', such as customers, patients, school pupils, etc., are expressly referred to and covered by the agreement, but are not the subject of specific provisions.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concerns of the honourable Member as to the need to take all forms of violence into account, including third-party violence. That form of violence often requires a different response that might be outside the scope of the company. At the request of several organisations of social partners in certain sectors affected by problems of third-party violence at work, such as private security, hospitals and commerce, the Commission held a multi-sector seminar on third-party violence in Brussels on 14 March 2008. The social partners in those sectors jointly expressed the intention of considering the possibilities of adding to the interprofessional agreement to make it more specific, sectoral and/or multi-sector. The seminar is the first stage in that process, which might lead to the opening of multi-sector negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the independent agreement on harassment and violence at work makes a very positive contribution to the prevention of all forms of violence and harassment at work and that it would be appropriate to await the results from its implementation and any sectoral additions before assessing the need for other Community initiatives in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Crystalline silica is a basic component of soil, sand, granite, and many other minerals. Quartz is the most common form of crystalline silica. It causes silicosis, a slow, progressive, disabling disease. It also causes lung cancer and there is evidence that it causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
<p>The WHO already classifies crystalline silica as a class 1 carcinogen to which 3.2 million workers are exposed for over 75% of their working time. In addition to this, 2.7% of deaths from lung/bronchial cancers are due to crystalline silica (source: European Agency for Occupational Safety and Health).</p>

<p>The main effect in humans of inhaling silica dust is silicosis. Epidemiological studies reveal, in addition, an association between exposure to crystalline silica dust and an increased probability of developing lung cancer. As a result, crystalline silica has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organisation, as a group 1 carcinogen to humans. The EU has not yet classified crystalline silica as a carcinogenic substance.</p>
<p>There is sufficient scientific information to conclude that the relative lung cancer risk is increased in persons with silicosis, but not, apparently, in employees exposed to silica dust in quarries or in the ceramic industry but without silicosis. The first step to reducing the cancer risks is therefore to prevent silicosis. The full implementation and enforcement of the prevention strategy laid down in Directive 98/24/EC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will be effective in preventing the onset of silicosis, it will also reduce the cancer risk, and it will ensure that the 3.2 million workers exposed to crystalline silica are protected.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits has discussed respirable crystalline silica extensively and has issued a Recommendation to the Commission<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It concludes that, although a clear threshold for silicosis development cannot be identified, the occupational exposure limit should lie below 0.05 mg/m<span class="sup">3 </span>of respirable silica dust.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica should be adequately protected. It will evaluate the effects of the practical implementation of Directive 98/24/EC in terms of reducing exposure levels to crystalline silica dust and, in particular, the results achieved as a result of the implementation of the multi-sectorial social dialogue agreement on "Workers health protection through good handling and use of crystalline silica and products containing it"<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

Periods of economic growth that stimulate job creation provide in principle an opportunity for many people on the outer edges of the labour market to find a (better) job. But the right conditions have to be in place to ensure they can actually make use of those opportunities.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Strategy, underpinned by the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (and in particular Guideline 19), provides a framework for the Member States to develop employment policies specifically addressing the needs of people on the fringes of the labour market. In 2006 the Commission conducted a public consultation on the scope for European action on active inclusion and minimum income. The concept of active inclusion is based on three policy pillars: a link to the labour market through job opportunities or vocational training; income support at a level that is sufficient to live in dignity; and better access to basic services.</p>
<p>On the basis of an analysis of replies to the consultation<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission decided to launch the second-stage consultation in which it announced its intention of issuing a recommendation on common principles for implementing the active inclusion approach.</p>
<p>The in-work poverty rate ranges from 3% to 14% across the EU. It is:</p>
<p>- 3% in the Czech Republic;</p>
<p>- 4% in Finland and Belgium;</p>
<p>- 5% in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Slovenia and Malta;</p>
<p>- 6% in France, Ireland and the Netherlands;</p>
<p>- 7% in Cyprus, Estonia and Austria;</p>
<p>- 8% in the United Kingdom;</p>
<p>- 9% in Slovakia, Latvia, Luxemburg and Italy;</p>
<p>- 10% in Hungary, Lithuania and Spain;</p>
<p>- 13% in Greece;</p>
<p>- 14% in Portugal and Poland.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2006, the European Union examined the issue of what is popularly known as EU ‘health tourism’. It was discussed how to ensure that an EU citizen not receiving treatment in his or her own country would be able to do so in another EU country. It was proposed that the cost of treatment in such a case would be covered by funds from the health care sector of the Member State of which the patient was a citizen. Regrettably, in December 2007, publication of the EU’s ‘health tourism’ plan was postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>What steps is the Commission taking to speed up consideration of the EU’s ‘health tourism’ plan and the establishment of a clear procedure for patients undergoing treatment in a foreign country, in the light of the growing numbers of people travelling as a result of the expansion of the Schengen area?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question raised by the honourable Member relates to cross-border health care. As regards payment for health care in another Member State, under Community law patients can already be reimbursed for treatment in another Member State.</p>
<p>Under Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security systems, the insured person uses his health insurance and treatment is paid for at the rates of the State in which the treatment is provided, with, if necessary, a differential supplement if the reimbursement rate for the treatment is more favourable in his own Member State than in the Member State where he receives the treatment. The nationality of the person is immaterial. That system covers the treatment required during a stay, using the European sickness insurance card, and non-urgent treatment for which the competent authorities have authorised the patient to seek treatment in another Member State. The Court has clarified the conditions in which such authorisation cannot be refused. The rules are explained on the Commission website in all the official languages.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that, by application of the principles of free movement to health services, patients may be reimbursed for health care received in another Member State. In the case of non-hospital treatment, patients may obtain a refund without prior authorisation. In such cases, reimbursement is based on the charges of the State to whose health care scheme the patient belongs. For hospital treatment, the Court has agreed that Member States may continue to require prior authorisation in the interests of public health, to enable services to be planned nationally. In that instance, the Court stated that any authorisation granted under Regulation 1408/71/EEC for treatment in another Member State would require application of the coordination mechanisms under Regulation 1408/71/EEC.</p>
<p>The rights brought to light by the Court of Justice judgments in the various cases are clear, but patients need to be more aware of them. As confirmed by the public consultation organised by the Commission in 2006, there is a need to clarify the position with the mechanisms guaranteeing rights to reimbursement of health care provided in another Member State, and the efficiency and safety of cross-border health care.</p>
<p>With a view to attaining those objectives, a proposal for a directive on the exercise of rights of patients with regard to cross-border health care will be submitted to the Commission for adoption in June 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0239"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently drafting a proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. The Commission is expected to adopt the proposal in May 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission regularly consults the Member States and the organisations representing disabled people, including the European Disability Forum, through the High-Level Group on Disability. At its last meeting, for instance, replies to an extensive questionnaire on progress in ratification/conclusion and implementation of the UN Convention were dealt with. Such consultations will continue.</p>
<p>On 27 February 2007 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0077">COM(2007)77</a>). The Council adopted a Decision dated 20 March 2007 authorising the Community to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and issued a declaration on the Optional Protocol (Annex II to the Decision) to the effect that the Council would reconsider as soon as possible the question of the signing by the European Community of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Commission considers that the Council is now in a position to take a final decision on how to proceed with the Optional Protocol.</p>
<p>As required by Article 44(1) of the UN Convention and Article 12 of the Optional Protocol, at the time of formal confirmation the European Community has to declare the extent of its competence regarding matters governed by the Convention. The extensive screening Community legislation has been carried out in the meantime.</p>
<p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities contains provisions that fall within both the Community sphere of competence and that of the Member States. The Community and the Member States should jointly define the precise mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the Convention in areas of shared competence. The nature of those mechanisms will be set out in the Commission proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Convention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0244"></a>

<p>The Commission is convinced that it is necessary to harmonise administrative sanctions in order to effectively fight Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.</p>
<p>The Proposal aims (i) to strengthen the ability of Member States to ensure that, in a single market, operators do not take advantage of different sanction systems at national level to the detriment of the common policy and (ii) to take provisional action to prevent the continuation of the IUU activity identified.</p>
<p>It is up to each Member State to ensure that Community law is properly enforced and Member States may regulate their own sanctions' system in the manner they consider most appropriate as long as the sanctions have a deterrent effect in accordance with the Proposal.</p>
<p>The IUU proposal will harmonise the levels of administrative sanctions to be applied by Member States in case of a serious infringement by operators carrying out IUU fishing activities.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that levels of sanctions must be harmonised in order to ensure that any economic advantage will be more than offset by the sanctions imposed.

<p>As regards animal welfare and trade issues, there are no binding multilateral agreements in force directly addressing this issue and animal welfare is in particular not explicitly addressed in the Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary agreement under the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>This is a major cause for concern for the Commission. As a consequence, the Commission developed in 2002 a specific strategy to address the competitiveness implications for EU producers resulting from animal welfare systems for caged birds. Several initiatives to promote animal welfare as a competitive advantage, as stated in the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010, have already been undertaken.</p>
<p>Bilateral agreements with Chile and Canada already include a chapter on animal welfare. Furthermore, a co-operation agreement with New Zealand was signed in 2007. An increasing number of trading partners are today monitoring the developments with interest and are evaluating possibilities on how to co-operate with the EU on this issue that is of growing importance especially in developed countries.</p>
<p>A Eurobarometer survey of 2006 stated that 89% of the consumers think that imports should be produced under the same animal welfare conditions as those originating from the EU. Therefore the Commission is presently evaluating the options for an animal welfare labelling system and intends to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council in 2009. Such a system should be WTO compatible and would allow EU producers to highlight the high animal welfare standards in the Community to consumers, who in turn are increasingly insisting on such higher standards in their purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>The high-level conference on mental health on 13 June 2008 will highlight that mental well-being in the population supports public health in the EU. It also contributes to successful learning and working, and to social cohesion.</p>
<p>However, mental disorders belong to the most prevalent and serious illnesses in Europe. In extreme cases, they can lead to suicide.</p>
<p>In recent years, suicide levels declined slightly from 11.9 cases per 100 000 of population in 2000 to 10.6 cases in 2006.</p>
<p>But the situation remains unsatisfactory, given that the EU seeks to ensure a high level of human health protection in its Community policies and activities:</p>
<p>-	suicide still causes more deaths in the EU than road traffic accidents;</p>
<p>-	enlargement increased the inequalities between Member States. In several of them, suicide rates belong to the highest in the world.</p>
<p>The June 2006 European Council confirmed the need for action: it made "Improving mental health and tackling suicide risks" an objective of the Renewed EU-sustainable development strategy.</p>
<p>The high level conference will therefore invite Governments to engage in an exchange to identify how they can most effectively reduce levels of suicide, and depression, which is one of the key risk factors. The purpose is the adoption of a Mental Health Pact which could serve as the basis for future actions in the promotion of good mental health, the prevention of mental ill health in young people, the elderly and minorities as well as the fight against social exclusion and discrimination against people in mental ill health.</p>
<p>Partners in the health sector, regions and communities, in schools and at workplaces will be invited to join the efforts.</p>
<p>As an outcome, a thematic conference could in a next step establish commonly endorsed principles and an action plan to prevent suicide and depression.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0204"></a>

<p>The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the growth of interest in health matters in today's world. It maintains the current competences in health and does not extend the legislative powers of the EU, while reinforcing the scope for supporting action for public health at EU level.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight just a few novelties that the Lisbon Treaty will bring for EU citizens in the area of health:</p>
<p>- The "well-being" of the peoples of the EU is added as an overall aim of the Union.</p>
<p>- The Charter of Fundamental Rights gets a binding legal force, including the right to health care.</p>
<p>- A strengthened basis is introduced for incentive measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross border threats to health, including measures on tobacco and the abuse of alcohol.</p>
<p>It is the Commission's intention to continue developing the EU health policy taking into account the novelties of Lisbon Treaty. The new Health Strategy for 2008-2013 outlines the areas and provides for a methodology where the Commission sees the need for EU wide action to provide health gains.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the reports from animal welfare organisations about the problems for the horses transported for slaughter.</p>
<p>The correct implementation of the Regulation on the protection of animals during transport is a top priority for the Commission.</p>
<p>Member States have the primary responsibility to give effect to EU legislation in this respect.</p>
<p>Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, Commission's experts have performed missions in Member States to verify that the competent authorities have put in place the appropriate measures to apply the EU legislation.</p>
<p>In particular, specific missions on the transport of horses were conducted in 2007 in Romania, Poland, Lithuania and Italy where significant trade of horses takes place and follow-up missions are foreseen for 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission has also initiated actions against the Member States which failed to implement measures to enforce EU rules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several new instruments to improve enforcement have been introduced by the new Regulation in 2007 such as the use of navigation system for long journeys.</p>
<p>This tool will improve controls and make targeted actions possible. For that purpose, the Commission has presented to the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health a draft Regulation setting out harmonised standards for navigation systems in December 2007. The Commission expects the standards to be adopted before summer 2008.</p>

<p>The Commission is well aware of concerns of the public about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from mobile telephony, in particular base stations ("masts"). However, it is scientifically generally accepted that most of the exposure of the public from mobile telephony comes from the use of the handsets and not from the base stations.</p>
<p>The Commission has already supported research on EMF from mobile telephony under the Framework Programmes for Research. It is continuing to do so. One epidemiological study worth mentioning is the INTERPHONE project, due to produce its final results within a few months.</p>
<p>In the absence of EU competence to legislate on the matter, the Council adopted in 1999 Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0-300 GHz), based on the best science available. Since then, the Commission has been monitoring its implementation regularly and has consulted several times its Scientific Committees to see whether it should be adapted in view of new scientific developments.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has confirmed that for Radio Frequency (RF) fields, so far no health effect has been consistently demonstrated at exposure levels below the limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and proposed in the Council Recommendation.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is funding through the Sixth Framework Programme a high-level experts group under the project EMF-NET. This group has evaluated all evidence known up to 2006 on potential health risks related to masts. Its main conclusion is that 'the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to health due to radiofrequency and microwave exposure (that is the working frequencies of the radio masts)'.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen future opinions, the SCENIHR has recommended the following research for the RF frequency range:</p>
<p>- A long term prospective cohort study to overcome limitations found in existing epidemiological studies;</p>
<p>- A specific study on the health effects of RF exposure in children;</p>
<p>- A study of the exposure distribution in the population now made possible through the advent of personal dosimeters;</p>
<p>- The replication of several experimental studies using high-quality dosimetry.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to promote research in this area. The most recent call for proposals under the Environment theme of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research contains a topic on health impacts of RF exposure in children and adolescents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0260"></a>

<p>As of April 2008, a total number of 201 variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases have been reported by 7 Member States.</p>

<p>Three cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been associated to blood transfusion. This link has been excluded in these two Spanish cases. Nonetheless, the blood issue must remain a concern for the future.</p>

<p>Two kinds of modification of the Cosmetics Directive should be distinguished. Amendments to the corpus of the Cosmetics Directive, which aims at modifying or introducing new Articles into the Directive and adaptations of the Annexes of the Directive, which are based on technical progress and new scientific knowledge. At the beginning of 2008, the Cosmetics Directive, adopted in 1976, had already been amended seven times and adapted forty eight times. The frequent adaptations result from management decisions to amend the annexes in order to implement opinions from the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products.</p>
<p>The Cosmetics Directive is based on the principle that the person responsible for placing the cosmetic product on the Community market is liable for the product’s safety. To this end, this person must keep available to the competent authorities, by means of a “product information file”, information demonstrating the safety of the product. In particular, the assessment of the safety for human health of the finished product, taking into consideration the general toxicological profile of the ingredients, their chemical structure and their level of exposure must be available within this “product information file”, which is checked on an ad hoc basis by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>The principle of manufacturer responsibility is supplemented by detailed regulation of selected individual cosmetic ingredients. Indeed, the Cosmetics Directive sets out a list of substances which cannot be included in the composition of cosmetic products (Annex II) and a list of substances which cosmetic products may not contain, outside the restrictions and conditions laid down (Annex III). The Directive also contains “positive lists” for colorants (Annex IV), preservatives (Annex VI) and UV filters (Annex VII). Concerning these groups of ingredients, only the substances listed in the respective annex are allowed for use in cosmetics in the EU. Adaptations of these annexes require the prior consultation of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products to ensure that the regulation takes into account the present state of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The modifications over a span of more than 30 years have led to inconsistent terminology and rules appearing in the wrong context. This was aggravated by the fact that the Cosmetics Directive does not contain lists of definitions and has never been codified (i.e. all the amendments have never been formally incorporated into a single legal text). Clarification was required in particular as to the notion of “person responsible for placing the cosmetic product on the market”. Lastly, the need of more coherent terms in the annexes, which is by and large a scientific and technical exercise, was stressed by stakeholders.</p>
<p>For these reasons and with the objective to significantly simplify the Community's cosmetics legislation, the Commission adopted on 5 February 2008 a proposal for a recast of the Regulation on cosmetic products. In addition, the proposal adapts the legislation in view of innovation and developments in order to ensure the safety of cosmetics products.

<p>The rules governing non-prescription (over-the-counter) drugs vary from one Member State to another. The criteria for classifying various pharmaceutical products in this category differ and there is, therefore, no uniform system of defining drugs as over-the-counter.</p>

<p>Does the Commission intend to organise a European information campaign to highlight the correct use of over-the-counter drugs since, in many Member States, these products are also available from points of sale other than pharmacies, without responsible information from a pharmacist as to their correct use, which poses a possible risk to public health?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The criteria for classification of medicinal products as prescription or as non-prescription are harmonised in Community legislation. Directive 2001/83/EC specifies the situations in which medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription. In this regard it is foreseen that a medicinal product shall be subject to medical prescription if, when utilised without medical supervision, it is frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, or if, even when used correctly, it is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health. The directive also allows for the possibility, at Member State level, to provide for certain sub-categories of medicinal products subject to special medical prescription.</p>
<p>For medicinal products authorised by the Commission, the supply status is determined in the authorisation and applies throughout the Union. For nationally authorised medicinal products, it is up to the competent authorities of each Member State to classify medicinal products when granting a marketing authorisation according to the existing criteria of Community law. Decisions on prescription status can vary from one Member State to another. The Commission's proposal to harmonise the supply status of nationally authorised medicines was not retained by the legislator during the last revision of the Directive 2001/83/EC.</p>
<p>As only national authorities have comprehensive knowledge about the medicinal products authorised in the respective Member States, the Commission does not possess the necessary information to draw up a single harmonised list of over-the-counter medicines. However, according to Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the European Medicines Agency is building up a database on medicinal products which is accessible to the general public<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. As foreseen in the Regulation, priority is given to medicinal products authorised by the Community, but the database shall subsequently be extended to include all medicinal products placed on the market within the Community.</p>
<p>The retail distribution of medicinal products is not regulated by Community law. It is up to each Member State to decide where non-prescription medicinal products are available which has led to different retail systems as the Honourable Member rightly observes. The Community law provides however for obligatory package leaflets for every medicinal product in order to ensure full information of the patient irrespective of the retail system. The package leaflet has to reflect the results of consultations with target patient groups to ensure that it is legible, clear and easy to use. In addition, for non-prescription medicinal products, instructions for use have to appear also on the labelling. The Commission considers this framework to function effectively so that a campaign at European level does not seem appropriate. If the Honourable Member possesses more detailed information, the Commission would be happy to look into this in order to see together with the Member States whether further action is needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Does the Commission consider that this wording has any bearing on the legality of measures against imports from developing countries, unequal partnership agreements with developing countries (European Partnership Agreements) and the EU’s fisheries agreements with developing countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Whereas paragraph 2 of Article 10A of the Treaty on European Union refers to the objectives, which include for the first time the eradication of poverty as a primary aim, paragraph 3 specifies that these objectives shall be pursued in the implementation of the different areas of the Union's external action and that the Union shall ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between these and its other policies. Thereby the Treaty of Lisbon gives, if and when ratified, a solid legal base to Policy Coherence for Development (PCD), a principle that is already a legal obligation under the current Treaty Establishing the European Community (Title XX on development cooperation).</p>
<p>The EU through its concept of Policy Coherence for Development aims to build synergies between the relevant internal and external policies and the development objectives. In 2005 the EU took PCD commitments in 12 policy areas<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These commitments were confirmed at the highest political level in the European Consensus on Development<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The EU has been paying considerable attention to increasing the coherence of its policies with development objectives including in the fisheries and trade sector.</p>
<p>With its trade policy the EU has established a market access regime which is quite favourable for developing countries. The average Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) import duty rate is 6.9% overall (4% for non-agriculture products and 18.6% for agriculture products)<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In the context of the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) exports from Developing Countries (DCs) enjoy a 0% duty rate or receive a 3,5 percentage points discount on this rate (see section on GSP below). Goods from Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) and the great majority of ACP Countries enjoy quota- and tariff-free access to the EU market under the 'Everything But Arms Initiative' (EBA), or under interim and full Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that also improve rules of origin.</p>
<p>However, to facilitate developing countries' closer integration into the world economy, it is important not only to reduce market access barriers, but also address a range of other factors, including those relating to individual DCs' own competitiveness and supply side capacity.</p>
<p>EU trade policy is multi-dimensional – multilateral, regional/bilateral and autonomous. Under each of these dimensions, it includes elements that respond to the particular needs of DCs and support their further development and beneficial integration into the global trading system, including through achieving an improved performance on the EU market.</p>
<p>The EU is also very actively engaged in the provision of Aid for Trade to DCs to support them in tackling the challenges of integration both at the regional and global level. In this context, regional integration is one important way to improve the position of DCs and their ability to compete in international markets, by creating larger regional markets and improving the general business environment.</p>
<p>The Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) that are being negotiated with the ACP countries are conceived as long-term partnerships based on a comprehensive approach to development. They are a tool to support regional integration and sustainable development and will therefore contribute to enhanced policy coherence. The full regional agreements to be negotiated on the basis of the interim agreements will accommodate the specific interests and situations of the regions. The comprehensive EPA concluded with the Caribbean is the example of a balanced and development-friendly agreement. Its trade provisions fully exploit, for the benefit of Caribbean countries, the asymmetry and flexibility offered by international trade law. More importantly, these provisions are embedded in a broader development framework that includes strong social and environmental chapters and detailed provisions on development cooperation.</p>
<p>Since the 2002 reform of the Fisheries Policy, the EU has undertaken to replace all existing fisheries agreements with a new generation of Fisheries Partnership Agreements by 2008. The objective of this new generation of agreements is no longer to just secure access for the European fleet, but also to support the partner country's fisheries policy with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing. A percentage of the financial contribution attached to the agreements is set aside for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over recent months various stakeholders and the media have put particular focus on healthy eating in schools. The Commission is pleased to take this opportunity to inform the Honourable Member about the current Community programme being applied in the educational establishments, and possible future programmes.</p>
<p>The school milk scheme:</p>
<p>The school milk scheme aims to provide healthy dairy products to pupils in kindergartens and primary schools (also in secondary schools if the Member State chooses) at a reduced price compared with normal commercial prices. The reduction is obtained through a subsidy granted by the Community. In 2007, the subsidy was increased to €18.15 /100 kg of milk, irrespective of its fat content.</p>
<p>The school milk scheme has an important role to play given its social and health-oriented character. By providing quality products containing important vitamins and minerals the scheme encourages a healthy way of eating while ensuring a proper nutritional education and establishing a positive long-term impact on consumption of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that in order to increase the success rate of the school milk scheme, the implementing provisions should be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission's services are reviewing the school milk scheme in view of simplifying its management and enlarging the list of beneficiaries and eligible products. The proposed changes in the system will soon be presented in the Management Committee concerned with a view, once adopted, to apply them from the beginning of the new school year.</p>
<p>The possible school fruit scheme:</p>
<p>When approving the Common Market Organisation for Fruit and Vegetables reform, the Council issued the following declaration: "In light of the dramatic increase in obesity amongst schoolchildren, which has been highlighted in the recently published Commission White Paper, the Council invites the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a school fruit scheme as soon as possible based on an impact assessment of the benefits, practicability and administrative costs involved."</p>
<p>In keeping with the Commission's commitment to better legislation, the presentation of a 'School Fruit Scheme' proposal will be conditional on the conclusions of an Impact Assessment demonstrating its value added at European level and analysing the advantages and drawbacks of different options. To help bring together the range of expertise necessary for this assessment and to facilitate the preparation of the proposal, this work has been entrusted an Inter-Service Group (ISG) made up of representatives of the Commission.</p>
<p>So far, the ISG has elaborated four options for a European "School Fruit Scheme", which have been submitted to a public consultation from 18 December 2007 to 29 February 2008. The Commission now continues to work on the Impact Assessment report, which will include and integrate the results of the public consultation. A proposal is scheduled for adoption by the Commission in July 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0181"></a>

<p>Article 169 of the Lisbon Treaty does not differ from Article 153 of the present EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Both Article 153 in the present EC Treaty and Article 169 in the Lisbon Treaty provide for a high level of consumer protection all over the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission's position on the meaning of "a high level of consumer protection" is detailed in the Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013 which it adopted on 13 March 2007<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This makes clear that the level of consumer protection is not defined in a mechanistic way (quartiles, countries, averages) but in the light of what is appropriate to ensure a proper functioning of the Internal Market both for the consumers and businesses. Thus, the strategy's main objectives are:</p>
<p>to empower EU consumers</p>
<p>to enhance EU consumers' welfare in terms of price, choice, quality, diversity, affordability and safety.</p>
<p>to protect consumers effectively from the serious risks and threats that they cannot tackle as individuals.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives the strategy identifies five priorities:</p>
<p>better monitoring of consumer markets and national consumer policies</p>
<p>better consumer protection regulation</p>
<p>better enforcement and redress</p>
<p>better informed and educated consumers</p>
<p>putting consumers at the heart of other EU policies and regulation</p>
<p>In the framework of the Treaties consumer protection does not constitute an overarching issue which takes precedence on other issues. However, the consumer protection dimension must be properly integrated into all relevant Community policies and activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Self-regulation in the media is one of the most important criteria for ascertaining whether a country is genuinely democratic.

<p>A holistic approach to the ecosystem is one of the most important basic principles of environmental and nature conservation, and of a competitive fisheries policy. All this is currently under threat from the cormorant problem. Cormorants are water birds whose numbers have been rising sharply in central Europe over the past few decades as a result of strict EU protection measures. There has been a 75-fold increase in bird populations, and this is causing severe damage to fisheries. The feeding pressure on species of fish that are already at serious risk and the damage to the European fishing industry have taken on unacceptable proportions.</p>

<p>As with all wild bird species naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States, the Cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo, is covered by the general scheme of protection of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and its deliberate capture and killing, disturbance, destruction of its nest or taking of its eggs can only be allowed by Member States in accordance with the derogation system of the directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that there are conflicts between fisheries interests and Cormorants in certain parts of the Community and it has encouraged Member States to make full use of the derogations provisions of the Birds Directive, where this is justified in the absence of alternative solutions, in order to prevent serious damage to fisheries. This derogation system is being used in different Member States.</p>
<p>While there may well be situations where Cormorants present a serious risk to endangered species of fish, the derogation system is equally applicable in this context as there is an explicit provision in the Birds Directive for use of derogations 'for the protection of flora and fauna'.</p>
<p>It is for each Member State to take the measures it considers necessary to manage populations and any conflicts that arise in relation to fisheries interests. Nevertheless, the Commission encourage co-operation between Member States on this issue and has on a number of occasions initiated discussions on this subject with the committee for adaptation to technical and scientific progress, set up pursuant to Article 16 of the Directive (the so-called Ornis Committee).</p>
<p>The Community has also supported multinational cooperative research projects aimed at reducing the conflict between cormorants and fisheries on a pan-European scale. The completed REDCAFE<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> project highlights the dynamic and complex nature of this issue not only from an ecological perspective but also within the social, cultural and economic perspectives. One of the conclusions of this project was that calls for a common standard ‘solution’ to Cormorant-fisheries ‘problems’ are perhaps premature and may well, ultimately, be inappropriate. The work started under REDCAFE is being further developed under a more recent project called INTERCAFE<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

<p>The international economic milieu is burdened by a deepening credit crisis, bouts of protectionism, and growing concerns about the impact of climate change and the formidable industrial rise of Asia (China and India, in particular) on the prices of basic commodities. The struggle for scarce resources is likely increasingly to involve good land, as the mainstay for food production. As a matter of fact, good land is turning into a strategic asset, reflecting the way other countries use non-renewable energy resources as strategic assets. Is it not ominous that, already, we are facing a visible trade-off between the prices of food and energy produced from grain? In view of this geopolitical and economic background how does the Commission envisage the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) over the longer run? Can narrowly formulated cost-benefit considerations and the risk of excessive dependency on unsecure sources of food supply lie behind a reform of the CAP?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Agricultural prices increased in 2006 and 2007 and most analysts share the view that the the market will remain firm in the medium-term. At the global scale, there is broad agreement on the reasons why demand is currently outstripping supply – production disruptions, rise in commodity demand, changes in dietary patterns, high global economic growth rates and new market outlets like biofuels.</p>
<p>This contrasts with our experience in the past, where there has been rather a problem of too much supply and too low prices, and explains the introduction of supply control measures like quotas and set aside and the general thrust for Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, since 1992, to strengthening competitiveness and increasing market orientation by moving away from a policy of price and production support to direct producer support.</p>
<p>In the context of the 2003 CAP reform, the positive market signals in many sectors can now be much better transmitted to EU farmers and can be expected to give rise to a corresponding production response. On the other hand, in the forthcoming "Health Check" of the CAP, the Commission is of the view that the various adjustments being considered, and in particular the removal of the set-aside and phasing-out of the milk quota regimes, will provide the additional land and supply potential necessary to help meet the current increase in demand.</p>
<p>In the longer timeframe, food supply and land use issues have consistently been a feature of the Union’s discussions regarding the CAP and we can expect them to remain so in discussions on the future of the CAP, which are taking place in the context of ongoing EU Budget Review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0219"></a>

<p>The Commission considers that police coopération in the EU is already producing encouraging results, although there is, of course, still room for improvement. Thus Europol, the European Police Office, is playing an important role in the fight against organised crime, as demonstrated recently by the success of Operation Koala against an international paedophile network and the dismantling of illegal printing works involved in counterfeiting euros.</p>
<p>Its future legal framework should further improve the quality of the support it provides for Member States, whilst allowing closer democratic scrutiny of its activities with the Community financing of the European Police Office.</p>
<p>Eurojust, the European Union judicial cooperation unit, also plays a prominent role by coordinating investigations and criminal prosecutions of cross-border organised crime at European level. The implementation of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002/584/JAI) should also be mentioned in that connection.</p>
<p>In addition, incorporation of the provisions of the Prüm Treaty in European law will facilitate the exchange of information, particularly on DNA data. The initial results of the treaty are very positive; several criminal cases have been solved by a comparison of national data files and, as the system becomes stronger, it should soon be more efficient.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that it is required to carry out a study, as it is with pilot projects and preparatory action. In this instance, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to have a study made of what the honorable Member calls 'a federal European police force'. Such a police force is not feasible at the moment, when the Member States are cooperating bilaterally in dealing with cross-border crime as pragmatically as possible. That is mainly the role of the police and customs cooperation centres that several Member States have set up on their common borders.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0226"></a>

<p>The Commission is pleased to see not only willingness on all sides to put aside the difficulties of the past but also agreement to start a new negotiation process for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p>It is in our common interest to see the reunification of the island and the end of this 40-year-old conflict on European soil. The division of Cyprus is unacceptable within the European Union.</p>
<p>The issues of security and presence of foreign troops on the island raised by the Honourable Member highlight the urgent need for a rapid solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p>The EU and the Commission firmly stand behind a renewed United Nations (UN) process and will fully support both communities on the island to make the necessary, difficult compromises.</p>
<p>We all know that achieving a solution will not be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and compromise, but the Commission is confident that in the end, with the guidance of the UN and the support of the EU, it will be achieved.</p>

Pastureland can and should take different forms within the EU. Excessively strict harmonisation of the rules - such as an absolute rule laying down a maximum number of 50 trees per hectare - threatens to diminish diversity and increase the quantity of unused and overgrown grassland since less and less grassland can be defined as pastureland. It has been rumoured in the media that the Commission is considering demanding repayment of up to 70 million euro, which would be a deathblow to Sweden's ambition to preserve the agricultural landscape.</p>
<p>EU aid is intended to support the agricultural landscape but must it support a European monoculture or are traditional Swedish variations acceptable?</p>

<p>Contrary to the Honourable Member's information there is no change proposed to Article 2(2) and Article 8(1) of the Regulation (EC) No. 796/2004. The definition of pastureland in force has remained unchanged since many years.</p>
<p>Under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) direct payments to farmers made in the form of the Single Payment Scheme are based on the available agricultural land on a farm.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard the financial interest of the European Union, the Commission has established rules that permit to determine eligible agricultural land and to exclude non-eligible areas.</p>
<p>The legislation referred to lays down the types of land eligible for receiving CAP payments and in particular forage / pastureland in which there is mixed vegetation and that is used for an agricultural activity.</p>
<p>To define if a land with trees falls under this category of land or is to be considered as a "forest", and is thus not eligible for aid, the Commission has established already in 2003 and made available to all Member States a document (AGRI/60363/2003) indicating that "areas of trees inside an agricultural parcel with a density of &gt;50 trees/ha should, as a general rule, be considered ineligible. Exceptions may be envisaged for tree classes of mixed-cropping such as for orchards and for ecological/environmental reasons. Eventual exceptions must be defined beforehand by the Member States". The rule is thus not new.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member can see, the Commission does not lay down an absolute rule for the whole of the Community. Sweden can thus for the future for ecological/environmental reasons define for particular types of pasture land a different threshold, if it is proven that the higher number of trees per hectare does not render the land unsuitable for agricultural activities, and thus ineligible for aid.	</p>
<p>That the land recognised in this manner is indeed compliant with the applicable EU-legislation and is thus eligible for aid will be assessed in the context of the audits under the clearance of accounts procedure.</p>
<p>In respect of the € 70 million repayment referred to by the Honourable Member, this figure cannot be traced in any decision of the Commission and therefore the Commission is not in the position to provide any details on that issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Contrary to what is indicated by the Honourable Member, the Commission fully respects the judgment of the Court of First Instance in case T-58/05 and recognises its obligation to pay half the Applicants' costs. However, like all other judgments of the Community courts in direct actions, the judgment only lays down the principle as to who shall bear which costs but does not set the amounts to be paid. Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance ("RP") lays down a procedure under which the Court can fix the amount of costs if the parties are unable to agree it. It is only if there is such an order that there is an obligation to pay a particular amount. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>In the present case, there is a dispute between the parties about what is a reasonable amount of costs. The Commission does not agree with the amount claimed by the Applicants which seems to be well in excess of what could be justified in the light of the case-law on recoverable costs in the Community courts. The Commission believes that for sound financial management requires it to keep to the principle of that case law.</p>
<p>The Commission does not however wish to force the Court of First Instance to rule on this case under Article 92 RP, if that can be avoided. It has therefore made what it regards as a reasonable offer to the applicants' counsel, taking account of the principles in the case-law, and also the particular features of the present case. Applicants remain of course free to have recourse to Article 92 RP and ask the Court to fix the amount.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0237"></a>

<p>The Action Plan "Pierre de Coubertin" annexed to the White Paper on Sport and which will guide the Commission's sport-related activities during the next years underlines in its proposed actions under chapter A.5 the need for a better use of the opportunities which sport offers to foster social inclusion in and through sport.</p>
<p>To make the implementation of the White Paper a success, the Commission will rely on an improved structured dialogue with the sport movement and an enhanced political cooperation with EU Member States.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Open method of coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion, the social inclusion strand highlights, through the 2006-2008 national strategic reports submitted by the Member States, the importance of participating in sport activities as a means to prevent and tackle social exclusion of children on the one hand, and on the other hand as a tool for promoting the social inclusion of immigrants and ethnic minorities. It should be also noted that within the context of the OMC, a number of indicators on the well-being of children have been envisaged and participation in sport activities is included in the elements to be taken into consideration. The OMC will therefore continue to include sport as a tool and indicator, without creating new structures or new working methods.</p>
<p>With regards to the practical implications of the White Paper on specific EU programmes and their calls for proposals/tenders, the Commission will be supporting social inclusion in and through sport and physical activity actions through a number of instruments available at EU level.</p>
<p>PROGRESS is the EU’s employment and social solidarity programme which started in 2007 and which will run until 2013 covering actions against discrimination, equality between men and women, employment measures and the fight against social exclusion. Ways need to be found under this programme to address the issue of accessibility to sport activities and the specific needs and situation of the vulnerable groups, as well as to take into account the special role that sport can play for disabled persons and the need to ensure gender equality in sport. Another issue to be addressed under this programme is the need to better use the potential of sport as an instrument for social inclusion, including its potential as an employment creation factor, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p>The general call for proposals 2008-2010 in the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme has included physical education and sport among its priorities. This has opened new funding opportunities for sport and physical activity projects to be supported. Promoting participation in educational opportunities through sport is thus a new priority topic for school partnerships supported by the Comenius programme and for thematic networks and mobility in the field of higher education supported by the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p>The Youth in Action Programme acknowledges the vital role that sport plays in young people's physical and social development. This is reflected in a double focus within the Programme on the role of sport as a means to promote healthy lifestyles on the one hand, and social inclusion and active citizenship on the other hand. Since the adoption of the White Paper on Sport, the integration of both dimensions has been strengthened by the addition of specific annual priorities in the Youth in Action Programme Guide, which has the status of a permanent call for proposals and is the main tool to implement the Programme. Consequently, in 2008 priority will be given to youth projects highlighting the role of sport as a tool to promote active citizenship and social inclusion or healthy lifestyles through physical activities among young people.</p>
<p>The Europe for Citizens Programme is open for a large variety of civil society organisations, including those in the area of amateur sport. Since the adoption of the White Paper on Sport, a specific annual priority on sport and active citizenship was added. Consequently, in 2008 priority will be given to applications dealing with the role of sport as a tool to promote active citizenship and social inclusion.</p>
<p>The European Integration Fund is also of relevance. Its main objective is to support the efforts made by Member States in enabling third-country nationals of different economic, social, religious, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds to fulfil conditions of residence and to facilitate their integration in to the European societies. The Integration Fund aims in particular at putting Common Basic Principles (CBP) approved at EU level on integration into practice. One of the CBP affirms that "mainstreaming integration policies and measures in all relevant policy portfolios and levels of government is an important consideration in public-policy formation and implementation" and that "Integration occurs in all spheres of public and private life. Numerous non-governmental actors influence the integration process of immigrants and can have additional value. Examples in this respect are trade unions, businesses, employer organisations, political parties, the media, sports clubs and cultural, social and religious organisations. Cooperation, coordination and communication between all of these actors are important for effective integration policy. The involvement of both immigrant and the other people in the host society is also necessary". Within the framework of the preparatory actions (INTI programme) to the establishment of this Fund, the Commission has co-financed in 2005 a project called "Integration at sports" coordinated by Zeitbild, a German organisation, in partnership with five other organisations from Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for the question regarding his concerns that EU funded projects might be connected with the Egyptian satellite provider Nilesat which is broadcasting Al-Manar TV to Europe.</p>
<p>Audiovisual cooperation as provided for in the Action Plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is essentially concerned with upgrading the regulatory framework and therefore cannot be seen as supporting objectionable content directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>There are currently no Commission funded projects in the audiovisual sector in Egypt. EU financial assistance is targeted to support the priorities as set out in the ENP Action Plan. This is clearly reflected in the National Indicative Programme (NIP) which provides € 558 million for the period 2007-2010 to assist Egypt in addressing a number of challenges of its political, economic and social reform agenda and to encourage further reform steps.</p>
<p>Both the NIP and the Annual Action Programmes which define the specific programmes on a yearly basis are prepared according to strict rules and procedures. They need to receive the positive opinion of the EU Member States, and are reviewed by the European Parliament under a scrutiny procedure.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Al-Manar TV can be received in Europe via the Egypt owned satellite provider Nilesat. The Commission fully shares concerns raised on the ground that material broadcast by this channel might amount to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>In the joint Action Plan under the ENP the EU and Egypt agreed to cooperate in the fight against intolerance, discrimination, racism and xenophobia and in the promotion of respect for religions and cultures.</p>
<p>In this context another important priority for action is to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>The appropriate mechanism for raising issues related to the fight against racism and xenophobia with Egypt is the sub-committee on political matters, including human rights, which we hope to convene for the first time in the near future.</p>
<p>Dialogue is by definition a two way process and will allow us to discuss issues of mutual concern both in the EU and in the partner country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Article 149 of Greek Law No. 3655/2008 (Greek Government Gazette No. 58 A' of 3.4.2008) concerning the administrative and organisational reform of the social security system and other insurance provisions creates a reserve entitled the Insurance Fund for Solidarity between Generations to be used after 2019 to deal with problems which the social security system may encounter in the future.

<p>According to ESA 95 accounting rules<a href="#defann_79_1" name="refann_79_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Insurance Fund for Solidarity between Generations will be classified in the Social security fund sub-sector within the General Government sector.

Moreover, as transactions between the fund and other government units (e.g. transfers of value added tax, social contributions) will be consolidated, they will have no impact on the government deficit. The rationale of these rules is that, basically, these revenue transfers appear as internal adjustments in the balance sheet of the general government, with no change in wealth, nor no flow of income.</p>

<p>As the Commission informed the honourable Member in its answer to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0051_EN.html">H-0051/08</a>, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published airworthiness directives prescribing corrective measures.</p>
<p>In particular, in October 2007 an airworthiness directive required the inspection of all aircraft of the Dash 8 Q400 type registered in the Member States of the European Union. If analysis of the results of these inspections were to show that other measures were required, the EASA would take the necessary steps.</p>
<p>The EASA has reviewed maintenance procedures in relation to the Dash 8 Q400 and considers them satisfactory. It should nevertheless be noted that the approval of the maintenance programmes of each individual operator is the task of the national authorities which are themselves subject to EASA standardisation inspections.</p>
<p>If it is fully to perform its role, the EASA has to be able to draw on all relevant information in relation to safety, particularly information from occurrence reports and investigation reports. The Commission is promoting the establishment of close cooperation between the EASA and the competent national authorities and intends to place this cooperation on a formal footing when the relevant directives are revised. This kind of cooperation is especially important as not all safety tasks have been fully transferred to the EASA and responsibilities are therefore shared between the EASA and Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In mid-February, the Chairs of the respective negotiating groups on agriculture and on industrial goods ("NAMA") issued new versions of their negotiating texts. Further negotiations have taken place in the meantime, and the Chairs may choose to reflect progress made by issuing further revised texts. World Trade Organisation (WTO) members will then have to decide whether a sound basis to move towards a Ministerial negotiation is in place. Such negotiations will seek to agree on so-called "modalities" for the final stretch of the negotiations. There is some prospect that this Ministerial meeting could be convened in the coming months.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the Commission has sought to engage with third countries, so as to find mutually agreeable solutions. In doing so, the Commission is working strictly within the limits of the mandate given by the Council on the basis of the 2003 Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Although there seems to be growing convergence among the negotiating partners on the treatment of sensitive products, there are still a number of difficult and politically sensitive outstanding issues mostly on market access which are not yet ripe for Ministerial involvement.</p>
<p>The negotiating text on NAMA from February lacked clarity on the contribution of emerging economies. The EU position is that these emerging economies should contribute to creating real new trade opportunities in industrial goods, as specified in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) mandate. This position has been made clear to other WTO Members. As regards specific sectors, the EU has tabled a proposal for a sectoral agreement on textiles (whereby trade in textiles would be further liberalised) and will continue to push hard to target tariff peaks in developed countries and emerging economies.</p>
<p>In the area of services, it will be essential that any WTO Ministerial agrees on the need for an ambitious outcome in this area. In the margins of the WTO Ministerial, a special meeting with key industrial and emerging economies will be held, where these countries will signal in which areas they can make further liberalisation offers ("plurilateral signalling conference"). The results of this Conference will therefore feed into the EC's overall assessment of the balance likely to be achieved across the negotiations as a whole.</p>
<p>Any negotiated outcome which could emerge in the weeks ahead must be comprehensive and cover issues of clear interest to the EU. The ambition in agriculture must be fully matched by the other areas of the negotiations, including NAMA, Services and Rules, as well as Geographical Indications. The Commission will not compromise on this: an overall outcome which would not be balanced would not be acceptable.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0258"></a>

Statistically, it can be postulated that this exposure might lead to an increased incidence of cancer in the population but, any increase (should it occur) would be small in relation to that which could be postulated to arise from natural radiation. Moreover, any increase would be statistically undetectable against the relatively high incidence of cancer in the population from other causes.</p>
<p>Doses to the European population have been estimated and levels of radioactivity in the environment are kept under review on the basis of the information provided by Member States under Article 36 of the EURATOM Treaty.</p>
<p>A substantial programme of research (about € 40 million) on the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident has been supported by the Commission in its Framework Programmes (mainly EURATOM) since 1990. Much of this research was carried out in the first half of the 1990s in collaboration with Belarus, Russian Federation and Ukraine. Currently the research is restricted to a few key issues, in particular the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in the three countries. More generally, the risks from radiation exposures at low doses has been and continues to be the main focus of radiation protection research in past and current EURATOM Research Framework Programmes.</p>
<p>In terms of assistance, the Commission has contributed € 250 million so far to the Shelter Implementation Plan. The Commission has also contributed € 92million to projects for treatment and management of radioactive waste and € 96 million supporting the regulatory authorities in Ukraine to ensure the proper nuclear framework.</p>
<p>The Commission has launched over 100 projects to address the environmental, healthcare and social-economic consequences, with a total contribution of € 60 million. This has included medical effect studies on radiation sickness, eco-system studies, emergency information centres, grants to create employment sources in the effected area, education on radiological culture, farming, improving professional health care, and the CORE programme in Belarus, which supports an integrated approach to the issues of social and economical rehabilitation in a context of radiological contamination</p>
<p>Projects currently being implemented include, a social-economic project, a medical project to improve peri-natal diagnostics and treatments in the Ukrainian provinces affected by the accident, a project with UNICEF to improve the healthcare of children and mothers, and a contribution of € 2.7 million to the UNDP project to “Combat the negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to recall that regulatory agencies are independent bodies from the Commission with their own legal personality. As such, each agency conducts its own communication policy. The communication campaign referred to by the Honourable Member was undertaken exclusively by agencies and is an example of coordinated communication policy, which is an approach, favoured by the Commission.</p>
<p>As regards the factual information requested by the Honourable Member – total cost, financial contribution by agencies, level of participation, duration and a success analysis – the best placed to answer is the agency that coordinated the campaign. Therefore, the Commission has asked the European Training Foundation to provide the information needed. The Commission will submit this factual data to the Honourable Member as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
