A number of Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Karim, were going to Pakistan next month to make a final plea. Now, of course, we shall turn our efforts towards ensuring Mr Hussain can return to Leeds by Christmas.</p>

<p class="contents">The annual report records our progress in handling complaints, promoting good administration and making the Ombudsman’s work better known to citizens. In total, 3920 complaints were received, a 5% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that a rise in complaints does not necessarily result from worsening administrative behaviour by the European Union’s institutions; rather, it may also reflect citizens’ increased general awareness of matters European and growing knowledge about their rights and about how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This general awareness was also observed during 2005 in the participation of citizens in the debate about the future of the European Union and the Constitution. To contribute to the furthering of this general awareness, I made intensive efforts to inform citizens about their rights and to spread the word about the positive results that have been achieved in defence of those rights. All in all, I and my staff gave over 170 public lectures, presentations and press interviews, in addition to meeting with ombudsmen, public officials and other interlocutors in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A particular feature of these communication activities in 2005 was a series of events to mark the tenth anniversary of the Ombudsman, directed at specific target groups, namely, civil society, academia, the press and the institutions themselves, including a reception in honour of the European Parliament on 27 September, which was addressed by President Borrell Fontelles himself.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2005, I was able to assist over 75% of the people who complained to me. This assistance took the form of opening an inquiry, transferring the case to a competent body, or advising on where to turn for a prompt and effective solution to the problem. I closed 312 inquiries during the year. In 36% of the cases, the inquiry revealed no maladministration. Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of a full explanation from the institutional body involved. Furthermore, even when there is no maladministration I may identify an opportunity for the institutional body to improve the quality of its administration in the future. If so, I make a further remark in closing my decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Wherever I find maladministration, I try if possible to achieve a positive-sum outcome that satisfies both the complainant and the institution. In 30% of cases my inquiry has resulted either in the institution concerned settling the case to the satisfaction of the complainant, or in a friendly solution. When a friendly solution is not possible, I close the case with a critical remark or make a draft recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the draft recommendations accepted in 2005 was a case in which the Commission granted <span class="italic">ex gratia</span> compensation to a complainant whose project it had cancelled at extremely short notice. The Commission agreed to pay EUR 56 000, the largest such settlement ever secured by the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">If a Community institutional body fails to respond satisfactorily to a draft recommendation, the Ombudsman’s ultimate weapon is a special report to Parliament. Three special reports were made in 2005: on the Council’s continuing practice of legislating in camera; on the Commission’s responsibility for children of its officials with special educational needs; and on the nature of information provided by OLAF to the Ombudsman during a previous enquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Parliament for its support as expressed in its resolutions of 4 and 6 April 2006, based on the Hammerstein Mintz and De Rossa reports respectively and concerning the first two of these special reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words about my priorities for the future. As indicated before, the first priority is to promote a citizen-centred approach by the EU institutions and bodies in all their activities. To that end I seek every opportunity to reach out to EU institutions, to encourage best practice and promote friendly solutions. The active cooperation of the institutions and bodies is essential to the success of the Ombudsman’s work for citizens. The annual report contains many examples of the institutions taking prompt action to settle cases brought to their attention and responding positively to my proposals and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">During visits to the institutions and bodies, I underlined the value of reacting promptly and constructively to complaints. The ultimate goal for all of us must be to ensure the best possible service to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken constructive steps to improve its service to citizens by overhauling its system of handling the Ombudsman’s inquiries resulting from complaints. In its communication of November 2005 the Commission outlined the new procedure to apply henceforth. Commissioner Wallström’s idea in designing the new procedure was to give individual Commissioners greater ownership of cases, while fully maintaining the valuable role of the Secretariat-General. I am particularly grateful for her efforts in bringing that concept to fruition and for her continuing commitment to its proper implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The new procedure allows individual Commissioners to get involved in cases at an early stage, when options still remain open. The speed of the new procedure already bore fruit in a case in which I found that the Commission’s response to a citizen’s infringement complaint had been unsatisfactory. I held a meeting with Commissioner McCreevy and learned from him that the Commission had taken steps to resolve that particular issue. I believe that the successful resolution of that case illustrates the value both of the Ombudsman’s role in promoting good administration in the infringement procedure and of the concept of greater ownership of cases by individual Commissioners. I wish to thank the Commission for that in the presence of Vice-President Wallström.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also revisited the question of the Ombudsman’s Statute by submitting to President Borrell Fontelles in July considered proposals for revision, in response to earlier resolutions on the Ombudsman’s annual report by this House. Overall the Statute continues to provide a good framework for the Ombudsman’s investigations and for effective cooperation with the institutions to promote good administration and fight maladministration.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes I propose are therefore limited both in number and scope. My principal objective is to ensure that citizens can have full confidence in the Ombudsman’s power to find the truth when hearing witnesses or inspecting documents.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to cooperate with Parliament to ensure that citizens’ complaints about violations of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Charter can be brought before the Court of Justice if an important issue of principle cannot be resolved in any other way. Parliament already has full rights as an institution to initiate cases before the Court. In this context, it would be useful for the Ombudsman to have the power to intervene in such cases, a power that has already been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor, with whom I have developed a close working relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to working with Mr Guardans Cambó and Mrs Matsouka as they embark upon the process of drawing up a report and opinion concerning this proposed vision in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Petitions respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">My third priority is to deepen my close cooperation with ombudsmen in the Member States through the European Network of Ombudsmen. The aim is to promote good administration throughout the Union in order that citizens can enjoy their rights under European law. I am delighted that the Committee on Petitions participates in the Network as a full member and was represented at the meeting of national ombudsmen that took place in The Hague in September 2005. Next week, a similar meeting for regional ombudsmen in the European Union, with whom I have made a commitment to meet every two years, will be held in London.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Petitions, and in particular this year’s rapporteur Mr Schwab, for their support and constructive proposals as set out in Parliament’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned today many of the matters on which the report contains wise advice to the Ombudsman. I am committed to improving the information given to Parliament and citizens about the services provided by me and by the European Network of Ombudsmen. I have already asked to appear before the Committee on Petitions whenever I submit a special report to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, I intend to put an interactive guide on our website to help complainants find the appropriate ombudsman to deal with, be it at European, national or regional level. I believe this will be of great benefit to citizens and help address the concerns rightly expressed in Mr Schwab’s report about the large percentage of inadmissible complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we successfully consolidated the Office of the European Ombudsman and moved firmly in the direction of enhancing the institution’s ability to deal effectively with complaints and inquiries from citizens of the enlarged European Union. To that end, we could always count upon the support of two of Parliament’s most senior officials who are about to retire or have just retired – Mr Priestley and Mr Garzón Clariana. Their wise counsel and assistance to the Ombudsman have been invaluable and will long be remembered.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the relationship of goodwill, trust and understanding built up over the last decade between the European Ombudsman and EU institutions constitutes a precious resource for improving the quality of public administration in Europe to the benefit of citizens. It is enormously reassuring to me, both personally and institutionally, to know that in this regard the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions are vital partners for the European Ombudsman. I intend to make the most of that partnership in seeking to contribute to the deepening of a service culture to the benefit of EU citizens. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Diamandouros, most warmly for the constructive contribution you have made in the shape of your annual report, on which I have had the privilege of reporting to this House on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, and I would like, in so doing, also to thank all the Members of this House who, by their amendments and personal comments, have played a constructive part in the report’s gestation, especially our coordinator Mr Atkins and my predecessor from last year, Mr Mavrommatis.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that you started by highlighting the need for the Ombudsman’s status to be specified in rather clearer terms in view of the increasing workload with which the public present you, and I am most obliged to you for having actually done that again today. Since we should try to draw the demarcation lines between the functions of the different European institutions as sharply and distinctly as possible, the deliberations on your letter to our President, Mr Borrell, may well bring us to a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman is an important European institution, being particularly relevant to Europe’s development and with a special importance in the eyes of the European public. He exists to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and to make it transparent. It is to him that Europe’s citizens can turn in order to complain when the institutions do not do their jobs properly; that gives him a very personal relationship with Europe, one that cannot be the same everywhere, and that is what makes his position so special.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this idea – the idea that European policy should be shaped more by practical considerations and by reference to the interests of the public – that we should, in future, take more to heart. We must focus our policies more closely on the public and thereby show them that they and their concerns – be these major or minor, important or trivial – are taken seriously, and we will accomplish that firstly by making a better job of communicating what European policy is all about, and secondly, by way of greater transparency – two important points from among those I have made about your annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions has received the European Ombudsman's annual report, which discusses his activities over the past year, and that leads me to thank you for doing a splendid job of work. You have been in office since 1 April 2003, and your labours are being crowned with success.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the report that this House has produced is a very balanced one; I have endeavoured to examine the Members’ amendments and, where I thought it possible, to incorporate them. I believe that the report is comprehensible to the public, and that is the most important thing, but, following the vote in committee, I assumed that not all the amendments could be re-submitted, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that it should reject them. For that I ask your understanding. We have spent a long time trying to compromise on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">You have already set out the most important points from your report. The year 2005 saw a large number of complaints – the largest, indeed, ever made to the Ombudsman – and the first thing that indicates is that more and more people are taking an active interest in the EU and in the way it works.</p>
<p class="contents">What is shocking, though – and this is something to which you referred – is the continuing large number of complaints – amounting to some 70% of those made – that are not actually within your remit, very often because the people making them do not know with any certainty to whom they actually need to address themselves, and it is for that reason that I very much welcome your statement to the effect that you want an online form set up on your homepage as a guide to the right institution; that would certainly be useful to all those who want to contact you online.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows, then, that the powers and responsibilities of the institutions need to be demarcated even more clearly in order that the public may understand who, in the European Union, is responsible for dealing with what, and you can help to make the tangled undergrowth of institutions and their powers more transparent, something that is, of course, in the first instance a task for Parliament and for its Members in the electoral districts in the relevant regions, but you can play your part too.</p>
<p class="contents">We extend a very warm welcome to the European Network of Ombudsmen and similar bodies, which take quite different forms from one Member State to another, and we have, for that reason, particularly highlighted their public information events.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the substance of the various complaints, they focus primarily on a lack of transparency, and so, in that the report repeats the Ombudsman’s demands – made in his special report on the subject – for all meetings of the Council in its legislative capacity to be open to the public, you have served the cause of democracy and transparency in Europe well.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, though, need more transparency if the democratic functioning of the European Union is to be guaranteed, and hence, in our report – and in saying this, I am perhaps addressing you, Commissioner Wallström, more than anyone else – we call for the ‘europa.eu’ Internet portal to be redesigned as a means of access to all the institutions and for a clear guide to the various European institutions – rather than a catalogue of all the European Union’s activities – to be positioned on the homepage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to give voice to another thought, namely that it was in January that you presented your annual report for the past year, yet it is only now – in November of the following year – that we are debating it. We in the Committee on Petitions should endeavour to discuss these reports as soon as possible after they are published. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, for his work on the European Ombudsman’s report on his activities in 2005. This is an important report from Parliament on the general principles, the state of play and future development of cooperation between the Ombudsman and other EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, on his annual report. I am happy, as always, to hear Mr Diamandouros confirm his commitment to ensuring the highest standards of administration in the European institutions, and that is a commitment the Commission shares.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely support Mr Schwab in his endorsement of the role of the Ombudsman as an external monitoring mechanism for sound administration. Through his work, the Ombudsman contributes to the promotion of good administration. I am convinced that, through their cooperation with the Ombudsman, EU institutions are helped in fostering a citizen-oriented approach to their daily work. That means ensuring greater transparency of the EU decision-making process and working to develop best practices to meet citizens’ expectations and safeguard their rights. This is about bridging the gap between institutions and EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on three specific points in the report. Firstly, I think that the cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Commission has developed well in recent years. As pointed out in the report, the Commission uses a new internal procedure empowering each Commissioner to adopt and transmit communications to the Ombudsman. I am happy that both the Ombudsman and Mr Schwab welcome this innovation in their reports. In addition, the Commission has adapted its internal rules to speed up the handling of its replies to the Ombudsman. The Commission will continue to develop its cooperation with the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur suggests that a similar empowering procedure be introduced for the handling of petitions. While the Commission will continue to work closely with the Committee on Petitions, that is not a possibility that the Commission envisages. The Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have distinct roles, each with its own value to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report mentions the Europa website. It is one of the most visited websites in the world and it has become quite complex to navigate. It is in that light that the Commission is well on its way towards refurbishing its own part of the Europa portal. The ultimate objective is to transform the Europa website into a more user-friendly, well-structured and coherent web portal. It will be multilingual at appropriate levels and the presentation will be more oriented to citizens and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and finally, the decision to revise the Ombudsman’s statute rests with the European Parliament, with the approval of the Council. The Commission is, however, consulted and closely follows developments relating to the proposal, including those in the committees concerned. The Commission is currently examining the proposal in detail, and has been in contact with the Ombudsman’s office to seek clarification on some aspects of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I understand that next year the Ombudsman intends to include a few star cases in his annual report. These are, as I understand it, cases where the handling of complaints by the EU institutions has been exemplary, regardless of whether maladministration occurred. I think that is an excellent initiative and I also look forward to seeing next year’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Diamandouros, because the new facts that he brings to light in the position he holds are reference points for the trust that the citizens place in the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I acted as rapporteur for the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2004 and I wish to point out that, compared with that year, during which complaints rose by 53% over the previous year, in 2005 the Ombudsman received a total of 3 920 complaints, in other words an increase in the order of 5%. This does not mean that there are more cases of maladministration on the part of the institutions of the European Union, but that the citizens are more informed as to their rights. An important factor for the efficacy of the institution of the Ombudsman is its cooperation with the institutions of the European Union. I would refer by way of example to the regular updates and meetings between Mr Diamandouros and the Committee on Petitions and its bureau. The Ombudsman's annual report illustrates, among other things, the efforts being made by the Ombudsman and the Commission, of course, to broaden and further strengthen the network of national and regional ombudsmen, by developing exchanges of information for best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The participation of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament in this network is important and would facilitate practical cooperation between the European institutions and the national and regional ombudsmen and would allow regular contacts with the committees on petitions of the national parliaments and with the ombudsmen of the Member States to be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare the Ombudsman's reports for 2004 and 2005, we see that the result was positive, so that we can concentrate on the points in which the Committee on Petitions is particularly interested. Furthermore, we can see in this way the essential role he plays and the progress made within one year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s report, particularly the executive summary, is, I believe, an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens. It is clear, concise and to the point. Transparency is, I believe, the key to European democracy and its main building block.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman’s role, reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him. I am not at all concerned about the fact that many of these are not directly his responsibility. That is a reflection of his success in bringing his office to the notice of the public and perhaps also an indication of the inadequacies of other institutions in making clear who they are and how to access them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should not expect citizens to find their way through the maze of EU institutions. They have more important things to be doing with their lives. When they have a complaint to make, they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them. I think that the citizen’s right to make a complaint is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The action of the Ombudsman in referring those cases for which he does not have direct responsibility to the appropriate institution is an excellent way of dealing with such complaints. I believe it should be followed by other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman’s statute, there is clearly a need for a review. I welcome the Ombudsman’s initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future.</p>

I would also like to thank Mr Schwab for his very competent report and analysis of the Ombudsman’s report. There is little to say except that everything seems to be going well in the sense that our citizens are more aware of the Ombudsman’s activities. If the numbers of complaints are rising owing to an increasing awareness of what is possible and an awareness of Europe, then that is helping to bring our citizens closer to us. That is what we should be all about. Reports of this type help give us a snapshot of what is going on and of how we can do things better in the future, and this report sets out many of those lessons.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to centre my remarks on an issue already mentioned by other speakers, which is that if we want to be citizen-centred then we have to ensure that our citizens can make a complaint easily, perhaps via a one-stop shop. Simply having a good website may not be the answer.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there are a lot of people dealing with complaints, problems and issues. We have the Ombudsman’s very good service, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions, the Commission itself, which accepts complaints, and ourselves as MEPs, who receive constituents’ case-work, as well as SOLVIT and EUROJUST. I fear that some EU citizens who apply to one of these bodies only to be referred to another will fall by the wayside and give up. We need to think about ways in which we can bring these various strands together so that our citizens feel that their issues are being answered promptly and that they are being directed to the right recipient. That is something we should think about for the future.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to begin by expressing my agreement with Mrs Wallis’s proposal and with the proposal for a European one-stop shop for the citizens’ complaints. This one-stop shop could bring together SOLVIT, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions and would be responsible for channelling the citizens' complaints to the appropriate institution. We cannot expect the public to be able to navigate such a complicated labyrinth as the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My only regret about the report, which in general is very positive, is its consideration of the third special report by the Ombudsman, which was going to be a report on OLAF and which has been blocked by the Conference of Presidents. Some of the wording of the Schwab report appears to legitimise this House’s Conference of Presidents’ attempts to hinder the Ombudsman’s work of monitoring European bodies, including OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular we should thank the Ombudsman for some of his efforts, such as those relating to the environment, where there is great popular concern. I would especially like to mention the case of the industrial port of Granadilla, in the Canary Islands, where the Ombudsman has tried to ensure more rigorous application of the Habitat Directive, with a degree of success.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to highlight the special report on the transparency of the Council when acting as legislator, a report that I personally was involved in preparing. We can see that there is slow, gradual, but real progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by making it clear that the role of Parliament's Committee on Petitions in no way clashes with the role of the Ombudsman, but rather their roles are complementary. The Ombudsman monitors the European institutions in their day-to-day work, while the Committee on Petitions plays the role of direct intermediary between the citizens and the body of Community law. There should be more fluid day-to-day cooperation between them, with more information and more contact.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your report, Mr Schwab, and thank you, Mr Diamandouros, for your very intensive, wide-ranging and important work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, I believe that the time has come to take concrete initiatives to make such improvements. Some interesting ones have already been mentioned, such as the online form and the better demarcation of the competences of the different bodies, but I believe that we should be rather more ambitious. We should move toward a code of good administrative conduct for all of the European institutions, and the one-stop shop, which Mr Hammerstein mentioned, can also be important.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports note that 24% of complaints relate to a lack of transparency. I believe that we must make an effort to promote a public debate in Europe on how close a relationship citizens have with the institutions and to ensure that those institutions act in an entirely transparent fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to mention another problem that the members of the Committee on Petitions should resolve. Many of the citizens’ complaints received relate to large works, large infrastructures, that are carried out in the European Union without the mandatory environmental impact study. Sometimes the European Commission is late in issuing a report, since the damage caused by certain absolutely monumental works is already irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Commission must act much more quickly, in order to prevent that damage from having an horrendous environmental impact. To this end, I believe that we should all do our bit to create speedy assessment mechanisms for these kinds of works, in order to prevent that damage.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Network of Ombudsmen is important, because it may be the key to providing many solutions that can prevent complaints from the citizens of Europe and, where necessary, improve the way we respond to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you said, I am speaking on behalf of the Union for the Europe of the Nations Group as well as in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, which makes me particularly qualified to speak on this matter. I would, of course, like to thank Mr Schwab for his report, which was very well prepared and subsequently adopted in our committee, and I therefore fully agree with everything Mr Schwab has said. I would particularly like to thank Mr Diamandouros. He does his job extremely well and this is fully appreciated as, if I may remind you, he has been re-elected to his post by a majority of over ninety percent of the votes cast.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much appreciate the contact that Mr Diamandouros has with the European public, outside of his main work as Ombudsman. He has attended over 170 meetings. I myself was present at one of these meetings in Poland, which was attended by over 150 people who had come to see who he was, what he had to say and what message the European Ombudsman himself had for them. This is one of the achievements of Mr Diamandouros’ hands-on approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone has already mentioned, I would like to say that the active involvement of the European Ombudsman is closely linked to, shapes and reflects a greater awareness of the rights of the European Union citizens, and that they are more aware of these rights precisely thanks to the activities of the European Ombudsman. The Committee on Petitions, of which I am the chairman, works closely with the European Ombudsman. We have similar competences, but they are not identical. It is therefore important to be aware of the differences between the competences of the Ombudsman and those of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">If the President will allow me to extend my speech by a few more seconds, I would like to draw your attention to one more matter. The Committee on Petitions is a European Parliament body. It is therefore very regrettable that the European Parliament and its bodies sometimes bypass our committee in their dealings with the Ombudsman. There was an instance of this on 15 March 2006, when the European Parliament signed a new agreement with the Ombudsman over the heads of the committee which I chair, and which was not involved in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a striking lack of transparency concerning their activities and a lack of effective control over the way we spend our money. The infringement of citizens’ right to information is particularly damaging. A glaring example of this was the campaign to promote the so-called Constitution for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In March of last year I addressed a complaint to the European Ombudsman regarding the use of EUR 8 million to promote the European Constitution. This funding was only available to supporters of the Constitution. This fact was confirmed by a European Commission spokesman on 16 February 2005. In response to questions from the media on whether European Union money could be used to fund a campaign organised by opponents of the European Constitution, he said, and I quote: ‘The Commission is treating the European Constitution like its baby and cares about its ratification’ and the ‘European Union’s Office for Official Publications is not going to print pamphlets written by opponents of the Constitution.’</p>
<p class="contents">These frank statements by Commissioner Wallström’s spokesman explicitly show that opponents of the Constitution did not, and still do not, have any opportunity to present their views. For example, before the referendum in Spain, the European Commission spent EUR 1 million on printing 5 million pro-constitutional pamphlets and stickers, which were handed out in public places. There was a deliberate move to avoid providing information on the negative aspects of the European Constitution. This was therefore a blatant infringement of the European citizens’ fundamental right to equal access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">After investigating my complaint for a year, the European Ombudsman decided that the European Commission did not infringe the citizens’ right to equal access to information. In that case, who did?</p>
<p class="contents">When they see their credibility collapsing and disintegrating, the European Union institutions resort ever more frequently to mendacious propaganda and to funding and imposing a single, ‘true’ vision of European unity. I appreciate the Ombudsman’s efforts in the fight to achieve transparency concerning the work of the European institutions, but there is still a long way to go. Dinners with representatives of the bodies the Ombudsman are investigating are not enough to increase the credibility and authority of his office. This office should be a real Ombudsman defending our rights, an Ombudsman who speaks out for the truth and defends the citizens from the ills of the European Union machine. However, such work requires courage and autonomy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has been signally successful in his activities, but ironically his success has provoked more interest. That, however, is actually good news for the task of the Committee on Petitions, to which the Ombudsman reports and whose joint work with him is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree entirely with Diana Wallis that is essential that EU citizens are made more aware of the facilities for the redress of grievances, particularly those that exist through the auspices of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I, with everyone else, congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his achievements, especially, if I may say so, on his determination, past, present and future, in explaining the use of his powers to the new Member States and encouraging them to use his services. We have plans to do the same on behalf of the Committee on Petitions and I should say that the combination of a Commissioner from Sweden, where the Ombudsman originated, and an Ombudsman from Greece, where democracy originated, is a powerful and influential one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly interested in the Ombudsman’s special reports. He will know that I am the rapporteur <span class="italic">manqué </span>for one such report, relating to OLAF. He must know, as must this House, that I will not allow this issue to go away. Transparency and open dealing must be paramount and this report must and will be dealt with when the judicial process is completed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the chairman said, the Committee on Petitions is of increasing importance and must soon cease to be the Cinderella committee at the end of the list of limited significance. The activities of the Ombudsman and the Petitions Committee are many, various and growing exponentially. They must be recognised by Parliament and the Conference of Presidents and given the authority they deserve.</p>

I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Wallström and thank her for her tireless efforts to facilitate communications between the citizen and the European institutions and implement quick, simpler and interactive solutions. I would also, of course, like to congratulate Mr Schwab in particular on the in-depth way in which he has dealt with these issues, which may seem routine but which certainly represent progress on the road towards ‘more Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased with the progress in the work of mediation and response to the citizens’ demands and I am particularly pleased and interested to note the friendly solutions proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge Mr Diamandouros to develop a format for the peaceful settlement of disputes that serves as a model for Europe in general. I am sure that the democracy enjoyed by both the Administration and the citizens will be increased by means of a better and more transparent administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted with the explicit proposal to offer the Internet sites for all of the institutions in all of the Union's official languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Given his constructive approach, I share Mr Schwab’s concern about the need to improve cooperation, with no obstacles or misunderstandings, between Parliament and the European Ombudsman, while preventing any overlapping between them: the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman are still seeking their own directions, and it is therefore positive that the Committee on Petitions should participate in the European Network of Ombudsmen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, perhaps because I am not aware of the scale of the issue, I am rather concerned that the future of the Ombudsman appears to lie in the courts, and I hope that that does not mean that improving information and, particularly, the efforts to achieve the peaceful settlement of disputes will be abandoned early. The proposed judicialisation is not the best way to improve relations between the citizens and the European public Administration, and I would refer to the existing examples that have already been mentioned.</p>

I share his concerns that it is a little late in the day to be debating this issue, but I suppose it is better late than never!</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman is the watchdog of the system. I would prefer to think of him as a Rottweiler, which is what we need, rather than a tamer breed! My Irish colleagues will giggle at the ‘Rottweiler’ description because politically speaking we have one of those in our national parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has an important role to play and I do not share the concerns of those who maintain that 70% of complaints fall outside his remit. As others have said, this reflects the fact that there is a huge amount of frustration and people need somewhere to turn. It is important to underline that. I am pleased that the Ombudsman, in his wisdom, does not turn them away, but actually assists them. He should continue to do that. Others might not agree, but that is part of his job, and we need that flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I compliment the Ombudsman for trying to promote his work. There is an onus on all of us in this House to help him in that regard, even if I regard my own office – and I think other colleagues feel similarly – as a one-stop shop. At the end of the day, I hope MEPs are the first port of call for citizens who have problems. Mrs Wallis’ proposal to set up a one-stop shop is a good one, but let us not forget that we as elected representatives are also here to obtain information for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman should bear in mind that we in this House often experience as much frustration as the public when it comes to getting information from the Commission. There is a duty on administrators to see themselves as servants of the public and not as protectors of the system. If necessary, we will have to train people and change their culture. I would be interested to know whether the Ombudsman has looked into the attitudes of those who are at the root of problems. In other words, in the complaints he has upheld, is a bad attitude evident among administrators? If so, we should do something about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank all those involved again, and I hope the Ombudsman’s workload increases exponentially, as it should. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst these complaints are not always justified, of course – as is also mentioned in this extensive report – this is still a large proportion, and so there is much room for improvement. The rapporteur is right to point out that, according to the Treaty of Nice, every European institution must seek to be as open and accessible as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The bulk of the complaints are directed at the Commission, of course, because they are most closely involved with the citizens, although it is in actual fact mainly the Council of Ministers that is causing the delays. In the old-fashioned culture of paternalistic power and the top-down approach, openness can wait. Nevertheless, confidence is a key condition if policy is to be effective, and the world needs a strong EU that is carried by its citizens, because there is more at stake than a little governing.</p>
<p class="contents">Would Europe want to stand up for globalisation of a different kind, social, sustainable and fair development? Only if Europe commits to this can the EU truly gain confidence. Only a Europe, though, that offers openness in every decision will be given it. If we want to boost Europeans’ confidence in their own European Union permanently, openness and accessibility are absolute political priorities. I would urge Europe to throw the doors open wide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, I wish him every success in that.</p>
<p class="contents">You, too, Mr Diamandouros, have an important part to play, particularly since you are, in my view, the relay that connects the public to the European institutions; it is to you that citizens turn with any concerns they may have with them, and your role is to settle grievances and you do try to find solutions. Last year saw 3 920 submissions made, and in 75% of cases, it proved possible to offer the complainants a solution by setting investigations in motion or referring them onward to the relevant departments; that really is a very high percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, too, has a very important part to play in this, in that it keeps on trying, by means of various transparency initiatives, to demonstrate how open it is, and I can do no other than encourage it in that, and you, Madam Vice-President, in carrying on down this road. The fact is that, as we know, great institutions – not only the Commission, but also those in the business world – have a tendency to become self-sufficient and to acquire a life of their own into which it is difficult for outsiders to get an insight, so press on with your transparency initiative, I beg you.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say to our Polish friend is that I think it extremely hypocritical to accuse the Commission of providing only such information on the constitutional treaty as shows it in a favourable light. The publications I have seen were all kept relatively objective and were a necessary means of informing the public as to what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It really is hypocritical to demand, on the one hand, more information, and, on the other, to ask that some of it be curtailed. That is why we must press on together down this road in order to be able to build a Europe in which we can all share.</p>

<p class="contents">At this point, we should say a word of thanks to Professor Diamandouros, who is in charge of this institution. The public nature of the Ombudsman’s activities deserves praise. Nevertheless, it is worrying that 70% of all complaints lodged still remain outside of the scope of competence of the Ombudsman. This is nearly always a result of the fact that the essence of the complaints are not directed against the bodies or institutions of the European Union. It shows that the division of competences between the institutions and the decision-making processes are still unclear to many European Union citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to define and clearly delineate the role of the Ombudsman and the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions in a way that is clear to the citizens of the European Union. Last year, the number of complaints rose by 5% over the previous year. This may reflect the fact that the Ombudsman's activities are more widely acknowledged, or it may be linked to the fact that not all European Member States have this type of institution, which means that many people go to the European Ombudsman with problems involving national, regional and local administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman must increase its efforts to provide the public with reliable information. Citizens must have easy access to information in their own mother tongues. This will allow them to feel that they are card-carrying citizens of the European Union, whose welfare is important and whose voices count.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, on an excellent report. I think that he will continue in his role as a watchdog, or indeed a rottweiler, of the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his worthy representation and effective conduct of the role of defender of transparency and honest administration in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps next year we shall examine his annual report in Parliament earlier and more quickly and the Committee on Petitions, as the competent committee, will be in direct contact with the Ombudsman, so that it can be informed about the procedure for the signing of interinstitutional agreements between him and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 6 of the Schwab report justifiably expresses our regret about the signing of a new agreement with effect from 1 April 2006, in other words before the report for 2005 had been approved. The Ombudsman also submitted on 11 July a proposal for the adaptation of his statute. Paragraph 13 of the Schwab report welcomes the fact. However, I should like to comment that the issues which he touches on in his request are particularly sensitive and his arguments are particularly weak. The ban on intervention in cases pending before the courts is something which cannot be contested on the basis of the Treaties. Community servants must be bound by professional secrecy. We have competent institutions for examining human rights; but we too, as a parliament controlled by the citizens, have the jurisdiction to investigate and file complaints. There is a plethora of extrajudicial procedures. The Ombudsman has numerous duties and one can only hope that he has time with the staff in his department, which fortunately is constantly increasing – from 38 to 51 and 57 in 2006 – to respond to the increased number of complaints. If, however, the Ombudsman condemns the lack of transparency in the work of the Council, we call on him in Amendment 1 – which I call on you to support – to check, not after specific complaints from citizens, but on his own initiative, the transparency with which EPSO recruitment competitions are carried out and the recruitment methods of the European agencies, including his own department. This is an issue which touches on the sensitivity mainly of the new Europeans, who take part in competitions and interviews in their thousands and do not have the right to find out why they failed.</p>

I take heart from the support I have from this particular body, whose cooperation I value enormously. I also commit myself and my staff to trying to move forward, to doing more of the same and to doing more of what I am asked to do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible for me to cover all the remarks that have been made, but let me address some of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I am very grateful for the support I have received concerning the Statute. With the permission of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I would like to clarify two points concerning this, which I will do in Greek, since she addressed me in Greek. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, Mrs Panayotopoulos, I wish to assure you that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the European Ombudsman's mandate and that this is a matter of particular concern to us, which we are monitoring very, very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my recommendations are concerned, I also wish to assure you that the request I make ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker was cut off by the President, who drew his attention to a problem with the interpretation)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">I apologise, Mr President. I did not realise there was a problem with the interpretation. I thought it was an attempt to test my ability to speak in my native tongue!</p>
<p class="contents">With the President’s permission I would like very briefly to assure Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and the House that the European Personnel Selection Office is already within the Ombudsman’s mandate and we devote a great deal of time to questions concerning recruitment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Statute, I want to make it absolutely plain that the Ombudsman is not, under any circumstances, asking for the right to initiate cases before the Court. That is clearly not for us to do. The Court and the Ombudsman are separate. What we are asking for is the right to intervene before the Court, as that right has been given to the European Data Protection Supervisor in cases of major violations of fundamental rights. That is a fundamental difference. I repeat, we are under no circumstances seeking to have access to the Court in a way that would in fact go beyond my mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the encouragement concerning a Single Code and I am working with Commissioner Wallström to see whether that would be possible; she referred to that in her own remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Sir Robert Atkins in particular for his determination to see that all the special reports submitted to this House by the Ombudsman will be dealt with eventually. I hope that will be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The one-stop shop idea is a very important one. I would very much look forward to working with Mrs Wallström and with other institutions and perhaps launching a brainstorming and reflection procedure about that idea, so that we can serve citizens better. I want to stress that the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions are complementary organisations; I am very grateful to that committee and we will work with it constantly with a view to moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have a few comments to make if I may. The inadmissibles are indeed very important and we shall try to reduce them. But we will continue to help all citizens who come to us for the wrong reason by using the Network of Ombudsmen of the European Union as a mechanism of transferring complaints to them, thereby helping those citizens and in a sense trying to apply subsidiarity in non-judicial mechanisms. We work with our colleagues at national and regional level to serve citizens better, which includes the transfer of inadmissibles.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs McGuinness very much for her very laudatory remarks. I view myself as an external mechanism of control over the administration and therefore, if everything else fails, yes, I will also have to act as a Rottweiler. Leaving aside the Irish overtones of that – I do not want to get into theological implications here, or divinity – I think that is, however, the ultimate step. The first step, on which I am working very closely with the Commission, with the Secretary-General of the Commission and with Mrs Wallström, is to reach out to the institutions, to reach out to the Commission, and help them understand what their obligations are. It is indeed to help them realise that a change of culture is extraordinarily important if the European institutions, including the Commission, are in fact to understand that the institutions exist to serve the citizen and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for giving me the time to make these clarifications. Once again, I want to thank this House for its very encouraging and very warm reactions to my report.</p>

<p class="contents">In 2005, the European Ombudsman submitted a special report to Parliament, because he had found an unjustified discrimination with regard to funds for members of EU staff with children with special educational needs. In his draft recommendation, he asked the European Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that parents, whose children are excluded from the European Schools because of their degree of disability, should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children. Parliament's resolution on the matter requested that the Commission respect the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary steps were not taken, however, since unfortunately in the course of school enrolment this autumn, it once again happened that a pupil with special educational needs was refused admission. This practice, which violates respect for human rights, has led to several families living apart and having to leave Brussels, and often the European institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the EU Treaty, the right to education, equal treatment and the prohibition against any form of discrimination constitute the founding principles of Community law. I therefore request that, having regard to the Ombudsman's recommendation and Parliament's resolution on this matter, the European Commission create the conditions for equal educational opportunities for children with special educational needs, in line with European principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I replied to my friend, ‘I think you are being unfair. I believe that Mrs Wallström is making an effort to create a good information and communication policy and furthermore, call me naïve, but on several occasions she has shown me that that is her objective. The problem is that the circumstances are not currently right for organising such an information and communication strategy in the European Union.’</p>

<p class="contents">Let us therefore take a further step – and this is the approach I took when drawing up this report – and let us try to change the way things have been until now, because every time we meet to talk about the information and communication strategy, we make a load of general recommendations that come to nothing. Let us try to achieve what we do not yet have. Let us create that legal basis that will enable us to act much more effectively in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">On looking into it, I discovered that there was only one formula for creating that legal basis: the application of Article 308 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">When the circumstances in which that Article could be applied were explained to me, I was tempted to say, ‘it is impossible, we are not going to be able to do it’. There need to be three circumstances in place that are very difficult to bring together: firstly, the Commission must ask for it; secondly, Parliament must agree; and thirdly – and the most difficult circumstance to bring about – the Council must approve it unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">I spoke to Mrs Wallström and she told me that the Commission was in agreement. I spoke to all of the shadow rapporteurs, and they told me that Parliament could be in agreement. In the interinstitutional group we had the opportunity to hear the opinion of the Minister who, on that occasion, was representing the Council, and she told us that she was in a position, not to guarantee unanimity in the Council, since that is something she could not do, but at least to say that she believed there could be such unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">All the elements are therefore in place at the moment, but that will be very unlikely to happen again at a later date. In politics, the most important thing is to take advantage of the circumstances in place at a particular time.</p>
<p class="contents">We currently have an opportunity that we will probably not have again in the future: a very good opportunity to improve things, to create a legal basis. That does not mean that it will cure all our ills, but it will clearly be a step forward. We have just two possibilities: either to accept it or to reject it. I propose that we accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Prets, Christa, I would ask you please to help me, because I know from Mr Corbett’s speech that your party is going to vote against the application of Article 308. Mr Corbett believes that there is another way to achieve that legal basis. There is not. Or if there is, tell me what it is. Let us negotiate. Let us talk about it. There has been no amendment from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs offering us an alternative. Gérard Onesta, shadow rapporteur for this report, whom I thank for speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/Euroopean Free Alliance, has understood that we have this opportunity and has agreed that we should take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, Christa, that there was only one vote in the Committee on Culture and Education against this report, which calls for the application of Article 308. Let us try to take advantage of it. This is not an ideological issue. I have praised Mrs Wallström, who is not from my party, because I believe that she is doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Bono, because he has been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Culture and Education. I know that you would help me if you could. I also know, however, that group discipline sometimes imposes views that are not the right ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to reflect between now and the vote, so that we can have this report adopted. I would earnestly beg you. This is not an ideological issue. It is a political issue. One of timing. It must be now or it will be extremely difficult in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the best way to organise the policy we want. Otherwise, members of the Committee on Culture and Education present here today, we will meet every year and hear a list of good intentions, which, as well as costing a lot of money, will be communicated by us to the Commissioner at the last moment, and we will have no control. We shall have little idea of how the money will be spent or of what use it will be. We will be going round and round in circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bono, Mrs Prets, Mrs Badia I Cutchet, I can see you here, you are members of the Committee on Culture and Education: we discussed the report and approved it in that committee, with just one vote against. Mr Corbett’s amendment did not succeed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. We have not been provided with any alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us respond to the political opportunity we are being offered. I would earnestly beg you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, for his hard work, the positive tone of this report and the support it gives to the Commission’s ideas. However, I must say that I hope his friend is a better journalist than he is an expert on the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission adopted the White Paper back in February we said that we intended to open a new chapter as regards communication between the European Union and its citizens. As we put it, the new communication policy should move from monologue to dialogue. It should put ears on the European Union. It should move from institution-centred communication to a citizen-centred approach based on people’s fundamental right to information and to be heard. It should move from Brussels-based communication to a decentralised approach and from an accessory tool to a real European policy on an equal footing with other EU policies. In other words, it should be a policy in its own right.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me directly to the issue of the legal basis for the communication policy, which is, I agree, an issue here, and a very difficult and controversial one at that. It is a means of giving legitimacy to what we do and creating commitment, and it would set out the principles by which we worked on communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a citizens charter, or a code of conduct as we have called it, to which the institutional actors, including Member States, could subscribe on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The report suggests a somewhat different approach, inviting the Commission to work on a draft interinstitutional agreement. It also urges the Commission to explore the possibility of launching a genuine Community programme for information and communication on Europe on the basis of Article 308 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing, as you recommend, to explore all possibilities for finding a sound basis for joint action, ranging from a citizens charter to a formal legal base. I am more than happy to embrace those ideas, again in order to give legitimacy to what we do.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that your report acknowledges the importance of civic education and citizens’ involvement in the decision-making process. It calls on the Commission to ensure consultation with the public at an early stage of policy-shaping, and this view is also shared by a broad cross-section of civil society. We shall certainly take action in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all more than aware of the crucial role that the media – press, television, radio and the internet – play in contemporary democracy. We all know that a large part of the communication gap has to do with the fact that European affairs are quite marginal and often misrepresented in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to be clear on this issue, because you have asked the Commission to define with the greatest precision what role it would like to assign to the media. However, the problem cannot be addressed from that angle. The only role the media can have is the one that our democratic tradition has entrusted them with, which is to inform citizens in an independent, pluralistic and critical manner on European issues in the same way as domestic issues. The problem is how to create the conditions for this to happen, and this will be the theme of a stakeholders’ conference that will take place in Helsinki in December, as a follow-up to the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Another central theme of the White Paper is understanding public opinion. Our societies are experiencing unprecedented changes due to higher internal mobility, migration and globalisation. Public opinion has become more and more complex to define and comprehend. Over the last 30 years, the Eurobarometer has been a very useful tool for measuring public opinion, perceptions and orientations. However, we feel that much more can be done. I take note of your hesitations as regards our proposal for an observatory for European public opinion, but we can adopt a more pragmatic approach or step-by-step approach to this matter. For example, the idea of setting up networks of experts to exchange best practices and exploit synergies received considerable support during the public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not touch upon the many other issues that you rightly address in your comprehensive report, such as the role of Member States, the importance of the regional and local level, the involvement of national parliaments or the responsibilities of political parties, which are all crucial, of course. We fundamentally agree on those issues, and I am very glad that the scope of my mandate allows me to work out concrete proposals to help realise these common aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report is a milestone in the process we have started with the White Paper. It contains strong encouragement to move forward on the basis of ever-closer cooperation between our two institutions. The Commission will issue its final report on the White Paper next spring. That report will set out a series of concrete proposals, to be followed up by operational plans of action. The way ahead is still long and far from easy, but I am confident that, with your support, we can make a real change in the way Europe communicates with its citizens by giving them a real say and by listening to them. An EU communication policy can be a tool to strengthen democracy and I look forward to the debate on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should be examining the way we communicate with our citizens, and that means we have to be absolutely clear about the language that we use. It must be plain, simple, clear and precise. It is no use talking about tools and barometers. People switch off. We need to be passionate about what we do and how we do it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is arguably the most successful European institution, and yet we are criticised and we very rarely defend ourselves. There are 25 Member States with different political persuasions and cultures, acting together for the common benefit of 450 million citizens – absolutely brilliant! But do we sell and promote what we do effectively? We do not. Do we ensure that national parliaments engage in their scrutiny role? No, we do not. We merely stand back and take the criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me grab four seconds. I urge the Commission to go forward with its proposal for the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. It is not in this report. It is accepted in the Commission work programme. We can only be held accountable and be effective if people understand what we do for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is high time we had such a policy, judging by the Eurobarometer findings which show the extent of the gap between our institutions and the expectations of our citizens. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs also welcomes the Commission's focus on two-way communication, which is very much a new departure, involving the institutions addressing the public and the public addressing the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that, after having proclaimed this excellent principle at the start of the White Paper, the Commission has tried rather desperately to identify practical ways in which the public can express themselves, and this, Commissioner, is perhaps the main shortcoming of your proposal. You might find it useful to borrow from parliamentary proposals, such as the one aimed at setting up an open citizens' forum, the consultation mechanism that will be piloted in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee is not opposed in principle to a new interinstitutional instrument, but it does ask for careful study of the guarantees and obligations implicit in such an instrument. It stresses, moreover, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights already defines citizens' information rights and that our Parliament’s prerogatives must be respected come what may, particularly its right to address itself freely to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential to take account of the very specific rhythm of the European debate, which is entirely separate from the national agendas. In this respect, we wish to reiterate our desire to have an annual plenary debate on the subject here in Parliament. We are in favour of the use of new technologies, provided they do not create a digital divide between those who have access to modern technology and those who do not. We also believe there is a need for better stratification of partnerships between civil society, European political parties and journalists – without prejudice, of course, to the independence of the media. We will even go so far as to make the iconoclastic proposal that a local European administration network be established to bring Brussels closer to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">What my report leaves unsaid relates to the legal basis. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs did not wish to express its opinion on Article 308. By a very narrow margin, it voted against explicit reference to that article, but by another very slim margin – and our thanks are due here to Mr Duff – it decided against formally ruling out recourse to Article 308, if you still follow the reasoning. The debate on the legal basis therefore remains wide open, although from a personal and tactical point of view I unreservedly endorse the proposals made by your rapporteur, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, whose open-mindedness, conviviality and constructive approach I commend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it problematic – and we in the Committee have found this too – that the Commission, where its relations with the public are concerned, often lags behind what the Ombudsman actually wants to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s responses to the many requests made of it by members of the public or those running projects in the European Union are often unsympathetic or even brash, and that is quite simply not on. It is precisely those interested citizens who are responding to demands for the submission of proposals who are often on the receiving end of such unfriendly treatment that they lose interest in working any more on European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, is going to happen in the case of those members of the public who have other interests and are not committed in the first place? That is no way to get our message across to people, and I have to say that, if what we are trying to do is to get people more involved, then the Commission’s new communications strategy is not going to achieve that. We need people where they are, and that is where we have to communicate with them; it cannot be done from Brussels. The Commissioner means well; she really does want to communicate, but the problem is that the public have no desire whatever for what the Commissioner is serving up to them, since they take the line that the Commission is going to be all in favour of it anyway and that they do not have any faith in it. What you need, then, is elected citizens on their home patch; you need the Members of this House, of the German <span class="italic">Bundestag</span>, and of the regional parliaments, with whom you can talk about matters of European interest. We have the great problem, though, that they do see themselves as responsible. We must try to communicate more on the public's own terms, reinforcing the infopoints in cities and establishing more of them, for it is these infopoints in town halls that get the message across to the citizens. We must, of course, make use of the programmes that the European Union already has in the educational field; educational programmes like Comenius, Erasmus, and Leonardo make for the best communications strategy, so let us use them, and then we will find the citizens that we need in order to continue the European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still, however, a long way to go to the establishment a European communication system in which European affairs are part and parcel of the public domain at the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">What I said in committee I shall repeat here: I regret that the White Paper continues to overrate new technology and to underrate national television services. We know, and Eurobarometer surveys confirm, that the mainstream national channels remain the favourite information source of the EU population. It seems to me that we must act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the White Paper remains strangely silent on the subject of financial resources. As we all know, democracy, and hence communication, come at a price. As long as the Union's multiannual budget is lower than the budget of a European advertising agency, little effective progress can be made. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Herrero, of course, and to say to him that the debate on Article 308 is not closed and that Mrs Prets will return to the problem shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is a sad fact that the Commission only ever talks about communication policy when Europe is in crisis. It is only when things are going badly that the Commission feels the need to communicate. The question that must be put to the Commission concerns the actual content of its communications. People see the Commission as an ultraliberal body with no interest in protecting European citizens from the storm winds of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to our citizens, and to democracy, to provide a better explanation of what happens in Brussels. Most of Europe's citizens are unaware of the achievements that have been made possible by the policies and financial resources of the European Union. What is more, they are too often unaware that every decision in Brussels emanates from the will of the Member States. If electricity, gas, rail transport and now postal services have been liberalised, it is because the Member States wanted them to be liberalised. Without the will of the Member States, these things would not have been done.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that what we need is not so much a code of conduct for the European institutions on communication with the public as a code of conduct for the Commission to ensure that it pursues policies that are more in tune with people's concerns. Lastly, we need a general code of conduct to apply to the Member States so that they assume their responsibilities and put a stop, once and for all, to the practice of ascribing European successes to national policies and national failures to the Community. That would raise Europe's stock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU has a massive communications problem and a bad image. The worst thing that the public accuse us of is that we are over-bureaucratic, with laws that are too divorced from reality and that bring them no benefit. That is not, of course, true, but it is in that very area that we have to get the message across, and that we often fail to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest example of this was the EU’s safety regulations relating to hand luggage on aircraft. Listen to members of the public talking about this at an airport, and you will get some idea of just how worked up they get about this, but they see the villain as being Brussels rather than Osama bin Laden or some other terrorist figure. It is we who are blamed for their no longer being able to take even a bottle of water on board with them, and we who are mocked when we insist on 100 ml containers, even though such containers are available nowhere in the EU’s single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, since it was the Commission that drafted this secret legislation, I will ask them just what they did to improve the way in which this was communicated; did they distribute leaflets to every passenger, asking them for their forbearance? If they did, I heard nothing of it. Did they put all their trust in media reports? That is not enough; what you have to do is address the public directly, for you are interfering directly in their lives, and, since it is their freedoms that you are restricting by means of these security rules, you have to come up with some very good arguments in favour of them. That is what communication is about.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now spent two and a half years working at improving communications, but all that has emerged has been intellectual concepts – the very antithesis of efficient communication – so let us be more practical, more down-to-earth, and, instead of making communication into an abstract science, let us simply see it as what it is, namely a tool, rather like a fire extinguisher when something is burning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The workers, judging on the basis of their life experience, are starting to question the vision of the European Union. This was expressed with the huge abstentions at the last European elections, with the referenda and 'no' votes on the European Constitution in France and Holland, with the reactions to the euro and inflation and with the huge movements against privatisation (in education, health and welfare) and employment relations (in insurance and other matters), facts which prove that the credibility of the European Union is on the wane in the eyes of the people. Thus, slowly but surely, a trend is emerging towards more and more acute social and political clashes.</p>

Thus, the Commission, in its White Paper on a European communication policy, is enlisting all means, starting from its institutions, the Member States, the national parliaments, local authorities and the media and making use of education in new technologies and the Internet, to identify public opinion and grassroots concerns and dissatisfaction and is using the information to improve its propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">Its objective, through and from the peoples' money, such as the PRINCE programme, through what are supposedly information actions, is to improve its propaganda and to lobby for the adoption of the European Constitution, which militarises Europe and condemns the people to fewer rights and constant austerity and for tolerance and acceptance of its policy overall.</p>
<p class="contents">It concentrates its efforts on controlling the channelling of information from state broadcasting stations, national and regional newspapers and private channels, the overwhelming majority of which are in the hands of capital, the Internet and so forth, so as to formulate the exact content which will put a gloss on its European imperialist policy, making it attractive and persuasive in the eyes of the peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper basically develops a dynamic and active communication policy hypocritically on the pretext of freedom of expression and understanding of its policies which are applied. Thus it wants to conceal its unilateral political choices through reinforced social dialogue which will safeguard the necessary smooth operation of the European Union as a mechanism of capital and social consent to and/or complicity in its political choices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we currently call communication is, in fact, nothing more than common propaganda. The words and arguments put forward have not and will not strike a chord with the people, because what the people want is dialogue and not one-sided propaganda. As long as pre-packaged dogmatic solutions are thrust upon them, people will not feel that they are participants in the discussion and will shut themselves away and become entrenched in their convictions. If we truly want modern communication or, even better, a social dialogue, then we must first answer the question of whether we are ready to speak with the people. If that is the case, then we should begin with a debate on what the European Union should be. Should it be a federal state or a Europe of countries and nations working in close cooperation? If we want a dialogue, then we have to acknowledge the results of the constitutional referenda in France and Holland and not stubbornly return to the draft Constitution, which is already dead.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also stop arguing about whether it is Europe for the citizens or the citizens for Europe, and let us instead try to hold a great European debate on the direction in which we are heading. Let us also bring Europe closer to the citizens, not by means of propaganda, but through good solutions, clear legislation, simplified procedures, less red tape, citizen-friendly institutions and the opportunity of discussion between equal partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is yet another reaction to the French and Dutch public rejecting unequivocally both the draft Constitutional Treaty and further integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of accepting that ‘no’ means ‘no’, the political elite have deluded themselves that the French and Dutch people did not base their ‘no’ votes on sensible and educated grounds. Indeed, a Commission official is recently quoted as saying: ‘given the recent experience in France and the Netherlands concerning referendums, we would not advise anyone to organise one’. So asking people what they want is a no-no.</p>
<p class="contents">May I offer you some advice? You are in a hole of your own making. I suggest you stop digging. You should throw away the spade. Why? Very simply, because you are missing the point. It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project, because if the substance is rotten then it will fail. For communication to be successful you have to listen. Simply shouting louder will not do!</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions are being disingenuous to the people they purport to represent. The French and Dutch have scuppered the project, yet you go on as if this never happened. Let me assure you that if and when the British people are afforded the same opportunity, the results will be even more conclusive, and that no communication policy will change the growing realisation that, right across the Member States, the EU project is an expensive failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is assumed, apparently, that better communication policy is only possible if there is more Europe, hence the plea for the European Constitution and for pan-European political parties. It appears that not much has been learnt from the referendums in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I do admit that it is difficult to fill the public with enthusiasm by means of communications policy if the rest of policy is at odds with public opinion. I would refer, for example, to the policy on enlargement. Although the Commission and Council know only too well that the large majority of Europeans are opposed to the accession of a non-European country such as Turkey, they are not in the least concerned about that. We can communicate until we are blue in the face, but it will do nothing to change the yawning gulf between public opinion on the one hand and European institutions on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The report suggests that the Commission’s information bureaus cannot kindle public interest. This is putting it mildly. In Flanders, for example, the country’s largest party, the <span class="italic">Vlaams Belang</span>, has not had one single invitation to the debates on European issues that have been organised in the provinces. These were debates among like-minded people, because the only party that is critical of the enlargement policy and the Constitution was not allowed to take part. What is more, Commissioner Wallström has openly admitted to the Belgian Federal Parliament that this discrimination goes on. Consequently, in my country, so-called European communication is nothing but propaganda – propaganda that nobody takes serious and that carries no credibility whatsoever. It is, in other words, a waste of money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe has not yet formed a political centre able to attract and mobilise its citizens and to win their support in these changing times. The reasons for this are plain: the lack of any adequate institutional reform, the prevalence of the power of indirect representation in the Council over that of direct representation in Parliament, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and work done behind closed doors over genuine efforts to publicise and inform.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Eurobarometer reminds us, people see Europe’s institutions as a remote or even alien freedom. They have not even the vaguest idea about some of them. The street is a long way from the centres of power, and the political system does not respond to the social milieu. The truth is that European, transnational, cosmopolitan citizenship only exists when imposed for political reasons, precisely because it does not have the spontaneous vigour of our national citizenships. Therefore, we urgently need to grasp the strategic importance of the general mass media; we urgently need to include Europe as a subject on the curriculum in schools, universities and training centres; we urgently need to publicise our institutions in the media; we urgently need to take more seriously the work done by the Commission’s and Parliament’s information offices in the Member States; and it is essential not to shelve the constitutional project to recast Europe: without serious institutional reform and without an effective information policy, Europe will be a giant with leaden feet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, thought does have to be given to how to communicate this, and a number of practical proposals have been put on the table in the form of the White Paper, but, if the knowledge deficit is to be reduced, it will be necessary to develop and push forward high-quality public relations work at every level. Among other things, that will mean more infopoints, which will be able to give useful answers to members of the public wandering haphazardly through cities in search of some way of making contact. We need more media at the local, regional and national level, for it is often the case that reports in most of the media take a negative line.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, too, whether in Brussels or Strasbourg, speaks a different language to what the people are used to at home. It is the EU’s fault that this or that decision went the wrong way; there, too, there is a need for action, and that is why – just as the report demands – it is important that dialogue among the Council, the Commission, Parliament, and the public, be encouraged, for with it, perhaps, we might stand a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the significance of the programmes being underlined. Programmes such as Leonardo and Erasmus, for example, do much to promote communication, but we are reducing their funding rather than topping it up. Such things as active citizenship and town partnerships are important, and we need them; they are preferable to innumerable brochures, and yet it is here – in quite the wrong place – that cuts are being made.</p>

What an idea, for that matter, to have been so long in coming! As has already been said, this was surely the only good thing to have come out of the rejection of the Constitution in France and the Netherlands. It will have confronted European leaders with their huge responsibilities in terms of communication. Europe is not suffering from a democratic deficit – the charge is unfair – but from a lack of information, explanation and appropriate, interactive and comprehensible communication.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome this White Paper, I regret that it confines itself to a catalogue of questions and principles. The time to speak about forums, consultations, surveys and networks and to reflect on possible measures has passed – it is now time to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The three key points in this document, in my view, are points 23, 24 and 32. It is in the education system that the battle for European citizenship can be won. We experience this daily in our encounters with students. It is in higher education that real citizens of Europe are nurtured, thanks to Erasmus, through direct contact with our cultures and our differences, and it is with the traditional media, for I have no faith in the alternative media, that we must work to highlight the value of our everyday activities and reveal the benefits of our legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in conclusion, Mr President, that this is a huge challenge and that this debate is essential, because the real threat in Europe today is not scepticism but indifference, which we must combat, and our weapon is communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the Commission in upholding the importance of bringing the institutions closer to citizens, not least by means of an efficient communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I share the rapporteur’s view that defining a common line for all the institutions would reduce the scope for freedom of expression and also for adapting communications, as is necessary, to the various spheres of action and to future social and technological realities. In fact, a legal framework in this area would serve only to burden pointlessly a sector that thrives on creativity and spontaneity. Let us not forget that communication is a tool and not an end in itself: if we want to reconnect citizens with the institutions, we need to do everything in our power to draw close to them and to listen to the requests coming from the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to avoid pointless legislation; deal with policies and actions that have a positive practical impact on growth and development, revive the draft Constitution, increase efficiency, and, most of all, do away with this ridiculous and extremely expensive monthly commute. If we can do all this and are then able to communicate it, we will be closer to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since I am not an ethologist, I do not know whether this is really what happened, or whether other factors also came into play. It is an unquestionable fact, however, that the human being is the most communicative being on earth. In other words, advanced communication is a distinctive natural characteristic of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that not only we humans, but the institutions, organisations and groups we create also wish to communicate, something that does not pertain to the essence or nature of these institutions. A study of history leads us to conclude that in the past, the institutions responsible for organising and directing our lives did not always strive for high quality communication, but in fact often explicitly closed themselves off from it. The effort to achieve ever more perfect communication with society is a distinctive feature of democracy, and has been made possible by the 20th century revolution in telecommunications. Without radio, television and the Internet we would not even be able to talk about this question today.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the above, I affirm that the European Union is one of the most open and communicative organisations that we have ever experienced in Europe. Naturally, it is not perfect, far from it, but until now, it is the best. It could use fewer technical terms or abbreviations, its concepts could be clearer and more comprehensible, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">But all this would be worthless if the EU, as a communicator, lacked credibility. Without credibility, even a comprehensible message does not come across. And in this regard something else must be said: the greatest destroyers of the Union’s credibility are none other than the politicians and governments of its Member States. They are the ones in whose statements the EU is presented solely as the cause of difficulties, whereas the positive achievements of the EU are always mentioned as the attainments of the government in question. This White Paper, too, will be successful only if the Member States commit themselves to developing and supporting a new, common European communication policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Though I acknowledge the great efforts made by the Commission and this Parliament to close this gap, it is absolutely essential that the media be involved, as well as national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The general view is that the media in the Member States believe that what happens here is not newsworthy or is not generally of interest to the citizens. We should firstly therefore involve the media more directly, so that they can help us to communicate and bring the Community dimension closer to the citizens, without using any technical jargon. With that kind of cooperation, we would probably also be able to communicate the European Union’s current news at times of day when media audiences are largest.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we must facilitate the work of these professionals, and it is essential that we simplify the procedures and make them more transparent. There must be cooperation and joint work with the national parliaments, so that they can communicate issues of concern at national, regional and local level and thereby, in the normal course of things, generate feedback on issues including those relating to European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that we should continue to look to the Internet as one of the main providers of Community information. Nevertheless, the Internet only reaches a section of the public that already has an interest. We have another public, which only uses traditional media – television and radio – via their respective national, regional or local channels and stations.</p>

<p class="contents">In the short time available to me, I should like to mention the strategy used by a former President of this Parliament, Pat Cox, to communicate Europe. In a famous speech, he started by talking about the local impact on a small community in the south of Ireland that used European legislation to maintain its telephone service. Then he moved on to the global – or European – level, speaking about European values and issues such as Blue Flag beaches, the European health card and other benefits that accrue to European citizens. That is a good strategy – communicating the added value of Europe at the local, regional, European and global levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Look at this week and take two pieces of legislation we have passed. We passed an amendment to Aarhus, which already guarantees public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. We have added GMOs to that.

This is the cunning ploy to try to bridge the gap between the Union and its citizens, instead of ceasing to impose abstract ideas and harassment through regulations and directives.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree entirely with the rapporteur: drawing up codes of conduct to be observed by all the European Institutions reduces the scope for independent opinions even further. This is even more true for Parliament, where the already extremely restricted scope for freedom – simply look, for example, at the way in which the President is elected, or the way in which speaking time is reduced for non-attached Members and their right to influence the legislative process is violated – would be further reduced by a code defining communication procedures. It is time to stop wasting money on ridiculous propaganda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Paragraph 10 of Mr Herrero’s report urges the Commission to examine the possibility of launching a European information and communication programme, in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as Vice-President responsible for information and communication in this Parliament, I have followed this debate very closely and I must point out that the interinstitutional group has expressed its support for the creation of a legal basis and that all of the institutions have also done so, as Mr Herrero has said. My conclusion is that it is worth trying.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the reservations that this proposal has generated, all concerning a loss of control by this Parliament, which is strange, ladies and gentlemen, since it is difficult to lose something that you do not have.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things that we must bear in mind, though. Firstly, the report makes it clear that, if the Commission presents a proposal, Parliament must participate fully in the drawing up of its content; secondly, Parliament has the powerful tool of budgetary control; and, thirdly, there is the interinstitutional group on communication, the mandate of which is to establish the basic guidelines for the communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must have courage and create a communication strategy that is capable of presenting, explaining and defending Europe through reason, but also with enthusiasm, passion and emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express my full support for the report by Mr Herrero and his proposal to create a programme on the basis of Article 308 of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the White Paper on a new communication policy, we have tried, first of all, to analyse the problem with previous communication policies and see exactly what we have to do to ensure that we democratically safeguard citizens’ rights to information and ensure they have a say in decision-making in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We established five areas of action. We need to define common principles, such as freedom of expression, diversity, inclusion, participation. We need to empower citizens. We need to involve them in different ways, from civic education, giving them a basic knowledge of what goes on, to engaging with civil society. We cannot ignore the new media and new technologies. If we think that it is enough to publish an article in <span class="italic">The Financial Times </span>to communicate with citizens, I am sorry, this is 2006. The debate is also shaped elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The real divide, as someone said at one of our stakeholder conferences, is between the decision-makers and those who use the internet.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the campaign in France, most of the websites on the Constitution were ‘no’ websites. Where were those who wanted to argue for a ‘yes’ vote? They did not use the internet enough. We have to understand and embrace what is going on in the new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth chapter is understanding public opinion. We have to be more professional in monitoring and linking up to public opinion. As many of you have said, we have to do the job together. All the institutions have to take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, some have accused us of issuing propaganda as soon as we do anything and others seem to think that it is enough to increase the number of Europe Direct information points in Europe. That will not do. We have to have a serious communication policy as a tool for democracy, a tool for citizens. They have a right to better understanding. They have a right to participate in a public sphere where we have a truly European political culture and truly pan-European media, reflecting the debate that is going on and helping us to understand and follow it. We also need to establish meeting places for citizens where they can participate.</p>
<p class="contents">You say we already have democracy in Europe. Well, we have a participatory deficit. The majority of citizens still say they know very little or do not know enough about the European Union and its institutions, they are not able to follow what is being done in the European Parliament or the Commission. Can we simply say that we do not care and continue with business as usual? We have to change the way we communicate with citizens and it is their right to engage with us.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to work on all the things that you have mentioned. We have steadily increased the Europe Direct centres. We now have 400 and for the first time we have established them in the UK as well. We will increase this number next year, with 30 new centres, and we will continue our obligation to inform citizens, but that is still not enough. This is not just about information, it is about communication. We have to make it a two-way process.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of our citizens get most of their information from radio and television, so we have to make sure that we help radio and television at all levels to report to citizens on what goes on. That is also part of our policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We will review Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, because access to information is absolutely crucial. Transparency, openness and access to information are central to a new communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we discuss the content of policies: that is at the core of everything we do. A communication policy cannot replace good content or good policymaking. That is why we engage in Plan D activities, where we invite citizens to participate in the political debate about the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We take seriously the proposals for practical measures such as Agora, which are extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have analysed the problems with the lack of a real communication policy. We have identified the five areas of action. We want a serious reaction from the European Parliament. Are these the right areas? If you have other proposals, we would be more than happy to work out very practical ideas, so that we can come back to ask for the necessary budgetary resources. We will combine that with reforming the way we work internally, in order to become more professional, more open, more transparent and more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for this debate and I hope that we shall continue to discuss these very important principles in trying to establish a communication policy that is right for the European Union and all its institutions.</p>

In light of this, we should welcome the Commission’s White Paper and its intention to improve communication between the Union and its citizens. The creation of a European public sphere composed of citizens who are well informed beyond their own national borders must undoubtedly be the objective of an effective European communications policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we must make significant improvements in the information we provide about the functioning and objectives of the European institutions, and on the other hand, we must be capable of listening to the citizens of the Member States and of making them active participants in shaping European policy. It is at the local, regional and national levels that we most effectively reach those citizens, and therefore we can make our provision of information more effective only by strengthening the communication and making the flow of information more effective between these levels and the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough merely to create adequate, two-way channels of communication, but the message itself must be made clearer and more understandable. Therefore, we must stop using a technical EU jargon that is often difficult even for an expert audience to understand.

<p class="contents">I do not think that the European common position on the longest-running conflict in the Middle East can continue to be the old policy of ‘two peoples, two states’. As the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations has pointed out, every civilian victim of the attacks by Israeli forces is a tragic error, experienced as such by Israeli democratic society, while every Israeli killed by the rockets and suicide bombers of Hamas or Hezbollah is hailed as a triumph over Israel, which is looked upon as a tumour to be eradicated from the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, Mr President, the viable and urgent European alternative for building peace between Israel and the Palestinians (and in the Middle East) is this: two peoples, two democracies. This is because only by proposing democratic reforms and the anti-nationalist European federalist model to the Mediterranean as a whole will it be possible to eradicate the structural causes of the Middle East conflict, causes which are very similar to those of all the wars which have devastated our continent, until the decision is made to renounce national sovereignty as an absolute value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That requirement, by the way, is not even mentioned here. Furthermore, I will not be associated with a resolution that seems to conclude that the United States is the reason why the conflict is still going on, and which rather unsubtly threatens to call the association agreement with Israel into question just as an association agreement with Syria is about to be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The sincere solidarity shown towards the victims and the refusal to accept that the attack on Beit Hanun should go unpunished cannot make me forget the need for balance or make me support a resolution that is disproportionate and counter-productive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not in any way to minimise the tragedy of Beit Hanoun, where misdirected Israeli artillery fire claimed 19 Palestinian lives. The mistake had tragic consequences, and it is right that we should condemn it.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy, however, does not entitle us to adopt a resolution that is the most unbalanced I have seen in my seven years in this Parliament. I cannot possibly enumerate all the partisan and contentious points in the text of this draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, it is a one-sided indictment of Israel. Paragraph 4 just about manages a reference to the country's inalienable right to security. The Qassam rockets that rain down daily on Israeli towns, on the other hand, do not merit a single mention. No more than three words are devoted to Gilad Shalit, who has now been in the hands of kidnappers for three months. This brief reference, moreover, is hidden away at the very end of paragraph 19, with no mention of his comrades who have been kidnapped in Lebanon. Some comments made during the debate, indeed, were despicable, such as the reference to an Israeli society 'hypnotised by rudeness and racism', or the talk of Palestinian deaths counting less than Israeli deaths. It seems that anything goes nowadays, and the boundary between anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic rhetoric is overstepped without anyone batting an eyelid. This is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The establishment of a standing naval force in the Mediterranean is one of the most preposterous ideas put forward. What is more, the majority of the committee advocates the creation of a separate budget heading for military operations, and attempts are also being made to revive the dead draft Constitution.

We have also adopted a position on the amendment calling for a coastguard under the aegis of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The development described in the report is very disturbing and should be a wake-up call, even for the most inveterate advocates of an EU state. In view of the insecure situation with which we are faced nowadays, as a result of the numerous conflicts that are going on around the world, we should instead be asking ourselves whether the establishment of an EU army is the right way to address these problems. Whether or not a nation state is to send in troops is something that must always be decided by the national parliaments, and never by a United States of Europe formed from the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">Today the United States devotes 3.5% of its GDP to defence, compared with the one per cent spent by the 25 Member States of the European Union. European harmonisation of defence equipment is certainly necessary, but do not let us dissolve our armed forces into a Eurocorps, in which orders would be given in 21 languages and which, via NATO, would be under US command. Let us rather strengthen the defence of each of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Only independent nations, conscious of their identity, will make that effort. To that end, the soulless and borderless Europe of Brussels must first be replaced by a Europe of sovereign nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Security is one of the most important issues for European citizens, particularly as regards the risk of threats on European soil, and on that subject the rapporteur has sought to be realistic and to understand the immediacy and nature of the threats and the real danger they pose. On the other hand, he has been ambitious in wanting to take a global approach, not just in the military field but also in the areas of technology, information and intelligence. We too have to be ambitious as regards the need to promote peace and economic development in third countries, insofar as that is essential for our own security and for a better world, which is a goal that we should be pursuing with just as much commitment.</p>

The June List is a committed opponent of common civil and criminal legislation at the EU level. The consequences if this proposal were adopted would include Swedish citizens losing their unconditional right to divorce (allowing for the rule on a six-month period of reflection).</p>
<p class="contents">One example of this is as follows. A married couple with Swedish citizenship take up residence in Malta. One of the spouses then moves back to Sweden and petitions a Swedish court for divorce. Under current Swedish legislation, that spouse would get a divorce under Swedish law. Under this proposal, however, it would instead be Maltese law that applied. This could mean that it would simply not be possible to get a divorce, as divorce is prohibited not only in Malta but in a number of other European countries. This would therefore mean that Swedish citizens would miss out both on maintenance for their children and on the right to half of the assets owned jointly with their spouses. In the June List’s opinion, this is entirely unacceptable. Legislation in this area is an expression of national, religious and social values. The EU must not be allowed to trample all over these values. As usual, we are discovering that subsidiarity and pluralism only exist in grand speeches, while the reality is a ruthless drive towards harmonisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, the value of each of these women lies in what she thinks, does, supports and represents. I therefore do not consider it reasonable simply to applaud the election of any woman, whoever she might be. Similarly, I do not think the desired effect can be achieved by means of quotas and imposing equal representation. Balance must be an outcome, not a gesture.

<p class="contents">In order to deal with the growth in this form of trafficking and with its increasingly international character, this report proposes a series of integrated measures to be taken at European level, which I feel are equal to the challenges associated with this scourge. Above all, it highlights the EU’s desire to follow an approach focused on human rights and on the victims, which I feel is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons and because the fight to uphold human dignity deserves our full support, I voted in favour of this text proposing the adoption of a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on fighting trafficking in human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Who are the real culprits, though? Without doubt, they are the smugglers, the drug traffickers, the pimps and other oppressors who take advantage of a European territory that has no internal borders and that is wide open to migratory flows. Yet, they are also the national and European leaders, who are taking no serious action to combat illegal entries, mass immigration, sham marriages – or, worse still, are implementing an overtly 'pro-immigration' policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Punishing the smugglers more severely, dismantling the criminal rings, and paving the way for further cooperation among States are undoubtedly objectives that must be attained. The placebo effect will not last long, however, because the real difficulty – the lack of controls at the European Union’s internal borders – remains. If we do not challenge the free movement of non-EU nationals, that veritable dogma spouted by Brussels, then illegal immigration will continue irresistibly to develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ever since Europe took it upon itself, on behalf of the Member States, to implement ‘an area of freedom, security and justice’, the criminal gangs, the pimps and the organised smuggling rings have made profits such as they have never made before. These networks are multiplying and prospering by exploiting more and more human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies, the Commission and Parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among States and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans. What is the use in doing that? It is high time we tackled the real causes of human trafficking and illegal immigration: the lack of secure, protected borders in Europe.

In this case, desperation makes the victims pay to be trafficked, and the authorities, often with the best of humanitarian intentions, may adopt policies that encourage trafficking and help the traffickers do business.</p>

That means being strict with those who provide work, strict with those who arrive, strict with those who stay and, above all, strict and rigorous in enforcing the law.

<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should unhesitatingly recognise the benefits of legal immigration and, since the lack of a strong hand in fighting illegal immigration merely encourages the networks that traffic human beings, we have to stand firm in upholding legality. It is not enough, however, to focus on immigration laws.

The EU has to promote political reform that stimulates economic development, security, international order and hope. That is the substance. As for communication, if the substance is good, it is an art, but it is only part of the story, and not the most important part at that.

It so happens that we are debating matters related to the Committee on Petitions for the second time today. This morning, our committee presented its report on the European Ombudsman's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that, although we have been waiting for a long time to discuss these two items, they have both been raised on the same day. It is with great satisfaction that, since we are describing the Committee on Petitions as a body that is intended to bring the European Union institutions closer to the citizens, we can today discuss a very important petition. I am also very pleased that some of the authors of the petition are here in the Chamber, and are sitting in the gallery. I am pleased to welcome Mr Afxentiou and Mr Christofidis who, as I have mentioned, are two of the authors of the petition and are listening to the debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the decision to table an oral question was taken in our committee at its meeting on 14 July 2005. The authors of the petition, including those who are here today, were also present at that meeting. They represent an organisation which is very important in Cyprus, and is called the <span class="italic">Famagusta Refugees Movement</span>. This movement was created in 1976 by the displaced inhabitants of Famagusta. Unfortunately, the European Parliament deferred the discussion a number of times. This resulted in significant delays to the staging of today’s debate. In the meantime, the whole problem has taken on even greater urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The authors of the petition stressed that 30 years have passed since Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army and the district of the town known as Varosha was closed off. When presenting their problems and their petition during our committee meeting, the authors of the petition pointed out that Varosha, which has become a complete ghost town, is causing a great rift between the displaced inhabitants and their descendants. It is an obstacle to the general economic revitalisation of the town and is doing nothing to promote better understanding between the communities in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The authors of the petition propose in particular that Varosha should be returned to its original inhabitants, under regulations to be adopted by the international community, and in particular by the European Union. The authors of the petition declare their support for attempts to help Turkish Cypriots who, from a legal and social point of view, form an integral part of Cyprus. They also express concerns regarding the regulations which have been implemented, and which favour the Turkish Cypriot community. Their concerns relate to the fact that these measures are causing isolation and disassociation from the underlying strategy which aims to reunite Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The authors of the petition stressed that, although this objective is contained in the explanatory statement in the Council regulation, which aims to create a financial aid instrument to foster the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, this package intends to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by supporting economic and social development, focussing particularly on economic integration.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been no consistent policy to achieve these aims. For their part, the authors of the petition propose, first and foremost, measures to facilitate the promotion of trade and tourism, which could increase the prosperity of the community and improve its financial situation, as well as making full use of the potential of the port of Famagusta, which would then result in the regeneration of the whole surrounding region.</p>
<p class="contents">The authors of the petition also proposed that part of the European Union funding earmarked for providing support to Turkish Cypriots should be paid into a special fund managed by a non-governmental organisation, in which both communities would be equal stakeholders, under the auspices of the European Union and the supervision of the European Commission. They also proposed that these funds should be earmarked for renovating, modernising and making use of the port of Famagusta.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions has, on behalf of the authors, addressed a question to the European Commission asking what instruments the Commission intends to use to ensure that the issues raised by the authors of the petition are resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 February 2006, the General Affairs Council decided to call on the Commission to undertake further efforts in the field of direct trade for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot communities, on the basis of negotiations which took place during the Luxembourg presidency, when the matter of the closed area of Varosha and the port was raised, together with matters relating to free trade. At the same time, it was also said that this part of Famagusta, Varosha, is not currently being used. It is an incredibly painful situation for the displaced inhabitants and their descendants. It also makes the economic regeneration of the town difficult and it does nothing to build trust between the Cypriot communities. What action, then, does the Commission intend to take in connection with the above-mentioned decision, to ensure that the closed area of Famagusta can be returned to its rightful inhabitants?.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this House has, on numerous occasions, debated issues in this House related to Cyprus, Turkey and the problems caused by the Turkish aggression against Cyprus. This petition, and the oral question resulting from it, addresses this very problem, which is a fundamental issue for that part of Europe and has consequences for the whole of the European Union. That is why I would be very grateful not only for an answer on this issue, but also to see the proposals put forward by various European bodies, as well as the demands of the authors of the petition, being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter is important, as the solution will, for Turkish, Greek and Cypriot society at large, serve to indicate how effectively the European bodies can resolve problems related to the hopes of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I would very much like to request a response and I hope that this response will satisfy the authors of the petitions, as well as the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personal friends I have known for a long time are refugees from Varosha and, therefore, I know the importance of the issue not only because of my portfolio but also because of my personal contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations has the responsibility and competences to pursue a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue. The Commission supports the United Nations in these efforts and encourages the parties concerned to resume talks on such a settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">The return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants is one of the key elements in the UN-led process. If agreed by the parties, the return of Varosha will have to take place under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annan Plan foresaw an early return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants. However, the plan, supported by the United Nations and the European Union, fell in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The return of Varosha is a separate issue from the introduction of direct trade between the Turkish Cypriot Community and the rest of the European Union. Direct trade is a matter of EU competence. The Commission proposed a draft regulation to this effect in July 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Successive EU presidencies, in seeking to establish a consensus in the Council on the direct trade regulation, have investigated possible solutions, but without success so far. The Finnish Presidency is making substantial diplomatic efforts to unblock the current stalemate and the Commission fully supports the Presidency in its efforts. The Finnish formula would create a genuine win-win situation for both communities and all parties concerned. It would be a major confidence-building measure towards a comprehensive settlement, thus meaning also a prospect of the return of Varosha. Creating a win-win situation has been the essence of European integration since the times of Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer, who united France and Germany just five years after the most bitter and devastating war on earth was fought on their soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past 42 years there has been enough talk of ‘red lines’ and ‘blackmail’ in the eastern Mediterranean. That is pre-modern talk in today’s post-modern Europe. It is high time to replace red lines with bridge-building and win-win thinking, because that is what the European Union is all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was precisely the basis on which the Famagusta refugee movement presented its petition to the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">For 32 years now, over 30 000 people have dreamt day and night about going back to their homes. Thirty-two years is too long. The beautiful city of Famagusta is still uninhabited. It is a ghost town. Turkey cynically insists on keeping it as a bargaining tool. Naturally, the question the inhabitants of Famagusta are asking is what the international community is doing, and what the European Union is doing, to help them go back to their homes. The Commissioner has said that everybody is trying. However, the issue is very simple. There is an empty city to be given to its lawful inhabitants. There are other bargaining tools for Turkey to use.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is not being sent the right message on what should be done. The deliberations on Famagusta are the first big step towards a proper solution to the Cyprus problem based on United Nations resolutions and European values. Turkey has to take that step now, in the interests of justice, in the interests of Turkey and in the interests of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as Mr Libicki has said.</p>
<p class="contents">The desperate appeal coming from those refugees from Famagusta who are still alive is: ‘Help us to go back home’. Let us help them, Commissioner. Now is the time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, however, we are debating efforts by certain people who belong to the large European family to be able to regain exactly what we consider to be reasonable in our everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The movement of refugees from Famagusta consists of displaced citizens from what has been a ghost town for 32 years. These people have, of course, managed to rebuild their lives in Cyprus. Just think, however, what it means to know that your first home or your parents' home lies abandoned and inaccessible a few kilometres away, for reasons for which you are not to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">The return of the town of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants in the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot community will have numerous economic and social benefits. Famagusta was a popular tourist destination. Its reconstruction can restore it to its former glory, as well as creating huge potential for trade, by making use of its port, which can be reopened as requested, using the latest technologies in order to make the best possible use of it. If the town is restored to its residents in a way which safeguards the strengthening of ties between the two communities, with guarantees from the international community and, of course, the European Union during the period of reconstruction and development, reasonable ties will develop between the two communities. If an environment of security, certainty and trust is created for economic development and cooperation, as cooperation in employment and the economy develops, social ties will develop alongside it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what is needed is for the town to develop its own momentum, a momentum which will function as an example and precursor. I wonder, given that the request comes from the residents of the town themselves and knowing the good ties between people on both sides, if we have the right to refuse, if we have the right not to help. Nonetheless, this opportunity should not become a chance for us to blow up progress efforts in Cyprus. We shall all have our responsibilities, responsibilities towards the people as well as responsibilities towards posterity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marios Matsakis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span><span class="bold">. –</span> Mr President, the taking of hostages by terrorists and their subsequent holding to ransom has not been an uncommon occurrence in recent years. It is a despicable act of satanic criminal perversion, and is widely and universally condemned by all those with even the slightest degree of common sense. Equally, the taking of a city as hostage by a country which has invaded another and then uses that city to extract political gains by blackmail is a case of psychopathic barbarism of immense magnitude and unintelligible reasoning. This is what has happened in the case of Famagusta.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until 1974, Famagusta was a thriving city full of life and vigour, with a rich history going back thousands of years, surrounded by blossoming citrus fruit orchards, lying on a golden sandy coast. It was a city of enviable beauty. Famagusta was widely regarded by many as the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean. Its peace-loving inhabitants went about their daily lives, working hard to achieve progress and prosperity. But in the summer of 1974, all their dreams were shattered.</p>
<p class="contents">After repeated severe and catastrophic air bombardments, the city was overrun by droves of Turkish soldiers, tanks and armoured vehicles, spreading death and destruction in their path. In horror, the inhabitants fled, trying desperately to save the lives of their loved ones and carrying with them the bare essentials needed to survive. Most of them found refuge on an area of high ground a few kilometres to the south of the city, where they lived in makeshift refugee camps, and from where they watched their homes being looted by Turkish soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from furniture and other household effects, the invaders took away doors, windows, pipes, roof tiles and everything else they could lay their hands on. Then they fenced off the whole city, declared it a military zone and put guards around it. This state of affairs continues today, 33 years later. Whenever an inhabitant, driven by homesick desperation, has tried to approach his fenced city, he has been shot dead on the spot or arrested by Turkish soldiers and tried in Turkish military courts on grounds of entering a high security military area.</p>
<p class="contents">The ghost city of Famagusta has many times been the focus of attention in various UN resolutions, and in between the ‘ifs’ and ‘whens’ and ‘hows’ of hazy diplomatic language, the people of Famagusta have tried to believe time and time again that they will return to their homes. But this has all been an illusion, because in the real world of political diplomacy it is almost always the strong who have their way. In the case of Cyprus, Turkey was, and still is, by far the strongest.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the refugees from Famagusta were about to become totally disillusioned with the UNs and Security Councils of this world, new hope suddenly emerged in the form of Cyprus’ accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Men, women and children were suddenly uttering words like ‘the European <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>’ and ‘the principles and values upon which the EU is founded’. Many were even convinced that after accession the EU would force Turkey to return Famagusta to its rightful occupants. How simple-minded they were. Little did they realise that the EU mainly cares about trading in the vast Turkish market and not about the old-fashioned principles of justice and freedom. Little did they know that the EU mainly views Turkey as being of close to almighty importance in counteracting the threat of Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, dear colleagues, we find ourselves today talking, talking and talking about the right of Famagustians to go home. Most probably, if Turkey has its way, we shall continue talking about it for a long time to come, while the great EU goes on being proud of its principles and values, and almost everybody will be happy – especially the Turkish Government – apart from the people of Famagusta.</p>
<p class="contents">We will gradually come to terms with their grief at having to watch their city, the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean, slowly die away under the careful eye of the UN, the Security Council, and now the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The long-standing decoupling of the return of the town from the overall settlement is one element I want to comment on. The second element is that the Commission, in its last progress report on Turkey, emphasised that the application of the protocol is per se a legal obligation which cannot be linked to the status of the Turkish-Cypriot community. Consequently, Turkey is wrong to link the matter of the honouring of its commitments to the lifting of the so-called isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots which, insofar as it exists, is due solely and exclusively to the Turkish occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">Circles in the European Union are likewise wrong to accept this link. However, if this link is made, the proposal by the Cypriot Government on joint use of the port of Famagusta, under the aegis of the United Nations and with supervision by the European Commission, combined with the return of the lawful inhabitants of the town, may be the turning point which will help overcome the entirely unwelcome impasse that has developed. Turkey will be satisfied in its demand for the so-called isolation of Turkish-Cypriots to be lifted. The Turkish Cypriots, even though they have absolutely nothing to lose by returning the town which has been deserted for 32 years to its lawful inhabitants, are safeguarding the right to engage in export trade via the port. Likewise, all the lawful inhabitants will move back to their town while, at the same time, the Turkish ports and airports will open to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes.

It has been described as a ghost town; it is desolate, isolated and empty. Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus. In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Famagusta and since then the city has been fenced off. At the moment it is unused and is guarded by Turkish troops. Nobody lives there. Anybody who attempts to enter is shot on the spot or tried in military courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Famagusta only enjoyed independence for 14 years. During that time, it was of indispensable benefit to the Cypriot economy. It had a population of 60 000 and 15 000 daily commuters. It hosted a bustling port. Despite housing only 7% of the population of Cyprus, it accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus. Despite these figures and the obvious benefit to Cyprus, the town has remained desolate. This is clearly not a tolerable situation for Cyprus or the people. Obviously something must be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it incredible that the EU is not demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Famagusta to its inhabitants who are, incidentally, EU citizens. Instead we have this bizarre situation where the EU and many EU governments try to accommodate every one of Turkey’s obscene demands and wishes. We all know that Turkey desires to join the EU. We know what a powerful country it is. However, we must ask ourselves whether Turkey is ready to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is doing its accession cause no good. When I first came to this House, I voted to open talks with Turkey. I abstained in the latest vote. Will I have to vote against Turkish accession or will I feel a little goodwill on the part of Turkey some time soon?</p>
<p class="contents">I can see no good in this situation. Returning Famagusta would be an excellent opportunity for Turkey to show not only the original inhabitants of Famagusta but also the EU and the rest of the world that it is a peace-loving and peace-supporting nation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now beginning to see a promising deal emerging under the Finnish Presidency of the EU, under which the Turkish-occupied north of the island can be reopened to direct trade through the port of Famagusta, under strict EU monitoring. This would be in exchange for the return by Turkey of the fenced-off area of Varosha to its original Greek Cypriot residents, under UN control. Fortunately, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants can return with minimal disruption, as no one needs to be relocated because the depopulated Varosha area was sealed off in 1974 and is under the direct control of the Turkish military.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference to the resettlement of Varosha was included in the 1979 Kyprianou-Denktas high-level agreement. It was agreed all that time ago that this would be implemented without awaiting the outcome of the discussion on other aspects of the Cyprus problem, or be used as a bargaining chip in dealing with other Cypriot issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly its return cannot be linked to the issue of Turkey implementing its firm commitment as an EU candidate state to open its ports to all Cypriot vessels, as agreed by Turkey under the Ankara Protocol on enlargement of the customs union, which must be extended to all EU Member States. These include the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey ludicrously refuses to recognise legally, even though Cyprus is a full EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Line also needs to be carefully monitored if direct trade from the north is resumed, with regard to potential increases in illegal immigration and people-trafficking, particularly of women from Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus cannot be allowed to carry on as a sanctuary to escaped criminals, including notable UK fugitives from justice such as Mr Asil Nadir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people who once lived there can, from a distance, see their houses behind the fence; the desire to go back to them has never left them, and I believe they have a right to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, Commissioner, that we in this House and you in the Commission cannot sort out the Cyprus problem on our own. If things had gone the way this House, or the Commission, had wanted, a solution based on the Annan plan would be in place today, but, disappointed though we are by the Greek Cypriots’ overwhelming ‘no’, we do have to respect it, and – let me make this quite plain – we actually have done so. We nevertheless hope for a solution soon.</p>
<p class="contents">What really could create trust and encourage further positive developments would be for Varosha to be returned to its original inhabitants and governed by representatives of both communities, and for Cypriots of both ethnicities to live together in Famagusta.</p>
<p class="contents">You have indicated, Commissioner, that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is currently endeavouring to facilitate the direct trade between the EU and Northern Cyprus that has been promised for over two years.

He said at the time, that, as no city had suffered as much from human stupidity as Strasbourg, it was ideally suited to being the place where human stupidity was to be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish we could soon be in a position to say something similar about Famagusta, which is symbolic of a brutal expulsion that is both contrary to international law and a violation of human rights, as brutal as it is senseless; yet it could, without difficulty, and by one simple act of goodwill, be made a symbol of the downfall of nationalism and expulsion, one whose impact would be felt a long distance away from Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall how, on one occasion when I was in Northern Cyprus, I had a Turkish Cypriot driver who spoke good Greek, and said: ‘I have deep sympathy with my Greek-speaking fellow-Cypriots, and it is not the Greek Cypriots that are our problem, but the Turkish army and the settlers that have been brought into the country artificially.’ It is these people who have a vested interest in keeping this dispute alive. That is what we should do something about. We should ensure that both ethnic groups can be reconciled and that the expellees can return to their original homes in Famagusta; that would send out a message to the whole of the Mediterranean, to Europe and the world as a whole, affirming that people belonging to different ethnic groups can live together in peace under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyprus could, in this respect, become an example for many, many other troublespots, and so I am grateful to the organisers of this petition for raising this issue. We owe it to them to stand alongside them in every way and secure them that to which they are entitled and for which they have been waiting for so long, namely that Famagusta should once more become the flourishing place of commerce and culture that it has been throughout its history – a history filled with proud traditions which, let it be hoped, may be re-established in the future.</p>

Neither should we forget about the fact that 111 people are still in detention following the mass arrest of opposition supporters during demonstrations held in June and November 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission and to the Council to do everything in their power to initiate a broad dialogue in Ethiopia, which would involve the participation of the political parties, civil society organisation and the authorities, to agree on a permanent solution to the current political crisis. We have to do all we can to make sure that the enduring principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law are re-established in that country. In order for this to happen, the Ethiopian authorities must show the world that they are willing to resolve the current crisis. The immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners would certainly constitute such a gesture of goodwill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it seems that our advisory words of wisdom and strong condemnation have been falling on deaf ears as far as the Ethiopian Government is concerned. However, who can blame it for behaving in such an arbitrary and totally unacceptable manner towards this Parliament when the Commission, for reasons best known to itself, invited Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to address the European Development Days specifically on governance issues? That inevitably sent out the wrong signal with regard to the EU’s policy on respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance. Perhaps the Commissioner might be kind enough to explain to us today what the logic was behind that invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">We all understand the difficulties Ethiopia has been facing in its troubled post-colonial history and realise that some blame lies clearly and squarely with the ex-colonisers. We all want to help the Ethiopian people to achieve an acceptable standard of living, free of the evils of internal fighting and regional conflict. However, the governing regime in Addis Ababa must understand comprehensively and unequivocally that the highly-desired political stability will not be achieved through continuing arrests, harassment, arbitrary detention, humiliation and the intimidation of opposition politicians, civil society activists, students and other ordinary citizens. Such actions are, on the contrary, bound to lead to a deterioration of the already fragile political situation in Ethiopia, and the feared further worsening of the situation will become a certainty rather than a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge colleagues to support this motion for a resolution, and I wait with interest to hear the Commissioner’s comments on the issue of the invitation to Mr Meles Zenawi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ever since the conclusions of the EU election observation mission in 2005, the Member States’ governments in the Council and the Commission should have been working together to take action regarding Mr Meles Zenawi's regime. As Teshale Aberra, one of the judges who had to flee the country, said, the Meles Zenawi government is just as bad as, or even worse than, the Mengistu regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia receives financial aid from the European Union, and therefore the European Union must demand the immediate release of all political prisoners. It must also demand that an international inquiry into the 2005 massacres be set up and that those responsible for the massacres be brought to justice. The EU must adopt the appropriate measures provided for in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, of which Ethiopia is a member, as this Parliament demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Such measures include freezing the European assets of Mr Meles Zenawi and members of his government and denying them entry visas to Europe. All these measures must be designed so as to hit those who are primarily responsible, and not to hurt the Ethiopian people. Our governments and the Commission must stop justifying their tolerant attitude towards this anti-democratic regime that violates human rights, on the pretext that it is an ally in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe and the United States must stop deluding ourselves. Ethiopia’s intervention in Somalia on the pretext of fighting terrorism has only served to entrench the Islamic Courts in Mogadishu, and the disastrous consequences do not stop there: discredited and lacking in popular support, Mr Meles Zenawi’s regime has left Ethiopia itself, Africa’s second most populous country, wide open to infiltration by terrorists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are very concerned about the situation there. We have found a complete lack of willingness – particularly on the part of the government – to learn any real lessons from the results of the elections, or, on the other hand, from the findings of a commission of inquiry into the parliament that the government had itself set up.</p>
<p class="contents">We have urged the Prime Minister to take these findings from the commission of inquiry as the starting point for a nationwide dialogue. To that he gave no clear response; on the contrary, indeed, we have discovered that the members of this commission have been subject to duress and that some of them have fled abroad. If the report is published at all, it will no doubt appear in a polished-up and falsified form.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful to the President of the Commission for speaking to the prime minister in such very plain terms of the occasion of his visit, but it is unfortunate that the environment Commissioner should, by inviting Mr Meles to visit Brussels, undermine the Commission’s stance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it important that we should, now that we are equipping ourselves with a new instrument for democracy and human rights, ensure that it is an effective one and one that enables us to support democratic political forces. The new regulation must include a form of words to this effect, for how else are we to provide the opposition with legal counsel or help newly-elected parliamentarians who have no money to exercise their constitutional rights? It is for that reason that I call on not only the Commission, but also and in particular on the Member States to abandon their resistance to an effective instrument for democracy and human rights being drafted in these terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Ethiopia’s case that dialogue will be a critical one, both in the sense of it being important and in the sense of our being critical of the Ethiopian Government’s current practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The omens are not good. Some 193 citizens were killed in the riots in June and November 2005. The report on that inquiry remains unpublished, sanitised and unclear. Since that time a number of Ethiopians have been imprisoned, and recently two EU officials were expelled from the country. All this is not news to anyone involved in this debate, but things are stacking up and do not look good for Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">Dialogue will indeed be critical and, as Mr Matsakis says, paragraph 7 of this resolution expresses regret at the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister Zenawi to Brussels to tell us about good governance. This is an irony that would be funny were it not so tragic. However, let us be positive. The Commissioner will hopefully tell us today that this will give us the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Zenawi and tell him frankly of our concerns. I hope the Commissioner will confirm that this opportunity will not be missed when Mr Zenawi comes to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethiopia plays an important role in the African Union and an important role in development. We could work much better in cooperation with one another. However, that cooperation, as colleagues have mentioned, should not be taken for granted and must be based on mutual principles and, importantly, adherence to them.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not stick to our principles we can hardly expect others to, so I hope we can have a frank and open discussion with the Prime Minister when he comes to Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should point out that today, we are talking about a very specific country, a country whose history is older than the history of many, or even most, European countries, who consider their roots to lie in the times of the Old Testament rulers King David and the Queen of Sheba.</p>
<p class="contents">This country, which also adopted Christianity earlier than many, if not most, European countries, is a country that is also entirely unique on the African continent. It has maintained its sovereignty throughout its history, with the exception of a short period in the thirties, when it was conquered by a European state. Even then, it maintained its independence in legal terms. Even during that invasion, which was an attempt to impose colonial rule, Emperor Haile Selassie, the country’s honourable ruler, who was greatly respected throughout the world and in Ethiopia, represented his country when he was an expatriate and in exile.</p>
<p class="contents">In the seventies, Ethiopia was the victim of a communist plot, involving the Kremlin and Cuba. Since then, it has not managed to return to normality.

This event, to which the Prime Minister of Ethiopia has been invited as a guest, began on the same day as the Parliamentary session and will end tomorrow. The Ethiopian Prime Minister has even appeared as a speaker. The European Commission has decided that it would prefer to turn a deaf ear to the reports of persecution that are emerging from Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we in the European Union cannot pretend that we are dealing with a normal country. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. We are dealing with a country which is a political prison for many journalists, trade unionists and human rights advocates. We do not even know how large a prison it is, as the Ethiopian government systematically refuses to reveal how many political prisoners there are or how many people have been arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, members of yet another profession, namely teachers, were arrested. Clearly the attitude of the European Commission and the Council towards Ethiopia must depend on whether Ethiopia upholds human rights and, first and foremost, whether it agrees to release political prisoners or not. However, it should also be made clear that this is not only a matter that concerns the European Union. The African Union must also take action.

The EU, in line with the international donor community, has given priority to maintaining an open and structured dialogue with the Ethiopian Government as the most appropriate way towards improving the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following a visit to key political detainees, Commissioner Michel received commitments from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during a dialogue in February that they would get a short and fair trial. President Barroso met Prime Minister Zenawi in Addis Ababa last October to express the Commission’s concerns about the trial and the prisoners. President Barroso pointed out that he expected the trial to be speedy, fair and transparent. He also stressed that he did not consider a trial to be an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political differences. Instead, he suggested reconciliation and dialogue as the only way forward in building confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">When two members of the Commission delegation were arrested and expelled from Ethiopia and a local employee of the delegation was arrested, President Barroso, Commissioner Michel and EU Member States immediately expressed their deep concern at these events, which clearly breached the Vienna Convention. The Commission strongly refuted the accusation against the Commission delegation and its staff. The Commission headquarters expressed its support and solidarity with the delegation staff and we were satisfied that this immediate and strong reaction resulted in the release of the arrested local agent on bail.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some doubts as to the wisdom of inviting Prime Minister Zenawi to the European Development Days. The Commission believes that dialogue and further efforts have to be pursued to convey EU concerns to the Ethiopian Government and to obtain commitments on democratic reforms and good governance.

In the 1940s Bangladesh was divided into two sections on the basis of religion, which failed to ease an already complicated situation. The subsequent war of independence with Pakistan only served to exacerbate the extreme poverty, and not only in the provinces. </p>
<p class="contents">In the country’s constitution, there is a special mechanism for placing power into the hands of the incumbent government during the preparation of elections. It is known the world over that microloans have been a great success. Less well known is that this success has, in this strongly Islamic country, been due especially to the commitment of women. As in any vastly overcrowded and very poor country, there are huge problems with inadequate infrastructure and with religious and ethic intolerance. I believe that these problems can be reduced and that the secular tradition can prevail. </p>
<p class="contents">A difficult problem in any election, and not only in developing countries, is the question of who is eligible to vote. In Bangladesh the problem is exacerbated by the fact that a section of the population is illiterate. The next most important thing after factually correct electoral registers is for candidates to have the opportunity to present their manifestos. It is no wonder that the proposed text of the resolution also highlights this. I should like to emphasise at this point that I do not believe that the recognition or otherwise of journalists by any country in the world can serve as a yardstick of democratisation. In any event, freedom of the press is closely associated with the democratic competition of ideas and manifestos. This is something that must not under any circumstances be compromised in the run-up to elections. Similarly, it is the permanent responsibility of all governments to eliminate terrorist groups. </p>
<p class="contents">A more complex issue is how to define the word terrorist, and how to fight terrorism in a democratic society. At the last meeting of the group for cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, which I had the honour of chairing, those in attendance expressed the view that it is possible for genuinely democratic elections to take place in Bangladesh. </p>
<p class="contents">The observations contained in the motion for a resolution made their mark in the meeting I chaired, and I believe that sending a European Parliament observation mission will help towards the democratic running of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left supports the motion for a resolution before us, and I believe that we must support the process of democratisation in Bangladesh, including helping to make these elections as democratic as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last ‘Reporters without Borders’ report reveals hundreds of attacks on freedom of the press. This year alone, three journalists have been killed, at least 95 others have been attacked and dozens, if not hundreds, of correspondents have been forced to flee after being intimidated for writing articles that are deemed to be ‘un-Islamic’.</p>
<p class="contents">If it was my wish for Parliament urgently to voice its opinion on this situation today, it is because, right now, in Dhaka, Salah Choudhury is standing trial for sedition. This journalist, the editor of the Weekly Blitz, is a fervent supporter of moderate Islam, who advocates openness and dialogue between religions and recognition by his country of the State of Israel. For these reasons and for these reasons alone, he is in danger today of being sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the Commission to follow the developments in this trial so as to ensure that the rights of the defendant, together with the international conventions on freedom of the press, are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I have a few seconds left, I should like to declare my support for the interim government's efforts to ensure that the pre-election process also complies with international democratic standards: the establishment of an appropriate electoral register, a truly independent electoral commission and, I shall come back to it once again, the balance and freedom of the media during the election campaign, of course. It is quite clear that the country’s four private television channels have difficulty in putting forward a different point of view to that of the government if they want to keep their licences.</p>
<p class="contents">Two terrorist leaders have been arrested in Bangladesh; continued efforts must be made to disarm the Islamic militias that are trying to put pressure on the voters on the eve of the election. We expect the government to confirm its commitment in this regard, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a country which has made significant economic progress during the last few years. At the moment, its most famous citizen is Mohammad Junus, who received the Nobel Peace Prize this year for his contribution to the fight against poverty by means of a system of microcredits.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Bangladesh is not struggling just with poverty, but also with corruption and an increasingly antagonistic attitude displayed by followers of Islam. The creation of the caretaker government headed by President Iajuddin Ahmed was met with protests from Bangladeshi society. According to reports by external observers and the Awami League, the authorities illegally increased the voting lists for the upcoming elections by 13 million surnames. The caretaker government must guarantee free elections which comply with international standards. The independence of the electoral committee also needs to be guaranteed and the electoral roll simply needs to be credible.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Awami League and the other parties on the creation of a common economic programme, which is vital in order to improve the living conditions and civil liberties of the people of Bangladesh would undoubtedly be a basis for political stability in the country. Under the terms of key international human rights conventions, the interim government has to combat lawlessness, extra-judicial executions and torture, which are usually the work of the police or the security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the situation is as follows: last year three journalists were killed and nearly 100 people were victims of intimidation or sustained physical injuries. Attacks on staff of non-governmental organisations are increasing from day to day. Religious minorities, namely Hindus and Christians, are living in danger. Rape and human trafficking involving women and children are commonplace. The impression is that everything that has been achieved in terms of democracy in the country is disappearing as a result of the growing violence on the part of Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the European Commission should systematically monitor the human rights situation in Bangladesh. They should also monitor the situation as regards freedom of speech and freedom of the press. We hope that the planned European Union observation mission to Bangladesh, to supervise the forthcoming elections in January, will help to ensure that the election process is democratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The opposition charged Zia with filling the key posts in her interim government with sympathisers, accused the head of the electoral commission of being biased and asserted that there were 13 million invalid names in the electoral register. More violence broke out at the beginning of this week, with all transit routes to Dhaka by land or water being blockaded, journalists attacked and seriously wounded, 20 000 members of the security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets in street battles, all of which left seventeen people dead and thousands injured.</p>
<p class="contents">There are increasing attacks by Islamists on adherents of other religions, and I condemn, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the acts of bloody violence and the constant assaults by Islamic extremists on religious minorities such as Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus, and the suppression of press freedom, which other Members have already denounced.</p>
<p class="contents">Those in power – who belong to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party – and the Awami League opposition, must bury their personal animosities once and for all and embark upon purposeful dialogue. A date has been set for elections, and it must be kept to; the electoral commission must start preparing for them now, and that means, above all else, making sure that the electoral register is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions currently prevailing – which are tantamount to civil war – must be normalised as soon as possible, with the Islamists being disarmed. The citizens must be enabled to avail themselves of their right to vote without fear of reprisals in order that democracy may be given a chance.</p>

<p class="contents">It was very interesting, firstly, to see the reaction of the Bangladeshi ambassador, who had been nominated, the poor man, that very day and who was getting to grips with what Parliament was all about on that occasion: he saw the devastation that democracy and transparency can cause when they are applied! We did, indeed, learn many things that day, which was very useful because the representatives of your Commission who were present were not really keen, at the start of the morning, to go and ascertain what was taking place on the ground. Having heard what we all heard, they were well and truly obliged, at the end of the meeting, to acknowledge that intervention was needed, so serious is the situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go back over what was said by my fellow Members regarding the poverty, corruption, violence and torture – torture inflicted not only by the squadrons of the various militias, but also by the police. The figures in this regard are terrible: in 2005, 2 297 cases of torture were recorded as having been carried out by the police. I shall mention the case of the journalist, Mr Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, who is in danger of being sentenced to death on the sole grounds that he expressed his opinion freely: this is totally unbearable! I could also quote a figure that comes from your Commission, Commissioner: your own services estimate that more than 13 million invalid names have been added to the electoral register. How can elections be contemplated when it is already clear that there will be such a huge amount of fraud, so much organised fraud?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, over and above the vote in favour that the vast majority of us are, I hope, going to cast today, the Commission really must provide itself with all of the resources needed to send out signals on the ground aimed at making the government quickly move the goalposts, so as to bring it into line with the democratic standards that existed in this country a few years ago, and to thus put a stop to the institutional violence that is sadly degenerating into social violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For many years since its foundation in 1971, Bangladesh was the exception in the Islamic world as it pursued its independent course as a Bengali nation in a peaceful and democratic fashion. Regrettably, since 2001 there has been increasing Islamicisation of Bangladesh as Islamists have attempted to fill the vacuum left by corrupt warring secular parties. The NGO Task Force against Torture has documented over 500 cases of torture and intimidation by radical Islamists who have also murdered supporters of the Communist Party. Indeed, Hindus, Ahmadis, Christians, Chittagong Hill Tract tribal people and Buddhists have also been targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent civil unrest took to the streets with violent outbreaks as the Awami League opposition doubted the impartiality of the electoral commission, the integrity of the voters’ list or even the impartiality of the original caretaker prime ministerial nominee.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Bangladesh Cooperation Agreement of 2000 is based on respect for democratic principles pursuant to Article 1, and its breach can lead to the suspension of the agreement and with it the significant EU Generalised System of Tariff Preferences and EU foreign aid, which amounts to 70% of Bangladesh’s total foreign aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and all the major donors must now coordinate to keep up the pressure for reform and full respect for democracy, a free press and human rights for all of Bangladesh’s citizens prior to the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place next January. We must send short-term political observers from the European Parliament in substantial numbers. These elections are crucial and it is essential that the EU maintains a visible major presence throughout the Caretaker Government period, as otherwise some frustrated, power-hungry general might consider launching a military coup. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has received death threats and been assaulted, imprisoned, beaten and tortured. Mr Choudhury is now facing an unfair trial and has little chance of seeing justice. The presiding judge has commented in open court that Mr Choudhury has hurt the sentiments of Muslims. It is clear that the judge is hoping for a death sentence.</p>

<p class="contents">The country is at a critical juncture of its fragile democracy. Much is at stake with the forthcoming elections in this densely populated country. Regrettably, however, the institutional framework and the acrimonious relations between the two main political parties do not bode well for a peaceful and democratic electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last weeks and months, the Commission and the seven Member States with representations in Dhaka, as well as the wider international community, have been intensely engaged with the main party leaders and election stakeholders, urging all of them to agree on an electoral framework that achieves the trust of all parties. The EU regional Troika in February, local EU Presidency representatives and several high-level visits from the Commission and Member States have consistently emphasised the need for impartial guidance of the country by the Caretaker Government in the pre-electoral period, a neutral Election Commission, and a credible voter list.</p>
<p class="contents">As you might be aware, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has taken the political decision to deploy an EU Election Observation mission for these elections. Preparation for the deployment of EU observers, including internal procedures between the institutions for financing the mission, are currently under way. In her letter to the President, or Chief Adviser, she underlines the above issues as the key concerns of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The mission would be deployed around six weeks before election day, and it would remain in the country for some two to three weeks after that day, in order to follow the post-election period, particularly in the light of the unfortunate possibility of post-election violence, especially against minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament’s concerns over the widespread violence against journalists. The fact that the latest report by Reporters sans Frontières categorises Bangladesh as an extremely dangerous place for journalists unfortunately speaks for itself. The Commission has consistently condemned the intimidation and high level of impunity that apply to violent acts against journalists in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have failed in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan, and also in relation to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The US-led ‘war on terror’ has strengthened Iran’s power and influence in the Middle East, and until there is stability in the region, Iran’s influence will continue to grow, along with its efforts to stand up to pressure from the West. Furthermore, the more the West threatens Iran, the more it boosts radical forces in Iran. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the only country in the region that has pursued a clear policy of pluralism and has undergone significant internal change is indeed Iran. If there is one country in the world that should not require external help to rid itself of extremism it is Iran. If there is a regime that should not be given any motivation by the West to obtain nuclear weapons it is Iran. US and British policy in particular, however, is doing precisely that, rather than engaging in sensitive political negotiation. Iran should of course emphasise its determination to meet its international obligations. </p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out once again, however, that Parliament should support human rights and non-discrimination anywhere in the world. I shall make one final remark: in the territory of the EU Member States, there are so many social problems building up with an unavoidable human rights dimension that debate on the issue should also refer to these states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past two years, as many as six resolutions, statements and reports from various institutions and organisations on the subject of Iran have been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">To our sorrow, we cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the situation there has got worse rather than better. There is no freedom of opinion or of the press; the Internet is censored and independent newspapers closed down. There are apparently more jailed journalists in the Islamic Republic of Iran than anywhere else in the Middle East, and torture is a daily occurrence. Those of us who were members of the inter-parliamentary delegation were constantly assured, in many conversations, that the above assertions bore no relation to the facts. Unfortunately, those on the receiving end of such treatment tell another story.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no respect for women’s rights; for example, women are prevented from observing International Women’s Day publicly. A demonstration on 12 June by women and men who had campaigned against the legal discrimination against women was broken up violently.</p>
<p class="contents">That there has been a first visit to this House by a delegation from the Majlis has been a step in the right direction in seeking dialogue with parliamentarians and the general public, and respect for human rights and human dignity was at the heart of this debate, in which we were told that all the accusations levelled against Iran were far removed from the truth. We now call on the Iranians’ representative body – the Majlis – and the Iranian Government to do all in their power to confirm this by backing these statements up with actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran has also ground to a halt, and we should try to ensure its resumption. Perhaps, Commissioner, you might give some thought to the possibility of a radio and television station that would make possible broadcasts to Iran containing information about Europe and European policies, which would be of use to the people who live there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can one fail to establish a link between the election in June 2005 of the conservative and revisionist president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the growing trend of repression and persecution, the victims of which are not only the Arab, Azeri and Kurdish minorities and the religious minorities – Christians, Jews, Baha’is and Sufis – but also homosexuals and women, who are not a minority, but who continue to fall victim to countless forms of discrimination?</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to mention just two points in our resolution, I would point out, firstly, that Iran holds the world record for the highest number of executions of young people, bread or bicycle thieves and homosexuals. I would then point out that the government has declared that the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, which was cofounded by the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mrs Shirin Ebadi, is unlawful.</p>
<p class="contents">European diplomacy must make itself heard on such concrete examples as these. Given that the Iranian Government dares to state that the punishment of death by stoning no longer exists in the country, I call on the Commission to take up the case with Tehran of the 11 people who have been sentenced to death by stoning, and I have here the names of the nine women and two men sentenced.

<p class="contents">It is one of the oldest cultures in the world, and has been a world power for millennia; we must endeavour, by means of astute policies and diplomacy, to re-integrate it, step by step, into the international community, among those countries that co-exist as neighbours. If that is to happen, though, there must of course be some fundamental changes in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of minorities has also been brought up, and it is, in Iran – which is actually a multi-ethnic state, and so one cannot actually speak in terms of minorities – the various nations and ethnic groups have done a good job of living together since ancient times. It also showed greater religious tolerance than did many other states in the region, but the position today is such that the state’s official Islamic ideology makes life very difficult for minorities such as the Azeri or adherents of other religions, not least for other strands of Islam such as the Sufis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, though, there is certainly evidence coming out of Iran indicating that more and more self-confident women are going into politics, that a new generation is going down completely new paths and that this implies a great deal of hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore consider this multi-faceted structure as it is and without isolating it. We have to seek out contacts with the various communities and ethnic groups, and with every generation of this people, while at the same time making it clear that we do not accept under any circumstances rule by the police, the suppression of opinions, or the persecution of people by reason of their religious or other convictions, and that we repudiate all the more so the anti-Israel utterances of President Ahmadinejad, under whose leadership – it has to be said with some regret – conditions in this great country have taken a turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking energetic action to address that state of affairs is our duty as Europeans; if we are to do that, we need to cooperate with the United States of America, and I hope that one consequence of the latest political developments will be that cooperation with them on this issue will improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increasing number of reports concerning arrests of and threats against journalists is a particular cause for concern. Since the start of the year, at least 16 journalists have been arrested, which places Iran amongst the worst countries in the world in terms of restrictions imposed on the freedom of the press.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned by the fact that Iran, in spite of the European Union’s efforts, has not agreed to a second round of the dialogue on human rights which began in 2002. The time has come for the European Union to get tough and decisive in its talks with Iran on the issue of human rights.

Yet what does the current regime offer its people? Oppression, imprisonment, unemployment and censorship! President Ahmadinejad took office on 3 August 2005, since which time the situation has deteriorated. The present government offers its people ferocious corporal punishment. Six hundred children keep their mothers company in prison. Prisoners may have only three square metres in which to move around, but they are the lucky ones compared to those subjected to the death penalty. Iran even manages to execute more people than the USA. One hundred and eleven people have been executed in the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">The absolutely most flagrant breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran is indeed a signatory, however, is the death penalty for minors. A regime that does not allow young people to do their penance and mend their ways has no future; it will fall.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran has great potential, but while the regime there engages in persecuting academics, journalists and political activists instead of exploiting their potential, then the country and its people will continue to suffer. Many hands have been stretched out to Iran, and the European Parliament is stretching out another to it today. Release the political prisoners, the journalists and the representatives of minorities mentioned in today’s resolution. These are not big demands, but if they are met, the way can be paved for an improved dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the Iranian regime so scared of women? Let them participate, be elected, work, live and play their roles on the same terms as men. To do this is to double the potential for development in a society. There is hope. Already, UN delegations are being permitted to inspect various facilities, and a few political prisoners have been freed. However, the new government must seize the opportunity of adopting a policy that no longer shuts out the outside world and that gives women democratic rights. That is the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been suggested today that it is clear that we should cooperate with the United States, as the USA is a power which is prepared to intervene at moments when the European Union will not sanction a military intervention, at least until it has its own military capability. We have to develop an approach. Perhaps it would help to send out mass information to the people in these countries to show them that opportunities for development exist other than those exercised against them by their regimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes and supports the thrust of the draft resolutions concerning the Human Rights situation in Iran. Our assessment is that serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the country during 2006. In fact, there has been no progress in the EU’s main areas of concern, and in many respects the situation has worsened.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of examples is long and grim: an increased use of the death penalty and the occurrence of juvenile executions continue to be of grave concern; ethnic and religious minorities continue to suffer from discrimination; the status of women remains poor; freedom of expression has been further curtailed; and the closure of newspapers, intimidation and prosecution of journalists and the clampdown on bloggers have all continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has raised these concerns with the Iranian authorities during the past year, through both démarches and public statements. Unfortunately, as has been said in this House, it seems that the Iranian authorities are less willing than they have been in the past to take our requests into serious consideration or to make any tangible efforts to improve the situation. That said, some elements within the body politic, such as the Chief Judiciary, do appear somewhat committed to the cause of reform. However, given the overall deteriorating situation, the EU has decided to co-sponsor the Canadian resolution on the human rights situation in Iran in the UN Third Committee later this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Tehran maintains that the bilateral human rights dialogue and UN-type resolutions are mutually exclusive, it has signalled that it would consider calling off the session of the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights, scheduled for December. We, of course, firmly reject any such link. We still aim to resume the dialogue shortly. We remain convinced that constructive dialogue, accompanied by cooperative projects both bilaterally and through UN agencies is the most realistic means to engage in the field of human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Prets has suggested that the Union should sponsor radio or television programmes. I am not competent to give an affirmative response to that, but as regards people-to-people contacts it is worth noting that one million Iranians visited Turkey in 2005. They went there in order to breathe some fresh air, watch ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ and check out the benchmark of democracy in that troubled region.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the matter in our relations with Iran is that, irrespective of positive or negative developments on the nuclear issue, which is extremely important, without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with that country cannot develop properly, no matter how much potential our relationship might otherwise have in terms of economic and energy cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Delegation for relations with Iran, chaired by Mrs Beer. I welcome your efforts to develop contacts with your interlocutors from the Majlis, as well as with the widest possible spectrum of Iranian society. The recent visit to this House by Mr Akbar Ganji – whose liberation we all worked tirelessly for – is an important case in point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has presented a report emphasising that there is a need to introduce a total ban on cod fishing in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and Kattegat during 2007. The Swedish Board of Fisheries gives its backing to the report and maintains that a total ban is essential if cod stocks are to recover. Criticism has also been levelled at the current quota system. The Swedish Fishermen's Federation and the recently appointed Swedish Minister for Fisheries advocate fishing days rather than fish quotas. At the present time, large quantities of cod are thrown overboard in order to comply with the quota rules.</p>
<p>Will the Presidency advocate a total ban on cod fishing in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and Kattegat? What are the Presidency's views on the proposal to introduce specific fishing days instead of a quota system?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>The situation regarding cod stocks in the areas which the honourable Member mentions has been a matter of concern for all relevant parties for many years now, and has resulted in several measures being adopted to restrict fishing. Although there are some positive signs in sight, more work is clearly needed for cod stocks to recover to a sustainable level in the long term. The measures introduced so far have been the North Sea cod recovery plan, reducing annual quotas, increasing net mesh size, fishing ban zones, fishing ban times, especially the spawning season, and lowering the number of fishing days.</p>
<p>The Council will be taking a decision on the Commission’s proposal for the annual management of cod fishing. Towards the end of November, the Commission is expected to put forward a proposal, based on opinions submitted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which endorses Total Allowable Catches (TACs), quotas and other measures relating to the issue for the year 2007. Consequently, the Council cannot say what this proposal will consist of or how the Member States will react to it.</p>
<p>The Presidency proposes to steer discussions, on what is normally a troublesome subject, with the positive and constructive aim of reaching a decision at the Council sitting in December.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0916"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency, which is binding neither on the Council nor its Members, was not given orally during Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's November 2006 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Preventing and combating smoking is already a priority health-policy objective in the Member States and the European Community.</p>
<p>In its recommendation of 2 December 2002 on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Council notes that, given the health risks associated with passive smoking, Member States should aim to protect smokers and non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke. The Council recommends that the Member States should:</p>
<p>enact or implement legislation and/or other effective measures to protect people from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, enclosed public places and public transport;</p>
<p>continue to develop strategies and measures to reduce tobacco consumption, such as strengthening overall health education, peculiarly in schools, and general programmes to discourage the initial use of tobacco products and to help people overcome tobacco addiction.</p>
<p>The recommendation calls on the Commission to report on the implementation of the proposed measures, on the basis of information supplied by the Member States. The report to be submitted in 2007 will assess the effectiveness of the measures set out in the recommendation and the need for further measures.</p>
<p>The aim of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which came into force on 27 February 2005, is to protect current and future generations against tobacco consumption and prevent environmental pollution through tobacco use. The Commission and all the Member States with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic have ratified the Framework Convention, which lays down a specific obligation, binding on the parties, requiring them to protect people against exposure to tobacco smoke. Pursuant to Article 8 of the Framework Convention, each contracting party must enact and implement effective measures providing for protection from passive smoking in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.</p>
<p>At the first conference of the contracting parties to the Framework Convention, held in Geneva in February 2006, the Community and its Member States made a significant contribution to the discussion of the decision on the framing of guidelines for the implementation of the Framework Convention as regards protection from passive smoking. A start has now been made on drawing up the guidelines, which will specify all the factors fundamental to the implementation of Article 8.</p>
<p>It is solely a matter for the competent Member State authorities to enact measures such as a ban on smoking or the provision of counselling programmes for people who give up smoking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council’s objective remains a safer Europe in a more just world. The European security strategy adopted in December 2003 set out the means by which the EU seeks to attain this objective.</p>
<p>As regards the examples cited by the Honourable Member, the Council can reply as follows:</p>
<p>Iraq</p>
<p>The European Union continues to support the government of national unity headed by Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in implementing its programme, including the government’s proposed national reconciliation and dialogue plan. The EU is actively involved in drafting the International Compact together with the Iraqi government, the UN and other partners in the international community. This compact is an important opportunity for the Iraqi government to commit itself to difficult but necessary reforms in the political, security and economic fields and for the international community to commit itself to supporting these reforms.</p>
<p>The European Union supported Iraq’s referendum on elections and the constitution and intends to support the democracy process in Iraq in future too. The EU is continuing with its comprehensive aid programme supported by Iraq and has also continued, at Iraq’s request, with its Integrated Rule of Law mission for Iraq (EUJUST LEX). Thanks to this mission, training in the Rule of Law has so far been given to some 800 Iraqi police officers, judges and prison officers. There are plans to begin negotiations in the near future on a trade and cooperation agreement with Iraq. The EU’s close political dialogue with Iraq is also continuing.</p>
<p>Iran</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its readiness to develop sustainable long-term relations with Iran and has always supported efforts towards a diplomatic solution on the issue of Iran’s nuclear power.<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>The deadline of 31 July 2006 set in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 has passed, and the EU has expressed its deep concern at the fact that Iran has still not yet halted its uranium enrichment activities.</p>
<p>In his contacts with the Iranian authorities, the EU’s High Representative has continually called on Iran to put into practice the measures referred to in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and demanded by the IAEA Administrative Council.</p>
<p>Iran has not as yet shown any willingness to comply with the demand to halt its uranium enrichment activities. Halting such activities is a precondition for the negotiations, supported by the EU, for a new initiative on the basis of the offer made by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and the USA.</p>
<p>In its resolution 1696 the Security Council expressed its intention to adopt appropriate measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter if Iran does not comply with its demands. The Council considered that the fact that Iran is continuing its uranium enrichment activities leaves the EU no choice but to support consultations on such measures.</p>
<p>However, on 17 October the Council noted that Iran still has the option to negotiate and strongly urged Iran to choose the positive course of action proposed.</p>
<p>On 6 June 2006 the EU’s High Representative set out to Iran the proposals of six states (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the Russian Federation and the USA). These far-reaching proposals would serve as the basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran all it needed to develop a modern civilian nuclear energy sector, while also taking account of international concerns.</p>
<p>Opting for such a positive course of action would pave the way for new relations with Iran, based on mutual respect and wider cooperation in the political and economic spheres.</p>
<p>North Korea</p>
<p>When the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea proclaimed a nuclear test, the Council strongly condemned, in its conclusions adopted on 17 October on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the test of a nuclear explosive device, which it considered poses a danger to regional stability and represents a clear threat to international peace and security. It indicated that the EU will fully implement the provisions of all relevant UNSC Resolutions and notably of Resolution 1718 (2006) and of Resolution 1695 (2006).</p>
<p>The sanctions set out in the UN Security Council’s resolution include a ban on the export of sensitive products and sensitive technology which might promote North Korea’s nuclear-related, other weapons of mass destruction-related and ballistic missile-related programmes, and a ban on supplying services relating thereto, a ban on the procurement of sensitive products and sensitive technology from North Korea, a ban on the export of luxury goods and a freeze on the funds and economic resources of persons, communities and bodies which participate in or support the above-mentioned North Korean programmes.</p>
<p>In its conclusions the Council also called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to return immediately to the six-party negotiations.</p>
<p>The Presidency later expressed its satisfaction at the fact that China, the Democratic Republic of Korea and the USA had reached a consensus in Beijing on 31 October on holding a meeting in the near future in the context of the six-party negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>On 18 July, the Commission put forward a proposal in accordance with the provisions of the current Postal Services Directive 97/67/EC<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC, for a Directive of the European Parliament and Council concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. On 20 October 2006, the Council received the proposal in question, a Commission report on the application of the Postal Directive<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Commission’s prospective study on the impact on universal service of the full accomplishment of the postal internal market in 2009<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Furthermore, with regard to its Communication entitled ‘Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs in the European Union’<a href="#defann_8_5" name="refann_8_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, the Commission conducted an Impact Assessment <a href="#defann_8_6" name="refann_8_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and submitted it to the European Parliament and the Council. This sheds light on the economic and social effects of different options on users and all relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Commission only put the proposal forward a short time ago, so the Council has only just started looking at it. It would be premature at this stage to adopt a position on the details in the proposal or to comment on the documents annexed to it without it pre-empting the outcome of the discussions on the subject in the Council over the months to come.</p>
<p>The Council of the European Union emphasises its commitment to working closely with the European Parliament in this matter, and would like to state that it has decided to make a thorough analysis, over an appropriate timescale, of all the relevant critical parameters and threshold issues, and our priority aim will be to safeguard an efficient, sustainable and competitive EU postal sector, which would still have to provide a reasonably priced and first-rate service to all European citizens and businesses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer, which has been drafted by the Presidency, and which in itself is not binding on the Council or its members, was not presented orally in Council question time in the part-session held by the European Parliament in Strasbourg in November 2006.</p>
<p>In the Council’s opinion, the conflict in Western Sahara continues to be a major barrier to stability, cooperation and prosperity in the region. The Council is convinced that more effective cooperation in the Maghreb countries would benefit them, and it has urged them to work to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Council fully supports the attempts by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum to achieve a solution to the West Saharan conflict that is just, lasting and acceptable to both sides. It would give the people of the Western Sahara the right to self-determination under, for example, the most recent Security Council Regulation 1720, passed on 31 October 2006.</p>
<p>The Council has encouraged the parties to try and reach such a solution and act to bring it about in constructive, flexible cooperation with the UN Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has reminded Morocco and Algeria that one of the aims of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the enhancement of good neighbourly relations to prevent and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>The Council has always focussed close attention on the humanitarian aspects of the conflict in Western Sahara. The Council has been actively involved in these issues, and has urged the parties to implement more concrete measures to resolve the remaining humanitarian problems. The Council has also said that it is worried about alleged human rights violations in Western Sahara and in the camps at Tindouf, and has put forward official contacts for the parties to address this issue.</p>
<p>The Western Sahara issue is regularly discussed at meetings under the EU-Morocco Association Agreement. The Council made special mention of the issue at the end of 2005 at the Reinforced Political Dialogue meeting on 9 November 2005 and the fifth meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council on 22 November 2005.

<p>The Council may not at this stage reveal the details of the new agreement being negotiated with the Russian Federation, as negotiations directives are still being debated by the relevant Council bodies.</p>
<p>The Council may, however, inform the honourable Member that the parties at the last EU-Russia Summit held in Sochi on 25 May 2006 reached a common view on the following in talks on the new agreement:</p>
<p>EU-Russian relations will continue to be based on the agreements.</p>
<p>The new legally binding instrument should provide relations between us with a lasting and comprehensive framework.</p>
<p>This new agreement should also cover opportunities for greater trade and economic integration after Russia has acceded to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Neither party to the agreement will disassociate itself from the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement before the new framework takes effect, in order to avoid a legally unregulated state of affairs.</p>
<p>Our aim is to reach a decision on the commencement of talks with Russia about the new agreement at the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki on 24 November 2006. It is still not known when the agreement is to be concluded. It is not yet clear which Member State will be holding the Presidency when the agreement is signed, as it depends on how long the negotiations with Russia last.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0875"></a>

<p>(FR) The role of decent work in reducing poverty and of the need to step up efforts to promote decent work via development cooperation have benefited from increased recognition. This recognition can be seen both in the Commission communication entitled ‘Promoting decent work for all’ and in the European consensus for development (2005), which enshrines employment and social cohesion, including decent work, as one of the newest areas of Community action. These issues also form an integral part of the EU’s strategy for Africa, of cooperation with Latin America and of action plans in the context of cooperation between the EC and partner countries covered by the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p>The Commission is already funding some programmes in support of decent work or aspects thereof in different partner regions and countries.</p>
<p>These programmes are based, inter alia, on support for enhancing vocational training with a view to increasing the opportunities for job seekers to find decent work, support for social action funds for local development, which assist vulnerable communities, support for social integration, revenue generation and the economic reintegration of vulnerable sections of society such as displaced persons, demobilised soldiers and indigenous peoples. In spite of this, employment, social cohesion and decent work were not covered by most of the external cooperation programmes and projects for the 2000-2006 period.</p>
<p>The Commission does not, however, grant independent funding for each of the fields in which we cooperate with our partner countries and this applies to issues relating to decent work. Our cooperation works on the principle of national ownership and we must respect our partner countries’ choices as regards their priorities for cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p>The programming process of the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) has not yet been concluded and accordingly we do not have definitive information on the distribution of appropriations between the different priority areas. That being the case, we do not have specific information on appropriations for promoting decent work.</p>
<p>At a more advanced stage are the programming of our cooperation with non-ACP (African, Caribbean, Pacific) countries – as in the case of Latin America, Asia and Central Asia, for example – and the European neighbourhood policy. It would be premature, however, even here, to offer definitive figures on specific financial appropriations, given that the final version of strategy documents on these countries and regions has yet to be drawn up. The Member States and Parliament will also have their say on the content of these documents before their adoption in the dialogue between the institutions provided for on such matters.</p>
<p>In addition to programming per country, the thematic programme ‘Investing in human resources’ will, starting in 2007, finance innovation, worldwide partnerships and practical measures in key areas of human and social development, including decent work. In this area, too, funding has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Support can also be granted to the social partners from 2007, in the context of the thematic programme entitled ‘non-state actors and local authorities in development policy’. Furthermore, aid can be earmarked to promote core labour standards due to the new European instrument for democracy and human rights. Support for initiatives aimed at improving the management of economic migration for the benefit of both countries of origin and host countries will also contribute towards promoting decent work. Such support is provided for by the Aeneas programme and will be available from 2007 within the 'migration and asylum' programme.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to highlight the fact that, far from being a simple matter of employment or social protection, decent work is, more than anything, a matter of ‘governance’. The implementation of effective policies aimed at decent work requires well-managed institutions, so that decent work can be promoted effectively.</p>
<p>This is why, in the tenth EDF, the Commission proposed the granting of an incentive tranche, which will be linked to our partner countries’ programme, on a series of governance-related issues, including the signing and ratification of the eight fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation. The Commission is convinced that this key initiative will play an important role in promoting decent work in the partner countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0880"></a>

<p>(FR) Around 2.2 million people, mostly children, die each year in the developing world from diseases associated with a lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene. This is one of the main causes of sickness and death in developing countries.</p>
<p>Not only is the EU the biggest provider of development aid among donor countries, but it is also the biggest provider of development aid for water and sanitation, with an annual budget of around € 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2005 the Commission committed € 1 283 million to water and sanitation for developing countries. The figures for 2006 are not yet known and those for the period prior to 2002 are not comparable. The Commission estimates that approximately 25% of these sums are intended for sanitation.</p>
<p>The Commission prepares and carries out its water and sanitation activities in the context of strategy papers and national and regional indicative programmes. These documents are drawn up in consultation with the partner countries and reflect the national priorities and requirements of the aid beneficiaries. New country strategy papers are being drawn up in partnership with the beneficiary countries, which will cover financing from the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF) (2008-2013) and the EU budget (2007-2012). Details of new commitments are not yet available.</p>
<p>The second part of the question relates to the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership on Water and Sanitation, signed by African and European heads of state at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and implemented via the African component of the European Water Initiative.</p>
<p>The EU’s Water Initiative is not a financial instrument for providing aid. It is a concerted effort on the part of the Commission, Member States, partner countries and other relevant parties, including civil society organisations and local governments, to work together to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The effects of the initiative have been slow in coming, but a number of significant achievements have nevertheless been made:</p>
<p>-	the initiative has established dialogues between the partner country governments, the relevant parties and the EU with a view to helping partner countries develop and implement policies, strategies and priorities for water and sanitation which donors can support; there has been slow progress and some success in developing these dialogues. By stressing the broad participation of civil society they have provided an opportunity for African civil organisations to be heard;</p>
<p>-	the initiative has developed activities for coordinating donors in order to help improve aid effectiveness (notably in Ethiopia);</p>
<p>-	the initiative has launched five regional cross-border water management projects in Africa;</p>
<p>-	the ACP-EU Water Facility, set up in 2004 with total funding of € 500 million from the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, is a direct result of the political impetus generated by the European Water Initiative and a reflection of the importance which the EU attaches to water and sanitation;</p>
<p>-	the European Water Initiative has helped to strengthen the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and facilitate participation by AMCOW in the political debate on water at regional and international level;</p>
<p>-	the contribution from the Commission’s 6<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme to the objectives of the European initiative has led to the creation of more than 50 new research projects, for which the Commission’s combined contribution is approximately € 28 million. A good example is the SWITCH project (Sustainable Water management Improves Tomorrow’s Cities’ Health), which will receive over € 14 million (€ 14 749 997) from the Commission spread over five years. This project tackles sanitation problems in various parts of the world based on specific case studies carried out in a number of cities in the developing world, including Bogota, Cali, Lima, Belo Horizonte, Accra, Alexandria and Beijing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0884"></a>

<p>(FR) Civil society has a crucial role to play in the process of drawing up country strategy papers because of its twin calling as an essential player in aid provision and as a strategic partner capable of advancing political, economic and social dialogue. The Commission is alive to this and must play a significant role by facilitating constructive and ongoing interaction between national public authorities and a broad range of civil society organisations - a fundamental factor in a country’s development and for enabling all sections of the population to take ownership of development strategies.</p>
<p>Under the 9th European Development Fund (EDF), civil society in African, Caribbean and pacific countries (ACP countries) has participated in the programming process for the first time. Two Commission reports have assessed the progress made in fostering participatory approaches: the first focused on civil society participation in drawing up country strategy papers for the ACP states (2003); the second was drawn up during the mid-term review of country strategy papers. For the second report, various tools were used to obtain information on best practices. In particular, a detailed country-specific questionnaire was sent to regional desk officers and chiefly covered the following aspects: the national context, civil society participation in discussions on what policy should be followed and on policy implementation, the use of resources allocated for capacity building for non-state actors (NSA), the degree and quality of NSA participation and overall trends concerning that participation. In addition to the Commission’s in-house information sources (joint annual reports, analysis of conclusions of mid-term reviews, and funding proposals and agreements), use was made of other documentation, including assessments by social and economic partners, questionnaires and assessments from the ACP-EU Follow-Up Committee of at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and other, very useful documentary and field studies carried out by civil society organisations.</p>
<p>Our willingness to foster the participation and ownership principles has also been incorporated as one of the basic tenets of the programming exercise, currently under way, for the 10th EDF. The programming orientations put this as follows:</p>
<p>‘Consultation with local authorities and non state actors is an essential feature of the exercise. They should be involved at different stages of the programming process and in particular be given the possibility of contributing to and commenting upon the CSP/RSP<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.’</p>
<p>To ensure that all partners involved in the programming process can participate fully, the orientations have been shared with them and posted on the Internet. The guidelines also state that NSA are ‘eligible for financial support under the (Cotonou) agreement’ and that strategy papers must ‘provide information on the use of EDF resources to foster the emergence of NSA and the development of their capacities’.</p>
<p>National parliaments, being guarantors of democratic legitimacy, must play a major role in promoting sound public management in the ACP-EU partnership context, in particular via the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. The Commission, through the ongoing dialogue it maintains with partner authorities and regions, encourages, at various levels, the maximum possible involvement of institutions, especially parliaments. This positive approach is reflected in a number of strategy documents, including the revised Cotonou Agreement and the ‘European Consensus on Development’, which acknowledges the essential oversight role of citizens’ democratically elected representatives, particularly within national assemblies, parliaments and local authorities. Each ACP country is free to determine the best way of involving and informing its national parliament, however, and it is not for the Commission to take specific measures to adopt practical arrangements in this connection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission takes very seriously the risk that the budgetary aid it provides may not achieve the goal of improving the quantity and quality of the services provided to the neediest.</p>
<p>In order to curb this risk, the Commission has developed an innovative, results-based approach, establishing a link between the sums paid out and the results obtained through a set of indicators approved by the country concerned that make it possible to check whether there has been a genuine improvement in public social services (vaccination or schooling of young girls, for example).</p>
<p>In order to achieve a greater impact among the neediest sections of the population, some programmes set objectives which are based not on national averages, but refer to the least favoured regions, where access to basic services in more problematic. This is the case in Mali, for example, where budgetary support is given for decentralisation through the Programme to support Administrative Reform and Decentralisation (PARAD).</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission prefers to transfer funds directly to national treasuries, rather than to local authorities, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Given that such transfers would entail a change in the distribution of resources compared to the original state budget, by so doing the Commission would reduce its partner's control over budgetary policy, while at the same time affecting its system of public finance management, thereby weakening the tools needed to strengthen the State in order to develop coherent regional development policies, which are often lacking for want of resources.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and more realistically, paying budgetary aid directly to local authorities might well prompt the central authorities to change the way they distribute resources to local authorities, by deducting the resources provided by the EC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given that the national budget includes transfers to local authorities, these transfers, like other expenditure included in the budget, will benefit from budgetary support. This is the case, for example, with budgetary aid provided to Honduras to support decentralisation and Jordan to promote local development.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Commission has different ways of including the local dimension in its budget support programmes:</p>
<p>By including the monitoring of budget transfers to local authorities among the subjects discussed during annual reviews, as part of the dialogue with governments, or even in some cases by setting conditions for the granting of budget support.</p>
<p>By introducing sectoral budget support, particularly in the education and health sectors, incorporating the decentralisation process, as has been done in Nicaragua or the Philippines, for example.</p>
<p>By backing up budget support with capacity-building for central, decentralised and local services responsible for the management of public finances.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0937"></a>

<p>(FR) The answer to this question can be split into two parts:</p>
<p>1.	How to take account of isolation in the allocation of funding among countries;</p>
<p>2.	How to ensure that those without a voice are taken into account in each country’s national programming.</p>
<p>The answer to each of these sub-questions can be found in the European Consensus on the Union’s development policy.</p>
<p>1.	Criteria for the allocation of funding:</p>
<p>The European Consensus states that development resources should be allocated in an objective and transparent way, based on the needs and performance of the beneficiary countries. It tries to define the concept of poverty according to criteria of needs, such as the level of access to basic education and water, infant mortality or the degree of malnutrition.</p>
<p>In addition to these general indicators there are indicators of social cohesion. For the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, in accordance with the ACP-EC partnership agreement the characteristics of landlocked or island territories are explicitly taken into account in the allocation of aid. To these are added other criteria of isolation, such as the relative cost of transport compared with the principal external markets and the ratio between the size of the territory and the non-urban population, in order to take account of the additional costs involved in ensuring basic social services for the populations farthest away from urban centres.</p>
<p>2.	The programming process</p>
<p>The European Consensus points out that in addition to allocating funds among countries the primary objective of EU development cooperation is the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Strategy Papers make a detailed analysis of the problems of poverty and the responses proposed by our partner countries so as to be able to propose response strategies in order to make an effective contribution to reducing poverty. Indicators of the performance of cooperation will be identified in order to make it possible to monitor the progress made in this field.</p>
<p>In order to achieve significant and lasting results, the European Consensus also insists on more structured cooperation using a sectoral approach rather than a project-based approach, so as to ensure that our measures are part of a global development strategy.</p>
<p>The representatives of non-State actors are involved in the programming process, and coordination between stakeholders, including other donors, should ensure that no vulnerable group is overlooked in the programming process.</p>
<p>The identification of conflict-prevention and regional planning, including support for decentralisation processes and local development, as integral parts of our cooperation priorities should also ensure that the problems of minorities and the neediest populations can be taken into account fully in the implementation of cooperation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the instrument for human rights (European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights - EIDHR) and the thematic programme ‘Non-state actors and Local Authorities in Development’ will help the Commission to tackle specific problems in contexts other than cooperation with governments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0950"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission is one of the biggest donors of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees living in camps in South West Algeria. Since 1993, EUR 117 million has been earmarked for meeting the refugees’ needs.</p>
<p>Aid granted in the tax year 2006 has totalled EUR 10.9 million, an increase on the EUR 9 311 000 in aid granted in the 2005 budget. Two financial decisions have been adopted. The first was in February 2006 to address the emergency caused by flooding that affected the camps (EUR 900 000) and the second in July 2006 to respond to recurring human needs as of September 2006 (EUR 10 million).</p>
<p>The Commission’s aid is aimed first and foremost at responding to the refugees’ food requirements, via, on the one hand, funding from the World Food Programme (WFP) for basic food commodities, and on the other hand funding from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for supplying fresh produce. This twin approach will help to meet the refugees’ basic food needs, as well as diversifying what they eat, with vitamins and micronutrients. This will also be something of a response to the recommendations contained in the UN High Commission for Refugees / WFP nutritional study of 2005, which highlighted a deterioration in the refugees' nutritional situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Commission aid is aimed at improving the refugees' living conditions from a multisectoral perspective. Within the framework of the 2006 funding decision, which covers the last third of 2006 and much of 2007 – in addition to food aid, which accounts for half of the finance – support for NGO projects and UN agencies has been planned in a number of areas, including: the distribution of hygiene kits (for women), distribution of tents, support for the health system, waste management, water supply, activities for school-age children and the handicapped, and vaccination.</p>
<p>In addition to providing humanitarian aid, the Commission intends to use its permanent presence in Algiers and its regular visits to the camps to ensure that the projects it finances are monitored, ongoing needs assessments are carried out and aid efforts undertaken by the different donor organisations are coordinated. In this regard, the Commission is aware of the critical situation of the WFP’s ‘food pipeline’, which has led to emergency appeals from a number of organisations. Nevertheless, the Commission has since become aware of a number of contributions from donors to the WFP, ensuring that basic food needs are covered until the end of 2006. There may be some logistical difficulties in transporting the food products for November 2006 distribution. The Commission feels that there is no point in adopting special emergency measures but that humanitarian aid must continue to be implemented, as provided for by the 2006 funding decision, in order to prevent further setbacks in the delivery of aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0907"></a>

<p>(EN) Consumer price inflation in Greece as measured by the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) has been for some years now among the highest in the euro-zone. However, a structural gap between producer and consumer prices cannot be observed, since for the last two years (i.e. comparing August 2006 with September 2004) the index of producer prices and the HICP for Greece differed on average by only two index points. Over the same period consumer prices for energy in Greece increased by around 30%, while consumer prices excluding energy increased by 3%.</p>
<p>More generally, it should be clearly noted that price increases can depend on various factors and are not always the result of anti-competitive practices.</p>
<p>To the extent that an increase in consumer prices for a product or service in the territory of a Member State is the consequence of anticompetitive practices that violate the EC competition rules, these can be pursued by the national competition authority, by private plaintiffs before national courts or by the Commission. Very often, the national competition authority will be well placed to deal with such cases. Consistency in the enforcement of EC competition rules is ensured in the framework of the European Competition Network. If ever the situation arose where there was a serious risk that EC competition law would be improperly or inadequately applied, the Commission has the power to relieve the national competition authority concerned of the competence to deal with the case. To date, such a case has never arisen in practice.</p>
<p>The Commission has received no indication to suggest that the Greek competition authority and the Greek independent regulatory commissions are not cooperating properly in the execution of their tasks. Recent developments in Greek competition law have provided the Greek competition authority with stronger enforcement powers that should enable it to further step up enforcement against infringements of competition law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0938"></a>

<p>(EN) The Preliminary Report of the Commission's sector inquiry into competition in gas markets confirmed that the majority of long-term contracts link the price for gas to the price of oil or oil derivatives. Gas prices were also found to be indexed, although to a lesser extent, to prices of gas traded at hubs, coal prices, electricity prices and general inflation indices.</p>
<p>The linking of oil and natural gas prices is based on the assumption that natural gas can be substituted for oil. Gas-to-gas competition, where prices are based solely upon the supply and demand for gas, would provide the market with more efficient pricing mechanisms. The Commission is therefore taking steps to promote the development of gas to gas competition within a competitive internal gas market.</p>
<p>Natural gas was first introduced into the Greek energy market in November 1996. Greece holds exemptions from certain provisions of the Gas Directive as an emergent market under Article 28 paragraph 2 of that Directive. As a result the majority of the provisions of the Gas Directive will only be applicable in Greece from 15 November 2006.</p>
<p>In December 2005, Greece adopted law 3428 transposing the entirety of the Gas Directive.

<p>Based on today’s burden of cervical cancer, estimates indicate that about 32,000 cancers in women could be prevented by this vaccine.</p>
<p>Considering that today several hundred thousand women per year in EU 25 are diagnosed with advanced precancerous lesions, which have to be clinically treated, the positive impact of a vaccine which could prevent 80% of these lesions could be enormous.</p>
<p>In this situation, the Commission will move on several fronts in helping to identify best practice, in addressing evidence gaps by research and development under the future 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme and in updating and promoting the European Code against cancer, which since 2003 contains a recommendation on primary prevention of liver cancer by vaccination against the Hepatitis B virus.</p>
<p>This will further include the publication and promotion of the EU guidelines on quality assurance in cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. The guidelines are expected to appear in the first half of 2007. They will discuss Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing and vaccination in special chapters.</p>
<p>In addition, a new proposal to update the EU guidelines on quality assurance in breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnosis has been selected for financing under the health programme 2003-2008. This will address HPV vaccination with priority.</p>
<p>The European Cancer Network will be asked to extend its implementation and impact report to include a detailed analysis of the expected impact of HPV vaccination on the prevention of cervical cancer and on best practice in screening.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to covering needs for information and consultation in the new Member States, Acceeding and Candidate countries and to integrating their relevant experts.</p>
<p>This will ensure that knowledge and motivation will grow for an efficient implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening and the related EU guidelines in all Member States.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission considers inviting a group of experts from the two networks, from the World Health Organisation/International Agency for Research on Cancer, and from Member States and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to assess the status quo and possible ways forward.</p>
<p>Preventing health risks in order to maintain a healthy and competitive labour force is part of the recently adopted strategic guidelines for cohesion policy 2007-2013, in particular in the convergence regions. The objective is to increase the number of healthy years at work and maintain an active participation in society of as many people as possible. This includes ensuring that health services have the necessary skills, products and equipment to prevent risks and minimise their potential damage. Actions will cover both health infrastructure and training of health professionals. In addition, actions aimed at health promotion, disease prevention and transfer of knowledge will be supported.</p>
<p>Cervical cancer has to be tackled. And best practice examples show that significant results can be obtained.</p>
<p>A coherent, collaborative approach is needed, notably covering the new aspect of vaccination against this cancer.</p>
<p>The action is principally for the Member States, but the EU can and will provide support, as in the case of research and cohesion policies where possible.</p>
<p>About half a million women each year depend on such action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0878"></a>

<p>(EN) In September 2006 the Commission together with Member State experts, carried out a mission to Lebanon to assess the damages. The mission collected extensive data via 450 standardised fiches and questionnaires covering more than 100 locations. Field visits were carried out to these locations. The assessment covered damages to public assets and infrastructure, in the fields of transport (roads and bridges), water, energy, health and education. The mission focused its field visits on the most damaged districts, Tyre, Bint Jbeil, Marjayoun, Natbatyeh and Baabda; mainly in Southern Lebanon, as well as to Beqaa.</p>
<p>For the sectors targeted by the mission, the direct costs of damage to public infrastructure were estimated at €83 million. This estimation made by the EU team is broadly 1/3 of the estimates already presented by other sources, including those of the Government. This is for a number of reasons. In particular, the assessment covered only the main sectors of public infrastructure. Furthermore the focus was on direct damage (rehabilitation and replacement cost) whereas other estimates could include pre-existing needs or site redevelopment. The price estimates by the EU team also reflect market prices in an after-war situation, whereas the previous price estimations reflected higher prices applicable during the war.</p>
<p>An assessment of damages to private housing was not a core part of the mission; however, estimates from other sources indicate the damage to private housing ranges from broadly €800 million to €1.4 billion; also lower that the initial estimates.</p>
<p>Follow-up missions are being undertaken to assess how the Commission can reorient the funding already available and for future assistance. As far as the Commission is aware, Israel has not indicated any intention to currently bear any cost related to the reconstruction of Lebanon.</p>
<p>The Commission considers it vital, particularly in a crisis, to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open with all Euro-Mediterranean partners. Therefore, the Commission is not considering taking sanctions like those suggested which would likely affect negatively the EU's influence in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0882"></a>

<p>(EN) On 5 October 2006, the Council adopted the measures proposed by the Commission to tackle the dumping of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear in the European Union.</p>
<p>The full findings of the investigation as well as the details of how the level of dumping and injury to the EU industry were established and the appropriate level of duties determined in this case are set out in detail in Council Regulation (EC) No 1472/2006 of 5 October 2006<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These measures offer a balanced solution in a complex case, because free trade means also fair trade; a solution responding to the clear evidence of unfair competitive practices and State intervention, which would not be allowed under EC competition law and which has enabled Chinese and Vietnamese companies to engage in dumping in the European Union.</p>
<p>A comprehensive impact assessment analysis of the measures on consumers in the EC market was carried out. In all likelihood there will be no, or only a marginal effect of the duties on consumer prices, because there is a huge mark up between the import prices of shoes and the prices paid by consumers. Indeed, average import price of the footwear is around €8,5. A duty of 10% on this price is only €0,85 while consumers pay prices of between €50 and €130. There is thus sufficient space for the duty to be absorbed within the distribution chain.</p>
<p>No statistical data are available about the number of European companies in the footwear sector which have directly invested in manufacturing sites in China and Vietnam. Though the footwear case has shown that some European enterprises indeed have set up own production facilities in East Asia, outsourcing in the form of subcontracting to independent Asian manufacturers appears to be more common. In fact, none of the thirteen sampled Chinese exporting producers or any of the sampled eight Vietnamese companies in the footwear investigation was owned by European companies.</p>
<p>As indicated in recital 325 of the Regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping measures in the footwear case import trends following the imposition of measures are subject to an import surveillance system. Such system has already been in place since the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures in April 2006. These data are available in the public domain. In addition, the development of retail prices in the footwear sector is under constant monitoring as well.</p>
<p>It is not a key objective of anti-dumping measures to block imports, such measures are not quantitative restrictions, but only serve to redress unfair pricing strategies. Given that in the case at hand measures are only in place for a relatively short period of time, and in particular due to their gradual phase- in it would be premature to identify already at this stage unambiguous impact trends of the measures on import flows. The Commission will continue monitoring this issue. However, it should be mentioned that Vietnam has increased its footwear exports to the United States of America according to press reports. It is not envisaged to automatically follow up with public reports, unless unexpected circumstances and developments call for further reflection in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>No evidence exists that the measures in place could lead to dramatic job losses in China and Vietnam. In fact, the dimension of this case needs to be put into perspective. Only around 18 % of the total import volume of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear of all types to the EC is now covered by measures, i.e. only certain leather footwear not including e.g. high tech sport shoes ("STAF") is concerned. Clearly, China and Vietnam will continue to have ample opportunity to supply EC consumers with their shoes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the footwear industry is not only important for China and Vietnam. In this context it might be worth to recall that with some 200.000 employees in the EC manufacturing footwear, often in regions with little alternative sources for employment, this sector plays an important role for the European economy as well. EU footwear producers are world wide renowned for their design, know how and quality production. Unfair trading practices, targeted to undermine their competitive edge, are not acceptable.</p>

<p>(EN) There are two basic ways of importing garlic fraudulently:</p>
<p>misdescription of origin, and</p>
<p>more recently, misdescription of the product.</p>
<p>In order to fight against the first method, the Commission introduced two measures:</p>
<p>-	Further to OLAF’s<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> operational activities, a 'Notice to importers' was published in August 2005 in the "C" series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in which Community operators were advised to take all necessary precautions against this kind of fraud.</p>
<p>-	Since January 2006, all imports of garlic are subject to the issue of an import licence.</p>
<p>As a result, the incidence of this kind of fraud has decreased: imports from third countries other than Argentina and China during January-June 2006 were 75% of the imports during the same period in 2005, and 65% of the average imports of the same period from 2001 to 2005.</p>
<p>Due to its nature, the second kind of fraud is more difficult to tackle. The Commission would like to emphasise the responsibility of the Member States' customs authorities in this particular context, because the only way to really combat this kind of fraud is physical control upon importation.</p>
<p>It should also be emphasised, that there seem to be no major disturbances on the European garlic market since 2001. On the contrary, it even seems to be improving.</p>
<p>To sum up, with the measures already in place, Community garlic producers seem to be sufficiently protected. However, given the potential high losses to the Community Budget, the Commission will study whether further measures are necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This case involves possible violations of fundamental property law by the Greek Government in Greece. Their dispute with the Greek Government is restricted to issues involving the exercise of their rights as co-proprietors of land for building, which has nothing to do with Community law.

<p>(EN) On 18 October 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This Directive confirms the date of 2009 for the full accomplishment of the postal internal market and maintains the framework for ensuring a high quality and affordable universal service.</p>
<p>The preparatory work was based on numerous sector studies including two instigated by the Commission in 2005/2006. Furthermore, appropriate information about developments in the sector, particularly concerning economic, social, employment and technological aspects, as well as about quality of service is to be found in the third Report to the Council and the Parliament on the application of the Postal Directive<a href="#defann_31_4" name="refann_31_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This document contains a detailed Annex containing specific information on the issues raised by the Honourable Member. With regard to the effects of full market opening on the universal service, a Report to the Council and the Parliament ('Commission's prospective study on the impact on universal service of the full accomplishment of the postal internal market in 2009') was produced<a href="#defann_31_5" name="refann_31_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. In addition, an Impact Assessment that accompanies the proposal for an amending Directive has been provided along with a more detailed Annex.</p>
<p>All these documents confirm that postal reform is well under way and assess that full market opening is feasible in all Member States in 2009. The available information and analysis suggests that in order to sustain the progress and results achieved to date, and to secure further improvements together with sustainable employment, the final step in the gradual process of market opening started a decade ago by Directive 97/67/EC should be taken. Employment aspects have been thoroughly examined and are set out in detail in the documents mentioned above. It should be noted that employment prospects are being influenced by a series of factors: these factors include, in particular, demand and changing customer needs, electronic substitution, new technologies and automation as well as organisational change. Positive effects of market opening on employment such as the creation of employment opportunities by new entrants and in adjacent sectors should also be borne in mind.</p>
<p>As far as financing instruments for possible net costs of the universal service are concerned, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the relevant provisions of the above proposed Directive and to its Article 7 in particular. The financing instruments – which include for example state aids, public procurement, compensation funds and cost sharing - have all been carefully considered. Without prejudice to the application of the EC competition rules, they may be applied by Member States should a need for financing net costs of universal service arise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As far as EU's competence is concerned, a distinction should be drawn between nuclear safety, which concerns measures taken to limit the risk of accidents in the operation of nuclear installations, and Euratom safeguards - a system designed to ensure that civil nuclear materials are not diverted from the civil uses for which they are intended.</p>
<p>1. Nuclear safety</p>
<p>Despite the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 10 December 2002 in the C-29/99 case recognizing the competences of the European Atomic Energy Community to legislate in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, the lack of a qualified majority in the Council made it impossible to proceed with the so called "nuclear package"<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which defined Community basic obligations and general principles in the field of the safety of the nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>2. Euratom safeguards</p>
<p>The Commission has investigated the implications of the incident at Thorp for the control of nuclear safeguards, according to its competence under the Euratom Treaty. After the investigation, the Commission has addressed a Decision based upon the provisions of Article 83 of the Euratom Treaty to the operator of the Sellafield site, British Nuclear Group, in February 2006. The Decision provides a formal warning to the operator and asks for the implementation of a set of measures aiming to improve safeguards control at the site.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the meeting organised together with the International Civil Aviation Organisation and Eurocontrol referred to in the question of the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that both Cyprus and Turkey have an interest to seek practical cooperation in the field of air safety management, notwithstanding the absence of political agreement on wider issues.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to encourage both Turkey and Cyprus to seek a mutually acceptable solution on the issue of air traffic management. The Commission raises the need for co-operation on air safety at various occasions in all relevant contexts with the Turkish authorities, including Eurocontrol. The Commission in its 2006 Progress Report on Turkey's Accession to the EU reiterated the lack of progress on all aspects relating to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and Cyprus. In line with the Negotiating Framework and the EU declaration of 21 September 2005, this issue will be evaluated by the EU before the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue to encourage Turkey to negotiate an air transport agreement with the Community, and stress the importance of creating a European Common Aviation Area that can operate smoothly and efficiently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0909"></a>

<p>Since 2003 the implementation of CAP reforms, and particularly the sharp reductions by the Commission of the dairy market support budgets beyond the initial CAP Reform plans, have contributed to price reductions of around 20% for Irish dairy farmers. Combined with high production cost inflation, this has created unprecedented pressure on dairy farm family incomes, not only in Ireland but across the EU.</p>
<p>In this context of a very real dairy income crisis for European dairy farms, how confident is the Commission that enough dairy farmers will continue to generate adequate incomes to justify remaining in production, and secure sufficient milk supplies to meet the needs of EU consumers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In 2003, before the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the average annual farm gate milk price for Irish farmers was 28.7 cent/litre. This price remained stable in 2004 and 2005. The first nine months of 2006 show a price which is only 1.5 cent/litre below the 2003 level. In 2006, Irish farmers will receive a compensation of 3.5 cent/litre of milk. This means a net gain of 2 cents/litre or an increase of 7%.</p>
<p>The current internal market situation is very favourable. Prices of skimmed milk powder are higher than before the reform. Prices of cheese are stable since the start of the reform. Currently, prices for whole milk powder, casein and butter are increasing. This should have a positive effect on farm gate prices.</p>
<p>The Commission does not see a real income crisis in dairying as yet. Not in Ireland and not in most other Member States.</p>

The failure since 1982 to carry out a reliable census of the populations of the Tindouf camps along internationally recognised lines, which would give precise demographic data on the number of people in the camps and their origins, is preventing the competent international bodies from quantifying the real humanitarian assistance needs of the people in question.

<p>(EN) In an increasingly integrated and enlarged European Union, non-resident drivers make up more and more of the traffic flow, and some of them flout traffic laws when travelling abroad, without fear of being prosecuted in their country of residence.</p>
<p>In its Recommendation of 21 October 2003 on enforcement in the field of road safety<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission recommended putting in place a mechanism for cross-border enforcement of infringements of road traffic regulations. Its aim was to ensure that, at least for serious and repeated violations, traffic offences are reported to the competent authority of the Member State in which the vehicle is registered, via enforcement co-ordination points that Member States were asked to set up.</p>
<p>As the enforcement of traffic law is one of the most effective ways to reduce road casualties in Europe, the Commission committed itself to propose measures of a more binding nature to achieve the objective of reducing the annual number of road deaths in the EU by 20.000 fatalities (50%) in the year 2010, if measures taken would prove insufficient to attain that target.</p>
<p>Since it appears now that this objective will indeed not be achieved if the current trend (minus 35%) continues, the Commission has put on its Work Programme for 2007 to come up with legislation to this end. Such legislation should ensure that the enforcement of road traffic laws is applied equally to all citizens irrespective of their nationality or residence in the European Union. It would need to contain rules and electronic mechanisms, for instance to enable access to vehicle registration databases throughout the European Union. In addition, there would need to be cooperation between enforcement authorities from the different Member States on a structural basis.</p>
<p>The Commission launched an impact assessment study on road safety enforcement and cross-border cooperation and will shortly publish the consultation paper in this field.</p>
<p>Finally it should be noted that the 24 February 2005 Council Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> gives Member States the power to enforce financial penalties on drivers who have committed a road traffic offence somewhere in the European Union.

<p>Support by industry and other stakeholders in the framework of the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) should significantly accelerate the rate at which alternatives are agreed, validated and put into practice. This partnership is an unprecedented collaboration between the Commission and major companies from seven industry sectors. The partners have committed to pooling knowledge, research and resources to accelerate the development, validation and acceptance of alternative approaches over an initial five-year period. An action programme to promote change has been agreed and progress against this will be regularly published<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The ECVAM of the Joint Research Centre, Institute for Health and Consumer Protection, will continue to play a crucial role in steering the efforts to make alternative methods available. In FP7, the work of ECVAM will be supported by a similar workforce and expertise as in FP6, complemented by a group of scientists from another JRC-IHCP Unit (European Chemicals Bureau) pursuing developments in validation methods such as those in the category of 'in silico' (QSAR<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>). Laboratory activities are planned to be integrated within ECVAM in order to speed up the validation of alternative testing methods (especially for the 'me-too' tests).</p>
<p>Alternative methods are identified as a specific topic in the Cooperation Specific Programme of FP7. The work programme for the first call contains a series of topics to promote alternative testing. Proposals addressing these topics are evaluated by peer review following published criteria. The total amount of funding for alternative testing projects depends therefore on the quality of the proposals submitted.</p>
<p>All this builds on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, communicated to Council and the Parliament in January 2006. One of the Action Plan's objectives is to "Provide greater coordination of existing resources while identifying future needs; Support future trends in animal welfare research and continue to support the 3Rs principle: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement alternative approaches to animal testing".</p>
<p>The Commission restates its previous commitment that validation must not become the bottle-neck for the availability of alternative methods and will give it the necessary priority.</p>

In 1990, the 1962 Recommendation was replaced by Commission Recommendation 90/326/EEC<a href="#defann_42_4" name="refann_42_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> of 22 May 1990 to the Member States concerning the adoption of a European schedule of occupational diseases.

<p>The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the fact that the memoranda referred to in the question have subsequently taken the form of a document called 'Information notices on diagnosis of occupational diseases' completed in 1994 and published as a separate report by the Commission. This report was published in English and French. The report is available from the Office of Publications of the European Communities in Luxembourg (see http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/docs_en.htm</p>
<p> for reference).</p>
<p>As this report is available from the Office of Publications, no specific action has been taken to send copies to the stakeholders concerned. However, copies are made available on an ad hoc basis, inter alia, on the occasion of relevant meetings organised by the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally, the report 'Information notices on diagnosis of occupational diseases' is currently undergoing revision. A specific experts group has been set up in late 2004 to check, revise and update its content in the light of the latest technical and scientific progress in the field. On that basis, a new version of the report will be published in the course of 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Commission has proposed a reform of the wine sector with the aim of contributing towards achieving the Lisbon strategy and ensuring the competitiveness of wine producers in the enlarged EU. With this in mind, production should react to the needs of the European and world markets. While sectoral reform is welcome, why does the Commission propose the grubbing-up of vineyards in return for financial compensation instead of a more effective system of restructuring vineyards and stepping up wine-growing and wine-making marketing and information activities? Furthermore, why does the Commission propose the introduction of a harmful ban on the use of sucrose for enrichment of wine, and why does the reform proposed by the Commission fail to pay greater attention to climatic conditions and traditions in individual EU Member States? Does not the Commission consider that the two measures mentioned above might harm the diversity and unique character of wine-growing and wine-making in the EU, which might ultimately lead to an even greater reduction in competitiveness?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is grateful to the Honourable Member for putting down this question because it gives it an opportunity to update the house.</p>
<p>Grubbing-up: The Commission knows that grubbing-up is a controversial matter but it needs to look at it from a more social angle. The Commission will not be able to maintain status quo in the wine sector. Some wine producers will have to leave the sector because they will not be able to face competition. The question is should the Commission give the wine producer the possibility of an arranged exit from the sector or should the Commission do nothing? The Commission does not believe that the best option is to do nothing. The areas which have been grubbed up will be transferred into the single farm payment scheme which would mean that new requirements will avoid environmental damage after grubbing-up. Grubbing-up should not be seen in isolation but in combination with the abolition of market management measures and the establishment of national envelopes to finance more forward looking measures. This is to enable European producers to gain competitiveness and (re)conquer those market shares currently gained by new world producers.</p>
<p>Promotion: The Commission repeats its commitment to consider new opportunities for the promotion of responsible wine consumption. In addition, simpler and more transparent quality classes, via the more World Trade Organisation compatible geographic indications system and labelling rules can help to promote and market European wines. The Commission hopes to accomplish this with the help from the wine sector. However, the current Commission Regulations on the provision of information and the promotion of wine are not fully used.</p>
<p>Chaptalisation: In the Commission's Communication on a sustainable European wine sector, everything has been put on the table since it is important to have an in-depth discussion of all elements of the current common market organisation in wine. The Commission has indeed taken into account the climatic differences in the Community by encouraging the use of grape sugar rather than beet sugar to enhance the alcohol content of wine in certain cases. This is completely consistent with the Community and international definition of wine: "…a product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes…". The excessive "chaptalisation" to increase the alcohol content of wine using beet sugar is even recognised by the profession.</p>
<p>The Commission will endeavour to ensure that EU vineyards and wines with a unique character, recognised by the market, are maintained. As the Commissioner in charge of Agriculture has said on numerous occasions she is looking, listening and learning in many regions of the Community. All of the issues raised by the Honourable Member are and will continue to be examined by the Commission in the coming months while it awaits the opinion of this institution before completing its legislative proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0927"></a>

<p>(EN) The emphasis since the 2005 mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs has been on establishing a partnership approach, combining action at national level (National Reform Programmes) with supporting measures at Community level (Community Lisbon programme).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently in the process of analysing the national progress reports submitted by Member States, outlining progress made since last year on their respective National Reform Programmes. This analysis will feed-into the Annual Lisbon Progress report, which the Commission foresees for adoption in December 2006. As it was the case in 2005, the Annual Progress Report will include a global assessment of EU progress towards the Lisbon objectives and targets, as well as individual country chapters analysing the situation in each Member State. This analysis takes account of progress made, inter alia, on a number of indicators relevant to competitiveness such as the share of R&amp;D<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in GDP<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the employment rate (illustrating two key priorities of the Lisbon Strategy).</p>
<p>Concerning the promotion of benchmarking, the emphasis in the Lisbon process has moved from benchmarking in the sense of creating 'league tables' to assessing progress in relation to Member States' own starting points and conditions. Since 2005, the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs has put priority also on the national ownership of the reform process. Besides, the Commission promotes the exchange of best policies between Member States, whereby they can learn from each others' experiences.</p>
<p>The Commission remains much committed to actively lead and support the relaunched Lisbon Strategy by fostering joint ownership with Member States and main stakeholders, both in its analysis (through key underpinning analytical reports such as the EU Economic Review 2006, or the Competitiveness Report 2006) and in its benchmarking exercise and policy recommendations through its Annual Progress Report 2006 (due for adoption on 12 December 2006).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member asked how much does industry gain from EU legislation in the way of income and profits.</p>
<p>The benefits of EU legislation cannot be fully quantified yet the available evidence suggests that they are very significant. For example, the effects of the internal market programme have been estimated to at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Other studies put the effect of economic integration between EU-15 Member States at some 10% of GDP. A recent study on "EU accession and income growth"<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> indicates that the net benefits for the new Member States after EU membership may be as high as a 39% increase in total income and a 56% increase in overall trade. An analysis of previous enlargements produced similar data. Spain increased its production per capita from 74%, of the EU average, in 1986 to 84% in 2001, and Portugal increased it from 62% to 75% in the same period.</p>
<p>Regulation can burden businesses either by imposing heavy compliance costs or by requesting information in relation to the compliance with legislation. The latter are called administrative burdens. This distinction is important because the reduction of administrative burdens does not interfere in any way with the substance underlying the piece of legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes a 25% reduction target in administrative burdens, in the entire European Union covering both European and national legislation. This is essentially a particular form of simplification aimed at information requirements both at Community and Member States levels that does not as such affect the underlying legislation. Recent simulations show that reaching this target would generate economic benefits of the order of 1.1 to 1.5% of GDP or around € 150 billion in the medium term<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the burden associated with administrative reporting requirements has to be put into context. Firstly, these requirements have their origin in regional, national and EU level legislation. Therefore, it would be wrong to assume that if no reporting obligations emanated from the EU level, the figure would automatically be considerably lower. According to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU only acts where there is an added value to decisions being taken at the national level. It would be fair to assume that in the absence of regulation at EU level, there would exist, in most instances, a corresponding legislation at national level that would equally result in costs for the European economy. It is very likely that a situation in which 25 countries acted individually would actually lead to higher administrative burdens for businesses operating in the internal market. Finally, some of these legal obligations or reporting requirements are inevitable since they are needed in order to monitor compliance with consumer, health and environmental protection or meant to protect the Community's financial management.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Thus mutual recognition is facilitated by a standard European model outlined in the annex to this Council recommendation covering the practical dispositions of the card.

However, the Commission has itself acknowledged two major flaws in this approach: that some countries remain outside the system – such as Russia, which a recent investigation has revealed to be a major source of illegal timber on the EU market; and that circumvention is entirely possible – as is being witnessed with, for example, products made using illegal Russian timber being exported from China.</p>
<p>Does the Commission acknowledge the undermining effect these problems will have on the effectiveness of the Action Plan, and how does it propose to address them? How are the recommendations of the European Parliament Resolution of July 2005 being reflected in the Plan's implementation?

<p>(EN) The Commission acknowledged in its Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) that bilateral FLEGT Partnerships can not address the problem of circumvention through third countries or the non-participation of certain countries. The Commission intends to conduct an impact assessment on several options it has identified to improve the effectiveness of the FLEGT initiative, including further legislation. A series of meetings, both formal and informal, have been hosted by the Commission for various stakeholders and other interested parties, both from the EU as well as from non-EU countries. On the basis of the outcome of this exercise, the Commission will take a decision on whether public consultation need to be undertaken or further proposals.</p>
<p>The Commission concurs in general with the recommendations concerning improvement of governance and participation in the FLEGT Partnership negotiations. As regards the recommendations of the Parliament Resolution of July 2005 concerning the legal basis the Commission would like to state that it will only propose a legal base of any future Voluntary Partnership Agreements, once the text of any such specific agreement is finalised. In terms of financial assistance, the Commission anticipates that some funds will be set aside within the future Environment and Natural Resources Thematic Programme, as well as in the main "geographic" funds within the Development Cooperation Instrument and the European Development Fund.</p>
<p>The Commission will keep the Parliament informed of the state of FLEGT negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0948"></a>

<p>One of the EU's fundamental principles is to guarantee a level playing field so that everyone can compete in the market on an equal basis. At the moment, however, certain Member States are at a disadvantage on account of restrictions concerning the free flow of persons or the Schengen area. Most of the countries concerned have a level of development below the EU average, and such barriers are just one more obstacle to faster development.</p>

<p>(EN) According to the Treaty of Accession, Member States have the right to apply certain restrictions regarding access to the labour market for workers from all of the 10 Member States that joined on 1 May 2004, except for workers from Cyprus and Malta. The transitional arrangements are divided into three distinct phases, according to the "2-plus-3-plus-2" formula for the period of seven years, different conditions apply during each of these phases.</p>
<p>In a report to the Council on the first phase of the transitional arrangements (1 May 2004 – 30 April 2006), the Commission concluded that there was no threat of negative impact of free movement of workers and that those Member States that had opened their labour markets were able to harness the positive effects of that decision. It urged Member States, when preparing the notification of their intentions for the second phase (1 May 2006 – 30 April 2009), to take due account of the statistical evidence and the conclusions contained in the Commission report.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the decision of a significant number of Member States that have lifted restrictions in the second phase: in addition to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden which had already fully opened their markets during the first phase also Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland decided to open their labour markets from 1 May 2004, and Italy from 21 July 2006. Together with the decisions of other Member States (Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands) to allow easier access to certain sectors/professions through simplified procedures, it shows that most EU-15 Member States agree that the 2004 enlargement has had largely beneficial effects for the EU as a whole.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement within the Schengen area is concerned, it should be noted that the internal border control on persons between the Member States applying the Schengen acquis in full and the Member States which joined the EU in May 2004 are still in place, therefore persons crossing these borders are still submitted to border checks. However, it should be underlined that all EU-citizens have the right to cross these borders on the simple presentation of a valid passport or identity card.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0951"></a>

<p>(FR) The Complaints Board<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a jurisdictional body that is independent of the European Schools’ Board of Governors. Its members are chosen from a list drawn up for the purpose by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, and candidates are completely independent and noted for their legal expertise.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot concur with the honourable Member’s assertion that all decisions handed down to date by the Complaints Board are inadmissible on the grounds of the Board’s lack of jurisdiction. It has dealt with 35 complaints in 2005 and 2006, of which only nine have been rejected due to lack of jurisdiction. In 11 of the cases, the Board took a substantive decision. The other cases are either inadmissible on procedural grounds or pending. It therefore appears from these figures that the Board gives a substantive ruling wherever possible.</p>
<p>It is inaccurate to say that Complaints Board adjudicators have never met and that the decisions taken to date have been adopted on the basis of informal procedures. The Complaints Board operates in accordance with the rules laid down by Chapter IV of its Statute and regularly meets in public hearings, announced on the European Schools website<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, at its Brussels headquarters. Furthermore, it is the prerogative of the Chairman of the Board to use the resources he sees fit to communicate with the other Members outside the sessions held in Brussels.</p>
<p>In the Board of Governors, the Commission stated its opposition to extending the Complaints Board’s jurisdiction to all cases that may arise in the European Schools system. The Commission in fact notes that the signatories to the Convention defining the statute of the European schools did not want to grant the European Schools complete immunity from legal process. An extension of immunity from legal process to issues other than those currently covered can only come from a change to the Convention itself or from an additional agreement between the signatories. It cannot come from a unilateral act agreed upon by the Board of Governors. Furthermore, the Board of Governors and the administration and financial committee have indicated that granting general powers to the Complaints Board would have far-reaching consequences in terms of its structure and its modus operandi, leading to costs on which it is hard to put a figure, but probably comparable with those of the Court of First instance.</p>
<p>To answer the honourable Member’s last question, the Commission would note that the European Schools system is under no circumstances exempt from upholding the principle of legality, given that all cases not falling under the Complaints Board’s competence fall under national jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It should be specified that issues relating to discipline are subject to a procedure that is clearly set out in Article 44 of the general rules of the European Schools, which places great emphasis on the right to defence and any exclusion from the school of more than two weeks can be referred administratively to the Secretary-General of the European Schools and, where applicable, to the Complaints Board. On the other hand, any cases concerning the enrolment of pupils, which is currently the sole responsibility of each adjudicator<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, under Article 46 of the General Rules of the European Schools do not fall under the competence of the Complaints Board but should be brought before the national courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission gives a prominent role to the agri-environmental measures which support the sustainable development of rural areas and respond to society's increasing demand for environmental services. Council Regulation (EC) n° 1257/1999<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides for the means to encourage european farmers to serve society as a whole by continuing the use of environmental friendly practices in order to protect and improve the environment, natural resources, soil and genetic diversity and to maintain the landscape and countryside. Under Council Regulation (EC) n° 1698/2005<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, measures aiming at improving the environment and the countryside, among which are agri-environmental measures, will continue to play a prominent role in the programming period 2007-2013, with at least 25% of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) total contribution. Also the fact that the agri-environmental measures are, and will continue to be, the sole compulsory measures for the Member States within this policy show the highest priority the Commission attribute to them.</p>
<p>The rural development programmes approved by the Commission create the legal framework and provide for the necessary EU budgetary resources for concrete measures in order to achieve the overall EU environment and rural development objectives. Annually, the Commission decides the EU overall allocation for each Member State. The Member States are responsible for assigning this annual amount to each measure of their programmes taking into account their specific needs. As far as the agri-environmental measures are concerned, for example, the Member States have the possibility to amend the measures' allocation and/or content throughout the implementation period of the programmes in order to achieve a better uptake. Any discrepancy between the estimates done by the Member States and the actual implementation is the sole responsibility of the Member States and the Commission has no means to prevent their non-payment. Obviously, we are all eager to see that the results of these programmes are the best possible and it is always regrettable when some measures can not be financed in a Member State, hindering the full performance of the specific programmes.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is not possible to indicate the EU average for non-implementation of the agri-environment measures in 2004 and 2005. However, the Commission can inform you that in the EU15 a total of €3.937,257 million of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee section, were spent during those two years. Of this amount, €161,451 million were spent by Portugal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
