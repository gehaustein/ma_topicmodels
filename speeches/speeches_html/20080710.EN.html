I can of course confirm the Commission’s position on this, as outlined on Monday by Commissioner Špidla, who specifically referred to the letter that I sent to the Italian authorities on 3 July. During this debate, Mr Schulz expressed the view that I should inform the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition – since Mr Deprez is here, I can say this before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – I kept the Bureau and coordinators informed. Yesterday, Madam President, if I have understood correctly, the Conference of Presidents wanted me to make a brief statement to update Parliament on the latest news. I will briefly go over the measures taken by the Commission, which is of course extremely vigilant when it comes to these matters. I met with Mr Ronchi on 26 May. On 3 July I asked the Italian Government to explain the purpose and proportionality of the measures. We had an initial meeting with Mr Maroni in Cannes, during the Informal Council. Mr Maroni is the Italian Minister of the Interior.</p>
<p class="contents">During this meeting, Mr Maroni explained that the census would be used to check on entitlements to welfare benefits for the inhabitants of the nomad camps. He explained that fingerprints would be taken only if it was impossible to establish identity by other means, and that children would be fingerprinted only with a court order.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Uproar)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am merely repeating what the Minister said. I will tell you in a minute what I did. He said that he had asked to abolish any census on the basis of religion or ethnicity, and that the Italian Government, in cooperation with Unicef, had launched an action plan for the education of minors. Nevertheless, I have to say that the Italian Government has agreed to send us a status report on the situation by the end of July, which is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">After this informal meeting, I asked the Director-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Jonathan Faull, to write to the Italian authorities to obtain written confirmation of this information and to ask for additional clarification ahead of the report expected at the end of July. A letter was sent on 9 July. Late yesterday evening my staff in Brussels received a preliminary response. This document provides clarification on the identification of ethnicity and religion.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other aspects, I am unable to say at this point whether these will fully answer the questions asked by the Commission. It is our intention to obtain all the necessary information about the fingerprinting process. What is the purpose of fingerprinting and how will fingerprints be processed? What is the legal basis authorising this kind of processing of personal data? Will this data be kept? How will it be kept? Can it be used for other purposes? Are the people who are fingerprinted given preliminary information in writing?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as children are concerned, we requested confirmation of reports that under-14s would be fingerprinted only if this was authorised by a judge, for the purpose of establishing their identity.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also asked about the situation in the 17 regions of Italy that are not affected by the emergency decree.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have asked for texts, measures, decisions and legislative, regulatory or administrative acts to be sent that will give us an idea of the situation. It is up to you to decide whether we intend to follow up this issue with all the required vigilance and of course whether we enter into the necessary dialogue with the Italian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, the Commission wants this matter to be handled transparently and with respect for fundamental rights and Community law. Our role is to act as the guardian of the Treaties, verifying objectively, once we are in possession of all the relevant information, that Italy has correctly applied the Community law applicable in these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, as Commissioner Špidla explained, I am convinced – and I said as much to the Italian Government – that it is necessary to find effective solutions tailored to the problems faced in particular by the Roma, especially Roma children, who are the primary victims of the situation of poverty and exclusion. The Roma must be helped and not stigmatised; this is why, in the report that it presented last week, the Commission emphasised that the European Union, the Member States and civil society must join forces to effectively coordinate their efforts to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are issues and political views that divide us, but there are also things that unite us in this Parliament, and these include a commitment to human rights, the fight against all forms of racism, so we should not allow ourselves to become divided on those topics where we are in agreement because, otherwise, we shall weaken the very issue that unites us. Our competent Commissioner Jacques Barrot has explained that there continue to be some unanswered questions when it comes to assessing the facts about the problems we may have in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are referring mainly to articles in the press, and we are referring to a wide variety of forms that have been sent around Parliament over recent weeks. Therefore we, the PPE-DE Group, move that today’s vote on the resolution be postponed until the September part-session because, by then, the facts will have been clarified and we shall know what we are voting on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to all the Members who disagree with this that, as long as you are not out to get a quick headline, but instead have the objectives of cooperating to achieve something for the minorities in Europe, and of all groups in this Parliament, both large and small, pulling together, then jointly we can achieve something for these people. Those who just want a quick headline, just want to get publicity, should vote now. We advocate postponing it until we know the facts of the matter. I have to acknowledge that the debate we have had over the last few days has exerted enough pressure to get the matter moving. I would ask those who want proper answers to support the motion for us to discuss this in September.</p>

Commissioner Barrot has reported in a very factual but conclusive way that, for one thing, the Italian Government has passed on information that was very incomplete and, it seems to me, not particularly relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all familiar with this form. It is a form of the type normally used to record crimes, a form that clearly shows that the Italian Government is taking measures that would be suited to criminal investigations, at the most, but which most definitely do not serve the protection of children. Judging by what Mr Barrot has just told us, it is more imperative than ever to adopt this resolution today, to send out a clear signal from the European Parliament.</p>

I assure you that thousands of minors are living in conditions of total neglect, with no right to medical treatment, vaccinations or schooling.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the Commission and the Italian Government are working together… – Mr President, may I finish speaking? May I continue or must I stop speaking? Would you please remind the House that I have the right to speak? – I was saying that the Commission and the Government are going in the right direction and in particular I believe that we should not vote on a resolution that is full of inaccuracies, actual errors from a legal point of view, i.e. full of legal falsehoods. It is therefore an entirely political resolution, with no basis in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, I would like to remind the House – and I am reaching my conclusion – that, while Commissioner Barrot has been extremely clear today, three days ago Commissioner Špidla said that he had yet to read the act, which I believe consists of no more than two pages. Therefore if those on the left must at all costs make a premature judgment on a government’s methods, I believe it to be entirely illegitimate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The countries of South-East Europe have definite prospects of joining the EU in the next decade, but truth and clarity also require an acknowledgment that pushing ahead with the accession of Turkey would undermine the EU.

One of the main challenges facing the EU fisheries sector remains, in many cases, the structural imbalance between fleet capacity and the resources available. The overcapacity of the EU fleet was estimated a few years ago at around 40%. This overcapacity, combined with the depletion of fishing stocks by decades of overfishing, means that the sector is struggling to withstand external economic pressures such as the sudden rise in fuel prices. I wish that a Community instrument annualising the increase in oil prices had been envisaged so that the internal market had time to react to rising cost prices. I welcome the actions of the French Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, Michel Barnier, who worked hard to achieve this result.

Nevertheless, such rights and responsibilities should comply with the EU fundamental principles of non-discrimination, as well as respect for fundamental freedoms and human dignity. The rights of minors, regardless of their ethnical membership, should be ensured with priority. This approach has been used in Romania and should be expanded to the situation in the other Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, taking into consideration the cultural particularities of the Roma people, the solution for its integration should be found at European level by drafting a coherent and comprehensive strategy.

Let us be clear on this: I am of course in favour of the ban on fingerprinting the Roma population, including minors, and using the fingerprints collected, since this would clearly constitute an act of direct discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, prohibited by Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and would also represent an act of discrimination. Nevertheless, I was swayed by the arguments of the Vice-President of the European Commission, my friend Jacques Barrot, since he clearly said that the Commission was closely watching the situation with complete transparency to ensure that Community law was enforced. In all good conscience, I have decided that we should wait for the various responses expected from the Italian Government before taking political initiatives such as the resolution adopted, which could be open to misinterpretation by European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The measure under discussion in our Government, despite Minister Maroni’s ambiguous reassurances, should be reduced to the bare essentials: the problem with this measure is not identification in itself, but the fact that it aims to use an ethnic criterion and a highly discriminatory practice (fingerprinting), especially in relation to minors. We are not alone in highlighting these abuses: there have been loud protests from large parts of the Catholic Church, and both lay and Catholic voluntary associations and organisations. The national President of Unicef has also firmly rejected the substance of this decree.

The plans proposed for the new enlargement aim at greater exploitation and manipulation of the peoples of the accession countries, which are already in a dire situation, and a further escalation in the pillage of those countries by European capital. In particular, the process of enlargement to the Western Balkans is accompanied by a huge operation of subjugating and humiliating the peoples of those countries. A typical example is the insistence on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the pseudo-court that was set up by the American and European imperialist bullies to try the victims of their wars and crimes in the area, and that was used to destroy the former President, Slobodan Milošević. The peoples are also particularly at risk from the fact that the enlargement process continues to rely on a change of borders and the creation of protectorates for the imperialists, such as the protectorate of Kosovo, which will lead to a new cycle of imperialist antagonisms and clashes, with the peoples of the area as the victims.</p>

There can be no dispute that the presidential elections in Zimbabwe were illegitimate, and the violence, murders, arrests and harassment of the opposition within the country are a particularly savage aspect of the absence of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">As the resolution states, Zimbabwe very much needs a mediation process which includes various parties from the international community and Africa. The parties to the dialogue must achieve sustainable outcomes for Zimbabwe and this will be possible only if the whole international community and its extensive democratic powers take part. The people of Zimbabwe have a deep-seated longing for democracy.</p>

By contrast, South Africa’s political and economic support for Mugabe’s rule and the expulsion of Zimbabwean refugees from South Africa are contrary to our shared values.

Not only can they find themselves in physical danger there but they can also add to the instability of the situation and pressure on diminishing resources.

This is the conclusion of the report adopted by the European Parliament on space and the security of the EU. The report underlines the necessity of using space for ‘EU Member States’ deployments under UN, NATO and other similar organisations. It calls for rapid development of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes, full development of the EU Satellite Centre, and the coordination, through the European Space Agency, of the satellite communication systems of the EU Member States, for the purposes of espionage and surveillance, in order to provide ‘independent, reliable and complete information in support of its policies for conflict prevention policies, crisis management operations …’</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget is already allocating an astronomical EUR 5.25 billion for these purposes, for the period 2007-2013 alone. This fact, as well as the decision to speed up the Galileo programme, shows that the EU intends to integrate the use of space into the strategic resources and capabilities for promoting the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Security and Defence Policy – in other words, the mechanism for the EU’s imperialist interventions around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all this, the report’s appeal for ‘non-militarisation’ of space – typical proof of the outrageous duplicity of imperialist political mouthpieces – is the utmost hypocrisy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Sarkozy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to address your Assembly at such a critical moment for Europe. I am well aware that we all bear a heavy responsibility. Of course, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have a great responsibility, but the responsibility of all pro-Europeans is the same.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we get Europe out of the crisis in which it finds itself? How do we prevent immobility? How do we overcome our disagreements and use them to serve the same European ideal? Here we stand at the heart of European democracy. Each one of you, having the honour of sitting in this Parliament, has had to win the support of your compatriots. There are men and women of the left, of the centre, of the right; there are elected representatives from 27 countries. However, today we must turn our differences into a strength for an ailing European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make these differences an opportunity to reassure European citizens, who are worried. We must keep democracy alive, which means that we must engage in debate and at the same time create an image of a Europe that rejects immobility. Everyone must be on board in the European family, with its 27 Member States; nobody must be left behind. We are just a few months away from an important date for the European Parliament. It is reasonable for everyone to be conscious of this. At the same time, we must give the impression this morning of a Europe that is working for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen easier situations than the one in which Europe now finds itself. If I may speak freely, conscious that, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must speak on everyone’s behalf, I have to take account of everyone’s sensibilities and at the same time come up with the right answers.</p>
<p class="contents">First observation: we have an institutional problem. Heads of State or Government have tried to find a compromise with the Lisbon Treaty. No one said that the Lisbon Treaty was going to solve all of our problems, but it was and remains the expression of a compromise acceptable to everyone. I myself, as President of the French Republic, had to face up to my responsibilities. France voted ‘no’ in 2005 and this caused a problem for France. Ladies and gentlemen, the issues that we have to address are very difficult and complex; let us try to give everyone the idea that we are working on this with no ulterior motives and no preconceptions. That is what is expected of us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Before the elections, I offered the French people parliamentary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. Before the elections, I said that I would not hold a referendum in France. I said this to the people of France in a democratic spirit; it was a choice I made three days before I was elected, which could have been highly significant. I do not regret that choice. I truly believe that institutional issues, the way in which we do things in Europe, are something for members of parliament rather than for referendums. It is a political choice that I am making <span class="italic">(applause) </span>and it is a political choice that I made in my own country before the elections. Therefore, it is perfectly democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the problem of the Irish ‘no’ vote. It is certainly not for a Frenchman to pass judgment on this outcome considering the earlier Dutch and French ‘no’ votes. Therefore, on 21 July, for the first time as President-in-Office of the Council, I will go to Ireland to listen, engage in dialogue and try to find solutions. The French Presidency will propose a method and, I hope, a solution in agreement with the Irish Government, either in October or December.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is this: we must avoid both rushing our Irish friends and yet at the same time establish under what conditions and with what treaty we are going to organise the 2009 European elections. We therefore have a bit of time, but not that much. We owe it to our fellow citizens to know on what basis we are going to organise the European elections. The basis will be either the Lisbon Treaty or the Nice Treaty. There will not be a new institutional conference. There will not be a new treaty. It is either Lisbon or Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">May I add, just to be perfectly clear – it is my opinion, but that does not make it the truth – that I am one of those who have always supported European enlargement. The 2004 enlargement was a success. The family is back together; we should not regret that. However, I am one of those who have always wished that Europe had been wise enough to create new institutions before enlargement. That was a mistake and we are paying for it today. It would have been braver to establish institutions before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to be perfectly clear on this. Of course I do not regret enlargement. The family must stay together. However, I am adamant, President Pöttering, that we must not make the same mistakes again. If we stick with Nice, it is the Europe of 27. If we want enlargement – and personally I do – we need new institutions before enlarging. Who would have thought that Europe, with its 27 Member States, would be incapable of establishing its own institutions and that it would have no other priority than to keep on enlarging? Things have to be clear: if we want enlargement – and we do want enlargement – then we need new institutions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me add – and I am saying this to Mr Schulz – that I am in favour of bringing in the Balkans, that our Croatian friends, like our Serbian friends, are unquestionably European. However, the most pro-enlargement countries cannot say, ‘we do not want Lisbon’, yet at the same time, ‘we want enlargement’. It is Lisbon and enlargement. It is not blackmail, because in Europe, we do not do blackmail. It is a matter of consistency, honesty and logic. When it comes to Croatia, therefore, we must continue the negotiations, but everyone must shoulder their responsibilities. If Europe is to grow, and it must, then it must do so with new institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: here and there in European debates I come across people saying, ‘well look, it does not matter if we have a multi-speed Europe.’ Perhaps one day we will unfortunately have to have a multi-speed Europe, but that can only be a last resort. Europe has paid dearly for being divided by a wall of shame. Europe has paid dearly for the dictatorship imposed on 80 million Europeans. Let us think hard before we leave anyone behind.</p>
<p class="contents">When we were negotiating the Lisbon Treaty in Brussels, France fought to ensure that Poland could take its place in the Lisbon Treaty. How can we tell 38 million Poles that it is much easier to shake off the yoke of the dictatorship that they were under, and from which they freed themselves, thanks to high-calibre people such as Lech Walesa and Jean-Paul II, than to remain in a free Europe? There are 27 members in this family. Nobody should be left behind. We must bring everybody in the European family on board; that, at least, is what the French Presidency will work towards.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Regarding other issues, and I believe that we can reach a consensus on them, nothing would be worse than for Europe to give the impression of being immobile because it is going through yet another an institutional drama. That would be an awful trap for us to fall into. We reject institutions that condemn us to immobility, but at the same time, Europeans are impatient because they think we are too immobile.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the institutional problem, perhaps even because of the institutional problem, Europe has a duty to act, and to act now. This is the message that the French Presidency would like us all to send to Europeans. We are in the process of resolving the institutional problems, but we are not condemned to inaction. What, then, are our priorities?</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to show Europeans that Europe can protect them. Now I would like to say something about this word ‘protection’. Since ancient times, whenever people have elected a government, it was so that this government would protect them. Mr President, Europe must offer protection without protectionism. Protectionism gets us nowhere. Seeing European citizens today think that Europe, which was designed to protect them, is a source of concern rather than protection, is a real step backwards. Therefore, it is up to us to show how Europe is going to protect them on concrete issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the energy and climate package. If there is one area in which our nations can do nothing if they act alone, it is in maintaining the ecological balance of our planet. When it comes to pollution, CO<span class="sub">2</span> and the ozone layer, the borders between our countries are irrelevant. The stakes are high: since the meeting of IPCC experts, we have realised that we are the last generation that can prevent disaster. The last generation! If we do not do anything now, future generations may be able to limit the damage, but they will not be able to stop it.</p>
<p class="contents">Every country in the world says: ‘I am willing to do something provided that the others start first.’ With this type of reasoning, our grandchildren’s grandchildren will never see any decisions made. If we Europeans wait for others to do something before we act, we could be waiting a long time. We created Europe to take our model of civilization to the world and to defend our values.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those values is the certainty that the world is doomed if we do not take a decision right away. Europe must set an example. Europe must lead by example. We have a goal: the 2009 conference. This conference must manage and organise the post-Kyoto phase. Europe must come to it united, having decided to adopt the energy and climate package. If we do not, we will not have any leverage to get the Chinese, Indians, emerging countries and Americans to make the efforts that we have agreed on. Therefore, it is essential that, under the French Presidency, we adopt the energy and climate package submitted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is a demanding package, it is a difficult package, but I would like to appeal to everyone’s sense of responsibility. If every country starts wanting to renegotiate its own particular bugbear, the things it has a problem with, then, ladies and gentlemen, we will never reach an agreement. This is why the French Presidency is asking the European Parliament to rally behind it so that we can get the energy and climate package adopted within the next six months. That is a priority. It is not a right-wing or a left-wing priority, it is simply common sense. If we go into negotiations Member State by Member State, we have no chance of succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, of course, there are points that need to be clarified or adapted. I am thinking in particular of a very difficult matter: namely the problems for our firms, on which we are rightly going to impose rules to maintain the balance of the planet. Should we, in Europe, impose essential rules on our firms and, at the same time, continue to import products from countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we impose on our businesses? That is not a matter of protectionism; it is a matter of fairness, justice and refusing to be naive. There is the problem of deciding on a border mechanism. Should there be free quotas or adjustment mechanisms? I do not know, but, in any case, we have to discuss it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Second question: I understand that, for some countries – I am thinking particularly of those that joined us in 2004, which largely rely on fossil fuels for their energy – the efforts demanded of them are considerable. These countries are telling us, ‘we have had growth for 10 years; please do not take that away from us.’ No doubt there is a way to get everyone on board and, with the President of the Commission, we have to work on it so that everyone realises that they will not be doomed to recession, misery, poverty and unemployment. This energy and climate package is an absolute priority for us. The world cannot wait; Europe has to lead the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: of the 27 countries, 24 are now in the Schengen Area; in other words, 24 countries out of 27. 23, you say? OK, 23 then, but that is still not bad. This does not include countries that are not members of the European Union but – and this is why we often have debates – are part of the Schengen Area. So what does this mean? It means that we have decided on complete freedom of movement between the Schengen Area countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the leaders of the political groups and to members of parliament that we in France, with Bernard Kouchner and Jean-Pierre Jouyet, have taken a decision that was not easy to take. Since 1 July, there have no longer been any barriers preventing access to the French labour market, because I have announced that I will abolish all of the restrictions negotiated by my predecessors. Any worker from any EU country can come and work in France.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was not that simple; it was not that easy. In any case, and French MEPs will correct me if I am wrong, I was told that it would be a disaster if I announced this decision. As usual, we made the decision, and no disaster materialised. I was not happy about the dispute over the infamous ‘Polish plumber’, which did not give my country or indeed Europe a very good name. That is not why we all built the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, now that we no longer have any borders between us, is it fair, is it reasonable for each of us to go on deciding our own immigration policy, taking no notice of the others’ constraints? The European Pact on Immigration and Asylum is an essential document for the French Presidency, for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these – and may I turn to the left of the Chamber first – is that if all of us, if all European countries have a European immigration policy, we remove immigration from national debates where extremists use poverty and fear to serve values that are not ours. The only way to have a responsible debate on immigration is to make it a European policy. No more partisan ulterior motives compelling countries with different sensitivities to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">What Brice Hortefeux suggested, which was approved by all ministers and should be discussed by the Permanent Representatives Committee and by the European Council, seems to me a priority. It will show that Europe does not want to be a fortress, that Europe is not refusing to take people in, that Europe needs migrant workers, but that Europe cannot take in everyone who would like to come to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that, when it comes to political asylum, it is not logical for one individual to be able to submit 27 applications to 27 democratic countries and not get the same answers every time to the same problem. Let me add that, for development with Africa, we will be stronger if we work together; this is the second priority of the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Third priority: we want to further a concept often talked about in Europe, but which is making slow progress, and that is European defence. I am well aware that there is a lot of disagreement surrounding this issue, but let me tell you what I believe. How do you think Europe can become a political power and make itself heard if it cannot defend itself and deploy resources in support of its policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of Kosovo, which to my mind is a European Union success story. This is a European problem, which has to be settled by Europeans. How can Europeans continue to do that if they do not acquire the military and human resources to enforce the decisions that we have taken together? How do you think that Europe can become the most prosperous economic area in the world if it is unable to defend itself?</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have NATO. It would not occur to anyone, least of all me, to dispute the usefulness of NATO. It is not a matter of choosing between a European defence policy or NATO, but of having NATO – the alliance with the Americans – and an autonomous European security policy. It is both of these together, not one instead of the other. Let me add that we cannot go on having Europe ensuring its security based on the contribution of just four or five countries, with the others relying on the efforts of these four or five countries. The Member States cannot keep on building their own aircraft separately, having armaments industries that compete with each other to the point of ruin and ultimately are weakened, simply because they are not strong enough to have a European defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth priority: the extremely difficult issue of the common agricultural policy. I am coming now to my conclusion, which is linked with this. It is precisely because it is difficult that we need to talk about it. I am perfectly aware that among us we have agricultural States that fiercely defend the work of their farmers and, at the same time, States that think that this policy costs too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, may I appeal to your common sense. In 2050 the world will have 9 billion inhabitants. Already, there 800 million people who are dying of starvation. A child starves to death every 30 seconds. Is it reasonable to ask Europe to reduce its agricultural production at a time when the world has such great need of foodstuffs? I do not think that this is reasonable. It is not about French agriculture; it is about common sense.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a second point: regardless of whether your country is an agricultural one, food security concerns everyone. Is it reasonable to impose, rightly, traceability and safety rules on our breeders and farmers and go on importing meat into Europe which comes from other countries that do not abide by any of the rules that we are imposing on our farmers?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Third point: agricultural prices have never been so high. It is precisely the right time to talk about prices, to talk about subsidies and to talk about Community preference. I also think that between the common agricultural policy’s health check and financial arbitration, we might be able to agree on certain concepts such as food sufficiency and food security for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is a host of other topics: the social dimension, for example, is a huge issue. May I make one point. Sometimes I see a certain contradiction: a single-minded view sometimes exists that Europe should not meddle with everything and that Europe should intervene only in areas that concern it. However, the same people who accuse Europe of poking its nose into everything are the first to speak up when we do not talk about the social dimension. Until now, the Member States have always wanted social policy to be first and foremost a national competence, because pensions and healthcare are primarily national issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of social directives that President Barroso did well to put on the agenda. I am thinking of those on works councils, temporary work and a number of basic rules which have to be imposed on everyone in Europe. The French Presidency will make this a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Other subjects too should be put on the French Presidency’s agenda, even though they are not within Europe’s remit. Let me take an example of something which affects us all: Alzheimer’s disease. <span class="italic">(Off-mike comment from Mr Cohn-Bendit: ‘not yet’).</span> Mr Cohn-Bendit, it would never have occurred to me that someone so young as you should already be affected by a disease which, although it does not affect you, affects millions of Europeans. These millions of Europeans are just as important to me as your health.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course, subsidiarity means that this is not a European competence. Nevertheless, I would like the French Presidency to organise a meeting of all specialists from all European countries so that we can share best practice, so that our researchers can pool their skills to find out more about this disease and so that together we can find a solution. Just imagine what Europeans would say about Europe then: it is a way of curing these awful diseases. What I said about Alzheimer’s could apply to cancer, which breaks families apart. There is no reason for everyone to work on their own on finding solutions to cancer when together we will have more resources and be stronger.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to culture and sport, let me say that it is a big mistake not to talk about the issues that affect the day-to-day lives of Europeans. There is a European cultural exception. We must make culture a part of everyday debate in Europe. The world does not have to bow down to one language and one culture. We must clearly address the question of VAT on videos and CDs, like that of VAT on books, which you have settled.</p>
<p class="contents">On sport, which transcends political divides, let me just say that I would like there to be a sporting exception in Europe, just as there is a cultural exception. I am in favour of the freedom of movement of individuals and goods, but I do not accept the idea that we should make our football clubs pay, undermining the investment that many clubs make in teenage boys, who need to stay with the club for training purposes. A sporting exception, which would mean that sport is not beholden to the market economy, should have the support of all MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to finish – apologies for having been too long, no doubt – with a final observation. I know where I am going to make this observation: where the heart of European democracy beats. Europe has suffered a great deal. It has suffered first of all from the cowardice of some of us, who were very happy to let Europe pay for responsibilities which were really those of political leaders, unwilling to make in public the choices that they refused to defend in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is cowardice. I say this to the President of the European Parliament and to the President of the Commission: the Presidency will work hand in hand with you. If any Member State does not agree, let it speak up. As I said to the Polish President, he himself negotiated the Lisbon Treaty, he gave his word, and one’s word has to be honoured. It is not a question of politics, but a question of morals.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, Europe has suffered from something else too. Europe has suffered from a lack of debate. I would like to end with this because it is very important to me. Our institutions are independent, but independence does not mean indifference. If we, the political leaders, do not have the courage to debate, who will? To debate what? What is the right economic strategy? What is the right monetary strategy? What is the right exchange rate strategy? What is the right interest rate strategy? Of course everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and I say this to our German friends in particular. However, no one has the right to prevent a debate, a constructive debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course everyone wants an agreement, such as the trade agreement which is in the process of being negotiated. However, no one must be afraid of saying that Europe must not be naive. We have to discuss the advantages of free trade, but we must also tell emerging countries that there are no grounds for them to demand the same rights without taking on the same obligations. We must not be afraid to hold a European debate. We must engage in a dignified European debate, but we must not be afraid to defend our beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not questioning the ECB’s independence when we ask whether it is reasonable to raise interest rates to 4.25% when US interest rates are at 2%. We are having a debate. A peaceful debate, where no one has a monopoly on the truth. I certainly do not, nor do the experts, who have to demonstrate the effectiveness of their decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, that I intend, together with French ministers, to shoulder this responsibility. I know that it is difficult. I know that, when you are President-in-Office of the Council, you are not defending the interests of your country, but the interests of the Union. I know, Mr President, Presidents, that we have to work as a team in the interests of the Europe of 27, and I hope that in six months’ time everyone will be able to say: ‘Europe has made progress thanks to your participation and support.’</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>.<span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be here with you today in the European Parliament for the presentation of the six-month French Presidency of the Council of the European Union. I think that this will be a presidency full of drive and determination and rich in concrete results that we will all work towards. You wanted France to come back to Europe, President-in-Office, and this is unquestionably excellent news for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens and the European Parliament assembled here today expect a great many things from the French Presidency. As I said during our meeting in Paris on 1 July, the Commission will stand by the French Presidency, offering its full support to ensure the success of the European Union during these six months. There will be no shortage of challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation is here to stay and international competition is becoming increasingly tough. The world faces new challenges such as the scarcity of fossil fuels and climate change. We must act now to find common solutions to these challenges. All of these factors mean that Europe needs to reform its economies to become more competitive, modernise its social models and invest in education, research and innovation. Europe has many aces up its sleeve, particularly as one of the world’s leading trading powers. However, it must have the courage to adapt. If we want to offer protection, we must adapt. That is the key.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in denying that Europe is going through a difficult period: the Irish ‘no’ vote and the global economic climate, soaring oil and commodity prices, the sharp rise in food prices and inflationary pressures, which are the greatest enemy of purchasing power. Inflation is also the greatest enemy of social justice as, when there is very strong inflation, those who suffer most are those on low wages or living on a pension. All of these factors are casting a shadow over our economies and forcing our politicians, at both European and national level, to make difficult choices. We must confront these realities head on and apply ourselves to them with realism and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just come back from the G8 summit in Japan, where I could clearly see that the influence enjoyed by the European Union, as well as the expectations and respect that it engenders around the world, are in marked contrast with the gloom that is often expressed within the EU. I can tell you now that, now more than ever, the European Union is seen outside Europe as a positive and decisive player, a player with enormous influence on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take two concrete subjects that were at the centre of the G8 summit: climate change and development – two issues on which Europe has taken the initiative at global level. The United States has now joined us in the fight against climate change by largely subscribing to our views. Last year in Heiligendamm, I remember that we had great difficulty – President Sarkozy was there – in convincing the Americans and the Russians to accept the principle of mandatory targets for 2050. Now we have achieved this. It was possible thanks to our role as European leader; I am proud of this as President of a European institution. It is a success that we yet again owe to European unity.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is development, and specifically soaring food prices, which threaten all of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We were also able to act as a catalyst in this area thanks to the conclusions of last month’s European Council, which, and I quote, welcomed ‘the Commission’s intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries.’</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will adopt this proposal next week. I am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that Europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers, particularly those in Africa, in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations. This support is essential to guarantee ‘the green revolution’ that Africa needs for its stability and prosperity, which, as you all know, is also in Europe’s direct interests. As the European Council requested, our proposal will remain within the limits of the current financial perspective. Our approach consists of allocating the savings that the rise in international prices allows Europe to generate as part of its agricultural support policy to those who are hit hardest by this increase. There are emergency and disaster situations all around the world. If you could have heard what the President of the World Bank said, if you could have heard some of the leaders of African countries and other countries represented in enlarged meetings talk about the hunger and starvation that now represent a real threat to so many people in the world, you would understand to what extent European aid is necessary and indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe that, yet again, we can set a good example of solidarity between European and African farmers, illustrating the fact that the common agricultural policy (CAP) and development policy can and must work in tandem, because, as President Sarkozy has just said, food security is a global issue and we need to tackle it together. Not alone, but together.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is true that there are concerns, but it is also true that, more than ever before, the European Union has a central role in resolving them. Rather than wallow in what I sometimes call ‘crisisophilia’ – there is even talk of the phenomenon of declinism in Europe – let us emphasise the value of the concrete and positive action of the EU. In any case, this is the best way of resolving the international issues raised by Ireland’s non-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. We must address this because the Lisbon Treaty could make us work more effectively, more democratically, although we must not use it as an excuse for failing to respond immediately to the needs of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens are looking to us for answers. The best response we can give them is to talk to them frankly and show that we have political courage. The French Presidency has both qualities in abundance.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe on trial, we must provide evidence that Europe works. We must focus on policies that bring Europe closer to its citizens and change their daily lives. More than ever before, we are plotting a course for a Europe based on results.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am confident. The priorities of your Presidency will allow Europe to meet the major challenges that it faces, while preparing for the issues of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the priority given by the French Presidency to the introduction of an integrated energy and climate change policy. As you said, President-in-Office, this is the top priority of your Presidency, and we know how determined you are to finalise this strategic agreement by the end of the year, which would put the EU in a good position to embark on the Copenhagen negotiations in a year’s time. The Commission will lend its full support so that we can reach an ambitious and balanced agreement with the European Parliament and the Member States. I have made this a priority for my institution, and I would like to thank the President-in-Office once again for his tireless support for the energy and climate package unveiled by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also move towards a policy of controlled immigration in Europe. We must first address immigration, which an ageing Europe needs, in certain key economic sectors, and which must be accompanied by proper integration so that we can be proud in our humanist Europe of the integration that we offer to those who genuinely want to come here to work. The adoption of the ‘blue card’ under the French Presidency would be an important step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also need to tackle illegal immigration and the exploitation that often arises from this, particularly by furthering the proposal to penalise those who employ illegal workers. It is here that we must effectively make the most effort; we must not threaten the poor workers who only want to work in Europe, but penalise those who want to exploit them. This practice is a disgrace to Europe. Let there be no mistake: we must be realistic in addressing the issue of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that our inability to address this issue seriously and responsibly is one of the greatest threats to Europe. We will not solve the immigration issue by being permissive on all fronts. This would be the best excuse for extremist forces, for xenophobic forces. We need to be tough on illegal immigration, and at the same time show that we are generous and united in the integration of migrant communities who want to contribute to Europe’s growth and development. I believe that we need to be clear on this; we need to be tough on crime while continuing to show respect for human rights, which are the trademark of European civilisation and our plans for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally these are sensitive issues, which are easy prey for polemic and misunderstanding. This is why the Commission wanted to put forward a balanced proposal and why it has outlined 10 key principles so that we can go forward together. I was delighted to see the French Presidency and the French justice and interior ministers endorse this integrated approach during their informal meeting in Cannes this week.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that in Europe, in the Schengen Area, where freedom of movement is a reality, it is absurd to continue with 27 different immigration policies. What we need is a European immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in the pipeline is our Social Agenda. There can be no dynamic, competitive economic model without genuine social investment to prevent the risks of poverty, exclusion and marginalisation. France has made the new Social Agenda unveiled by the European Commission a few days ago one of its priorities. I welcome this. To prepare Europeans for the future, we must offer them opportunities, access to quality services, education, healthcare and continuing solidarity. Nobody in Europe must be left by the wayside. Europe is all about opportunity and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, many other projects will be launched over the coming six months. I cannot describe them all here, but if I can briefly outline two, I should like to commend the projects for European defence and the Union for the Mediterranean, which will be unveiled next Sunday in Paris. I see these as two opportunities for Europe to affirm its role in the world. Here too, it is up to us to translate this ambition into concrete action.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the French Presidency of the Council every success, guaranteeing the full support of the Commission throughout the next six months, which promise to be exciting.</p>
<p class="contents">The first duty for politicians is to face up to challenges and redouble efforts to meet them successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">We can do a great deal together. I would like to pay tribute here to the efforts made over the past few months by French Government at the highest level to work closely with the European institutions. The institutions, the Presidency and the Member States must all work hand in hand. This is the key to the joint success that we owe the citizens of Europe, and I would like to pay tribute to the commitment expressed here again today by the President-in-Office so that together, the Council, Parliament and the Commission can find concrete solutions to the concrete problems that our citizens have to face each day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need political commitment to overcome the difficulties faced by European integration. The most entrenched of these is without doubt the Irish ‘no’ vote, discussed here this morning. We must engage our citizens in Europe. There are many reasons why they have doubts, including fears linked to globalisation, rising prices and changes in traditional family and social values.</p>
<p class="contents">If we cannot convince everyone that major issues such as security, climate change, energy and migration can be negotiated effectively only at European level – and with regard to the world’s major regions, Europe must also be strong enough to convince the United States, India, China, and Brazil – we cannot envisage a peaceful future.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency will also need political commitment to convince its partners that the Lisbon Treaty will help us decide more effectively and democratically on all of these common issues. Those members of my group who belong to the European People’s Party would like all Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the Treaty during the French Presidency. After a period of reflection and with all due respect, we look forward, as we did with France and the Netherlands, to Ireland offering its 26 partners a solution to the impasse. We ask each Member State to refrain from any one-upmanship and to act responsibly. Our group would like to see an end to this institutional debate and we are confident that the French Presidency will work towards achieving this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, while we are trying to equip ourselves with a better decision-making tool, our problems are building up. This is consuming energy that could be better spent on job creation, defending our interests and promoting our social model and Europe in general. As I said, we will certainly need political commitment. We should also make sure that we have the commitment to address the priorities that the President-in-Office of the Council has just unveiled. We must act urgently to tackle the issues of climate change, energy, migration, food security and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">On climate change and energy, the alternative is clear: either our Member States are convinced that they must progress and set an example ahead of the Copenhagen Summit, and if so, we must make clear decisions before December to ensure reciprocity from our international partners, or they have decided that, despite worsening climatic conditions and our energy dependence, there is no need to take urgent action. I hardly need tell you which way my political group leans.</p>
<p class="contents">On migration, too, we want an end to this hypocrisy. While a number of countries around the world have already adopted an immigration policy with fairly satisfactory results, most of our countries have delayed these choices. It is time for a debate and a decision on the subject, which must be positive, humane and responsible. The draft European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which will be debated in October, is a step in the right direction, and I congratulate the EU ministers on their response this week to the draft prepared by Brice Hortefeux. You have our support, Mr Hortefeux.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention two topics that are very close to my heart and are vital for the future and for our independence: food security and defence. I would like us to think of the most disadvantaged people, both around the world and in our own countries, for whom rising food prices are a real problem. I would like Europe and the French Presidency to make an effort to help them through these difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of defence, I would just like to ask one question: how can Europe be credible without defence worthy of the name? We need defence to guarantee peace in Europe and to help the world’s most disadvantaged people. Our group supports the commitment of the French Presidency to lead the way by making bold proposals to its partners in these two strategic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, European integration is an eminently political affair. I am in no doubt that, if we are brave enough to make clear political choices, our citizens will rediscover a liking for Europe. I have every confidence that the new Presidency will encourage us in this and we have everything to gain in winning the trust of our citizens ahead of the 2009 European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that you have returned from Japan safe and sound. We have now heard again about the next series of commitments on climate change and it is time we delivered on these.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right that the climate package is a priority: it is one that our group shares with you. You are right, too, when you say that individual states cannot achieve this on their own – not even the Germans and the French, by the way, by reaching agreements on their own in Straubing. There are 25 other countries that are part of this and, above all, it is the European Parliament that makes the final decision. We shall do it with you, cooperatively, but do not take any initiatives on the side – not even with Angela Merkel, however good an idea that may seem to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you mention sport, I had a look at the French newspapers this morning, wondering what they would write today about Mr Sarkozy’s visit to the European Parliament. Nothing! They write a lot about the Tour de France, and it is a German who is wearing the yellow jersey there at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I listened closely to you, Mr President-in-Office, as you made your other points, about climate change and particularly about the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, if we want to deliver, we need instruments, and that puts us in a dilemma. The citizens want us to be more effective, more transparent, more democratic, and they want the national parliaments to be more democratic and have more influence. That is all correct but, every time we want to deliver, the instrument we need – a revised treaty – is snatched from our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right: this means that we need a new approach, a fresh start. We need to try to bring this Treaty into force. I think it is great that you are going to Ireland and working constructively with the Irish people. If I may give you a personal tip, leave Bernard Kouchner behind in Paris this time. I had the impression that his previous contributions did not exactly help us to convince the Irish.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, I am speaking about a matter on which we hold completely the opposite view to you. You spoke of four priorities for your Presidency, and I was waiting to see if there was a fifth. You then mentioned several other things you said were important – not priorities, just other things. These ‘other things’ included a social Europe, which you said was a matter for the nation-states. I believe that is a serious error.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I want to tell you that we expect a different approach from the French Presidency. A social Europe does not mean that we want to establish a social security office in Europe or that we want to bring in family allowance in Europe. A social Europe is about something else: for a long time, people have believed – and rightly so – that Europe can make economic progress possible. We have spent 50 years working to ensure that economic progress in Europe leads to more growth and more jobs, and always to a guarantee of more social security.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more people are now feeling that quite the opposite is true – that Europe’s economic progress is benefiting a few large conglomerates, certain insurance companies, hedge funds and large enterprises, but not the people. It is the task of the European Union to restore to them the feeling that growth in Europe, the economic progress of this continent, does not serve the banks and the large conglomerates but each individual citizen. Furthermore, if the nation-states have to guarantee this, then you as President-in-Office of the European Council are obliged to tell your fellow Heads of State or Government that they must make sure that social justice, rather than free-market radicalism, takes centre stage in their nation-states.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that we have a European Court of Justice that delivers verdicts every day, and its verdicts can change the degree of social welfare in the individual Member States even though the Member States do not have any instruments with which to resist. This is why we need a social Europe, Mr President-in-Office, and this is why I expect you to change your mind on this issue by December. Otherwise, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not be able to support you.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, fears about social exclusion lead to dangerous developments, and one dangerous development is that governments that are on the defensive believe that they can take people’s minds off this fear of social exclusion by hounding minorities. We are currently seeing this in one European Union Member State. I do not know what percentage of the Italian population is made up of Roma children, but I do know that when a government goes and says ‘they will be registered as by a police records department; they must have their fingerprints taken’, supposedly in order to provide them with social protection, that is a grave offence against Europe’s fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Your country, France, gave the European community of nations its first charter of fundamental rights. The first declaration of human rights came from your country. As President of that republic, you are part of the tradition of your country. I ask you, in your role as President-in-Office of the European Council, to influence Silvio Berlusconi’s government, and tell it that Europe is a community founded upon the rule of law, not a union of caprice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union faces many major challenges but, if we do not guarantee social welfare in Europe, people will turn away from this Europe and, when they turn away, the Treaty of Lisbon will not be of any use; the whole project will fail. We need courage, therefore. I know that you are a courageous man. We support your priorities; now support ours – a social Europe and climate change, institutional reform and human rights. Then your Presidency will be successful.</p>

It has also made the case for a practical, problem-solving Europe stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy and climate packages become more urgent every day. Capping VAT is a short-term sop: Europe should be cutting its dependence on oil and gas. We need much more investment in renewable energy: small-scale and localised to bring household bills down, and large-scale, such as using the Union for the Mediterranean to invest in high-voltage solar thermal power production in North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">On Tuesday the G8, which is the source of nearly two thirds of the world’s CO<span class="sub">2</span>, approved an emissions-reduction target of 50%. But the emerging economies are right to say that the target should be higher – perhaps 80% – with interim targets.</p>
<p class="contents">To stabilise food prices we need good ideas, such as the recent CAP reforms of Commissioner Fischer Boel, not protectionism, however disguised. The truth is that people care more about the petrol price and the bread bill than about the grand aims of our Union. Today nobody should say <span class="italic">‘Qu’ils mangent de la brioche’ </span>(‘Let them eat cake’).</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office is right to put the focus on migration. But migration will be manageable only when we manage the despair that leads so many to risk so much to come here. There should be routes for legal migration, a crackdown on people-smuggling, and reform of our farm policy to kick-start growth in the countries of origin. It may be optimistic to ask a French presidency to liberalise markets. But to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another way in which the French presidency can break new ground. France gave us the Rights of Man. Now France must lead in their defence. At home, by pressing ahead with the anti-discrimination directive. Abroad: by anchoring peace in the Balkans in a European Union future; by using the Union for the Mediterranean to improve human rights in North Africa; and by uniting in our dealings with Russia and condemning China’s crackdown on dissent. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> President-in-Office, do not go to Beijing. Play a team game.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was Voltaire who told us: ‘Mortals are equal; it is not birth, but virtue alone that makes the difference.’ </p>
<p class="contents">And by taking a lead, Europe can demonstrate its virtue and demand that the dignity of every man and woman be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, to succeed, you will need to build consensus. You will need Parliament, Council and Commission to work together to a common agenda set by 27 Member States and this House. If we are to argue, it must be about that agenda, not its messengers. You have plunged into a polemic with the President of the ECB and with two Commissioners, but they represent our Union and the policies we have agreed. It is not the European way to divide and rule. We must stand on our principles but work together to achieve our common goals. </p>

<p class="contents">As Strasbourg is symbolic of renewed peace, so today the European flag flies alongside the national flags, and should be a visible representation of the symbol of all citizens united by a common project for defence, security, cultural and economic growth, and the transparency of the Central Bank: perhaps that is still missing from the new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Politics needs to give young people definite goals. There can be no economic future without respect for the environment and there can be no respect for rights without recognition of the associated duties. We hope that the French Presidency includes in its objectives the European Charter of Duties. Democracy and freedom are based on the application of rules. The internet cannot be a tool of terrorism, child traffickers and incitements to violence. We need to harmonise our countries’ laws, from immigration to the protection of minors, from energy to compatible progress.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Europe for a new relationship with Africa. Not just green certificates or trade but mutual growth, jointly sharing the Euro-Mediterranean project; we must think of the pockets of terrorism in Mogadishu and the violence in Zimbabwe that are preventing the development of democracy. There is too much hesitation within the EU: we are asking the Council to approve ‘made in’ so that international trade can have clear rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against counterfeiting and illegality is an economic problem but it also affects our citizens’ health, and small and medium-sized enterprises are a cultural value that should be defended. We offer the French Presidency our staunch support so that hopes may become reality shared by the citizens and so that, possibly, by supporting the development of scientific advances to combat rare diseases, we can also combat our intelligent friend Mr Schulz’s endemic antipathy towards Prime Minister Berlusconi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would even say, to paraphrase a song that you know, ‘it is a drug we are all hooked on.’</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one thing that I would like to say. If we are ambitious enough to say that we must accept the climate package as it is one minute and that we will bow down before the German car industry lobby the next, then we have lost, because everyone will come and say: ‘do not forget about us’. This is the problem. We cannot complain about petrol being too expensive, yet at the same time allow the car industry to build gas-guzzling vehicles. We have had the technology to build energy-efficient cars for 15 years now, but because there are no rules forcing manufacturers to do this, consumers are now paying for petrol at the price it is. This is the truth of the matter; this is how things are.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You mention the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. Let us have a European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, then. Initiate a dialogue: for legal emigration, let the European Parliament take part under the codecision procedure so that we have a genuine political debate, a genuine democratic debate. I am fed up, Mr Daul, because whenever we talk about emigration, after 15 seconds we start talking about illegal immigration, the threat of immigration. First of all, if Europe is what it is today, it is thanks to the men and women who have built it with us. That is the truth.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Please, I am no angel, but we have built a house with no doors. People are coming in through the windows. I say to you: ‘Let us throw open the doors so that people can come into Europe, and then we will decide what to do about those who come in illegally.’ You say to us: ‘We need skilled workers’, yet at the same time, Europe sends home tens of thousands of students each year who have come here to study. Let them stay here; if they have studied here, they are not illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Now turning to the points on which you said that the social dimension is not within Europe’s remit. President-in-Office, you will not protect Europeans if we do not work together to combat social and fiscal dumping. We need Europeans to face up to this problem. We need to put a stop to it, and we stand by you on this. We need to have a discussion with the Central Bank? Let us have a discussion, then. We need to have a discussion with the Irish? Let us have one. We must stop saying that the social dimension is not part of the European remit. This cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to turn to the issues on which we are deeply divided. You are going to China to attend the opening of the Olympic Games with the Chinese President. I hope you enjoy it! Personally, I will be thinking of all the prisoners rotting in Chinese prisons. I will be thinking of all those who have been arrested. I will be thinking of all those who are being mistreated in Tibet. You had a golden opportunity to defend the European values of democracy and liberty by saying, ‘I will not attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, this masquerade of the Chinese Communist Party.’ This is what we want to hear.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the centre and left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that when you come to write your memoirs, you will regret what you have done. You will regret it because the people who locked up these innocent citizens will be saying to them, ‘You see, we can do what we want: the Western world only wants our markets.’ Mr President, it is a disgrace, it is pathetic, to go to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.</p>

<p class="contents">Its strong point, in relation to the usual tenors of the Union, is that it does not say that Europe is doing well and that it should continue along these lines when increasing numbers of Europeans think that it is doing badly and that things should change. So far so good. But what then? This is where the problem lies. What conclusions do you draw, Mr President, from this apparent lucidity about the crisis of legitimacy that the Union is experiencing today, in particular its economic model and its operating mode?</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you want to understand and that you respect the concerns that Europeans have about the Union, but you put pressure on the Irish people to go back on their decision, when they were only voicing, like the French and the Dutch, what millions of other Europeans are thinking. You criticise, rightly, the way the European Central Bank has been managing the euro from its ivory tower, but you never recommend re-examining the statutes which grant it all those powers and even assign it this task!</p>
<p class="contents">You state, on the subject of immigration, that you want to ‘serve our values’, but you supported the shameful directive, condemned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, by all human rights organisations and by European churches, precisely because it violates essential human values. You ignore the social question – which, you say, should remain the sole responsibility of Member States – but you say nothing about the European Court of Justice, which delivers ruling upon ruling placing the different social models within the Union in competition with each other and basing itself on Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you did not like the image of the ‘Polish plumber’. Neither did I. This was an expression coined by the populist right and made popular on television screens by Mr Bolkestein. I say ‘Welcome to workers from all countries’ on an equal footing in all fields.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely what current European law refuses. President-in-Office, may I remind you that, according to the Commission, in Lower Saxony, for the same work on the same construction site, a worker from another Member State can be paid half the minimum wage applicable to a German worker. This is what we do not want. Do you know what a man who cannot be accused of populism, namely John Monks, Secretary-General for the European Trade Union Confederation, thinks? He considers these decisions ‘considerably problematic’ because, he says, they decree ‘the primacy of economic freedoms over fundamental rights and the respect of labour law.’ What is your answer to that?</p>
<p class="contents">You claim that you want to build a ‘Europe which protects’, but we do not hear you criticising all those structural measures which make the existence of Europeans precarious: the obligation to open public utility undertakings to competition; the pressures of the Stability Pact on wages and social spending and the number of ‘guidelines’ prepared by the Commission and adopted by the Council, which you apply in your own country with zeal.</p>
<p class="contents">I could mention Guideline No 2: the reform of pension, social security and health care schemes. Guideline No 5: labour market flexibility. Guideline No 13: the removal of regulatory, commercial and other obstacles which hinder competition unduly. And I have not mentioned all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The reversal of France’s – and Italy’s – position has just enabled the Council to go beyond the obligations that it set itself by agreeing on a draft Directive permitting a 65-hour week. This consecrates Dickens as the new father of Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">One last word, Mr President: this weekend, in front of your European guests – the President of Parliament, the President of the Commission and in front of 2 000 French right-wing business executives – you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement – and a very unwise one – by stating that now, when there is a strike, the French people no longer even notice. The day after this lofty event, your Minister for Education explained that this was ‘a way of reassuring our European partners in the presence of the most eminent among them.’ Well then, if you must insult the trade unions to reassure European leaders, it is definitely time for change in Europe.</p>

The people of Europe are seeing more and more every day that all of their powers are trickling through their fingers, that their freedoms are being taken away, whether it be purchasing power, an expensive euro, GMOs, tax, fisheries, a lack of trade protection, immigration, or even football, which you yourself mentioned a few moments ago. Everything is trickling through their fingers, and I would say, Mr President of the Republic, President of the European Union, that everything is trickling through your fingers. You say so yourself, you point it out as a criticism. Well it is high time to act and to bring your actions in line with your words.</p>
<p class="contents">A moment ago you criticised the lack of Community preference, and you are right. However, let me remind you that it was removed by the Marrakesh Agreement, which you approved, and it is not in the Lisbon Treaty, which you drew up.</p>
<p class="contents">You deplore the irresponsibility of the Central Bank, and you ask for a debate to be started. As for us, we want decisions. Perhaps I can remind you here that this independence of the Central Bank, this irresponsibility that we see at work every day, was organised and formalised by the Maastricht Treaty. You regret having obtained the agreement of Brussels for a drop in oil taxation, but that is simply a consequence of the Treaties of Nice and Amsterdam, which you ratified through the parliamentary route.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, you complain today and every day about the effects of what you encourage every day, in other words stripping away the powers of the State for the benefit of post-democratic forums, made up of officials, bankers and judges. Your Presidency of the European Union is a historic opportunity to get Europe moving in the right direction again, a Europe rooted in the freedom of nations that respects democracy. This is why we are asking you to honour the vote of the Irish people and to pronounce the Lisbon Treaty dead. It is not the European people who have to reconcile with Brussels, it is Brussels that has to reconcile with the European people!</p>

Unlike the majority of the French electorate, you have shown yourself to be zealously pro-European, even going as far as presenting once again, in the barely different form of the Lisbon Treaty, the Constitution which, along with the Dutch, the French people rejected in 2005. Alas, your plans have hit a snag in the form of the will of the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Treaty is therefore void, despite all the schemes that it would seek to impose on the European people, the will of the ruling euro-globalist camarilla.</p>
<p class="contents">As a young member of parliament, in 1957 I voted against the Treaty of Rome, the first stage of a process which, according its promoters, Monnet and Coudenhove-Kalergi among others, was to lead to the United States of Europe: this Tower of Babel that can only be built on the ruins of the nations, and first of all of my homeland, France. Since then I have been resolutely opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that globalisation is bringing about fundamental changes everywhere, that we must submit to. In reality, however, all over the world the nations are gaining strength, supported by fervent patriotism, apart from in just one area – Europe – where nations and homelands are sacrificed, dismantled and demoralised for the benefit of a project that has no strength and no identity, while waves of foreign immigrants gradually invade it and the opening up of our economic borders leaves it open to furious competition from the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">None of the promises made to the European people in order for them to accept the loss of their independence, their sovereignty, their identity and their culture have been kept: neither growth, nor full employment, nor prosperity, nor security, and the predominant feeling is of anxiety as we stand on the brink of a looming systemic crisis: energy, food and financial crises. In the meantime it is true that the media circus will continue. Yesterday, the European football championship, the tennis at Roland Garros, tomorrow the Olympic Games in Beijing, and today, the miraculous saga of an icon, Ingrid, who laughs, cries, prays and comes and goes on your brotherly arm!</p>
<p class="contents">In your desire to be the liberator, you got involved in the negotiations with the FARC terrorists, but it was not you or Mr Chavez who freed the Colombian Senator Mrs Betancourt. It was President Uribe who persistently, against the general movement of global progressivism, won a decisive victory over criminal terrorism. You made repeated futile attempts and you even went as far as inviting the repentant communist FARC terrorists to come and receive asylum in France; but to protect them from whom? From President Uribe, the democrat? As you have gone this far, why not the Taliban, Hezbollah or the Tamil Tigers? You are like the amphisbaena that was so dear to Césaire. Have no doubt, Mr President, all your talents in orchestrating the media will not be sufficient to ward off the imminent dangers that you will have to face before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Europe is a vessel that is going off course, battered by the wind and waves, the only region in the world that has deliberately dismantled its political and moral structures, that has no borders and is gradually being invaded by mass immigration that is only just beginning! Economically ruined by ultraliberalism, socially impoverished, demographically weakened, with no spirit and no defence force, it is doomed at best to be a U.S. protectorate, and at worst to the servitude of dhimmitude. It is high time to abandon the fatal illusion of federalism and build a Europe of the nations, united by more tangible alliances that will undoubtedly be more modest, but more effective. The dual failures of the Constitution and the Treaty should serve as a warning. The people of Europe do not want anything to do with these plans and will not allow them to be imposed on them because they do not want to die.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Sarkozy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to thank Mr Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for his support and that of his group, which will be invaluable to the French Presidency. I agree with your analyses and am sure you will understand that I will not go back over each of the points, even though your commitment regarding a defence policy is entirely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, allow me to say that I appreciated the sense of responsibility in your speech. As with Mr Daul, we met and had discussions, and there are no secrets. Democracy should not be a shadow theatre. It should enable us to compare our ideas and try to reach a compromise. You can be sure that, as in the case of Mr Daul, the French Presidency appreciates the support of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and your support on matters of consensus. Moreover, I do not see why I would say that this support is of less use to me because it comes from the Chairman of the Socialist Group, or why you would seek out conflicts with the Presidency under the pretext that I am not of the same political persuasion as you.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say that regarding the energy and climate package, I am perfectly aware, and I also say this to Mr Daul, that it is Parliament that will have the last word; but better than that, it is not just a question of having the last word. It is the mobilisation of Parliament that will put pressure on the Member States that do not have the same ambitions as Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency. I would not say, Mr Schulz, that you will have the last word. I am saying that your commitment is absolutely critical.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to Mr Cohn-Bendit that it is not about getting down on bended knee in front of anyone, especially not the car industry, be it French, Italian or German. Why just target the German industry? In this case, the President-in-Office of the Council has to take into account the legitimate interests of each of the Member States. What we have to do is resist the industrial lobby while allowing it to have fair conditions, and clearly explaining that the fact that we are defending the energy and climate package does not mean that we are naive.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Mr Cohn-Bendit, as we want to achieve planetary balance, I would not like us to be accused of promoting relocations. It is not about respecting the environment and accepting relocations; it is about respecting the environment and rejecting relocations. Any other way of thinking is suicidal. If you ask the Member States to choose between the environment and growth, you will place us all at an impasse. Sustainable development and respect for the environment are factors in economic growth. This is why, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will not resent my preferring Mr Schulz’s or Mr Daul’s analysis to yours, just this once.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr Schulz, let us come to what you identified as a point of disagreement. Allow me to say that I do not think so. I would also like to say to you that Europe is not responsible for the fact that our German friends have not managed to reach an agreement on a minimum wage, but rather it is the German political debate that has caused you to reject a minimum wage. Do not saddle Europe with the responsibility for a social failing that is down to national political debate!</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, as President-in-Office of the Council, it is not for me to pass judgment. I would quite simply say, ‘Do not ask us, Mr Schulz, to resolve problems that you Germans have not been able to resolve between you.’ I would like to add that in France, in terms of social matters, we attach a great deal of importance to the minimum wage. What would social harmonisation mean? You Germans have rejected a minimum wage. We French want to keep our minimum wage. Social harmonisation would therefore mean that we would have to reject our minimum wage because the Germans do not have one. I reject this social regression, including in the name of my European ideal. Thank you, Mr Schulz, for allowing me to clarify my social commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, however, Mr Schulz, that you are entirely right about raising the moral standards of financial capitalism, the rules that apply to credit rating agencies and the entirely reprehensible conduct of some of our financial establishments, and I would like to say something else: in all of our countries there have been directors of large banks who liked to lecture politicians about the rigour with which affairs of state should be conducted.</p>
<p class="contents">Having seen what has happened in a number of large private banks, I would say that those who gave lectures were very poorly placed to give them, and that they should now prepare themselves to receive them. I would like to add, Mr Schulz – I say this under the watchful eye of Mr Watson – that I am against protectionism. I am in favour of freedom, but we can no longer continue in a world in which there are no rules, in which credit rating agencies do whatever they like, in which a number of financial establishments want to make billions of euros in a few seconds by speculating on the trading floors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe that we want, and, Mr Schulz, the French Presidency will make proposals on this subject, proposals for regulations to raise the moral standards of financial capitalism, because we can see now that the reasons that global growth has halted for a year is because of the sub-prime crisis and the crisis of confidence in the financial institutions, which have done whatever they like, whenever they like, lending money to anyone under any conditions. If Europe has any sense, it needs to restore some order to what has become the law of anything goes. I would like to say to Mr Schulz that I entirely agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the European immigration pact, I would like to say to Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit that the French Presidency will involve the European Parliament. This is the best way to avoid excesses. You talked about the excesses, Mr Schulz, that are the practice in one country – it is not my place to mention it – but if we all agree on a minimum corpus for the cost, those excesses that you pointed out will no longer take place, and, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am sure that Mr Daul would agree, why would the European Parliament not be involved in this? I am not sure that it would be institutionally possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Off-microphone intervention from Mr Cohn-Bendit)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am aware of your generosity. In general you are always ready to give advice, especially to me. Even if I suffered from such modesty as yours, I would not need this advice. I knew that unanimity was required, but irrespective of that there is no need for unanimity in order for me to say to the European Parliament that the question of immigration is sufficiently important for it to be discussed politically, for you to be involved in it, even before there is a Lisbon Treaty or any modification of it. It is a political commitment that I am making and I will come with Bernard Kouchner and Brice Hortefeux to present the pact to you, to discuss it with you. We will consider with the President of Parliament and perhaps the Conference of Presidents the conditions under which you would like us to put this in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson, difficulties provide an opportunity. Obviously, when one chooses to be the President of a country and has the responsibility of the Presidency of the Union for six months, if one does not like problems or difficulties it is better not to be European and not to be involved in politics. Personally I think that these difficulties are an opportunity. Can you see why? It is because they are an opportunity for us to move beyond our national selfishness and our partisan prejudices.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say that, if everything were going well, my appearance before the European Parliament would not necessarily have gone better, because a year from the elections, when you have the wind behind you and everything is going well, everyone is thinking of their partisan or national interests. As I believe that here, in the main, the vast majority of MEPs are Europeans, they are aware of the gravity of the situation. Everyone has to make an effort. I am not sure whether, Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit, you would have been as open towards the French Presidency if things had been easier. Personally I think that these difficulties can be an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, Mr Watson, on which I clearly made an error. I should have talked at more length about the European energy policy. There are a number of you here who wear particular T-shirts because you are against a type of power. I respect you. Others have made other choices. However, there is a point that could unite all of us, which is that we need a European energy policy, with transparency on stocks and pooling of resources on solar power, photovoltaic power, biomass power and hydraulic power. Forgive me for not having said it during my initial speech, but defining an energy policy – notwithstanding our differences on nuclear power, notwithstanding those differences – will be a priority for the French Presidency. I do not think that President Barroso will mind me saying this, as it is also his priority. This is something on which we cannot waste any time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to Mr Watson that I am not protectionist. I never have been and I never will be. However, the Liberals also need to think about something: we are opening up our borders and we have benefited from it. However, at the same time the others cannot ask us to do here what they do not agree to us doing there. China, India, Brazil, Mexico – the big emerging countries – cannot say, ‘Open up your borders, reduce your subsidies, but here we will do what we want.’ That is not free trade, and that is not a service to give them. Just as loving your country is not nationalism, wanting reciprocity and protection is not protectionism. It is possible to be in favour of free trade and to want to establish a balance in that free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson, we will have more to discuss. Some place an emphasis on protection, others on freedom. Perhaps we can meet halfway.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to congratulate you, Mr Watson. I think that in terms of songs we have the same taste.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will pass on your appreciation to the person concerned, and I am sure that she will sign her latest CD for you, Mr Watson. No hard feelings.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit, I have already answered many of your questions. I would like to discuss two subjects. The first one is the issue of students, which is an extremely important matter. Of course Europe needs to open up to training the elites of the whole world. I have even thought for some time that opening up to training the elites of the whole world means welcoming them into our universities and, at the same time, giving them the opportunity of initial professional experience. I am particularly thinking about doctors. However, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we need to be careful not to plunder the elites of the developing world. In France there are, and you should think about this, more Beninese doctors practising than there are in Benin itself. I think that Benin needs its elites. It is not refusing immigration to refuse to plunder the elites of the developing world. We will not exhaust this debate in a few minutes. I am grateful to you for the way in which you mentioned it, but you must understand that it deserves an in-depth debate and not caricatures. It is not a case of generous people on the one hand and heartless people on the other. There are statesmen and women who are going to try to find the best solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will permit me, I would like to say one thing about the issue of China, which is an extremely serious and extremely difficult issue. I would like to say, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that like everyone here, I heard the emotion in your voice, which is a credit to you, and I would like to say that I share your feelings. I would also like to say to Mr Watson, who asked me to be a team player, that this is exactly what I have done, because as President-in-Office of the Council, I spoke to all the Member States to find out what they thought and whether any of them were opposed to my taking part – I will speak in a moment about the substance; I am speaking first about the form. I would like to say that I received agreement from all the Member States to attend the Olympic opening ceremony. As you know it is a difficult subject, which I think we need to tackle very carefully, as we cannot afford to get it wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Watson told me to be ‘a team player’. I want you to know that I discussed this with all the Member States. None of them were opposed to my taking part, and currently thirteen of them will be represented at the opening ceremony. This is not a reason, Mr Watson, it is simply a response to the issue of being a team player.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if you will, let us get to the heart of the matter. I understand those who say that Europeans should not attend the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing. Everyone has the right to have a view on the best way of defending human rights, and I have to respect those who say that we should boycott the ceremony. However, my personal opinion is – and I think that this opinion should be respected, because it is respectable – that it is not by humiliating China that we will make progress on the issue of human rights, but through a frank and direct dialogue. I would even like to say this: I do not think that we can boycott a quarter of humanity. I do not think this is an intelligent or responsible choice for someone who has the responsibility of being the President-in-Office of the Council to say to a quarter of humanity, ‘We will not come; we are humiliating you in the eyes of the whole world.’ I want to go there and I want to talk.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the core issue of defending human rights, we are in agreement. Regarding the way in which to defend those human rights, acknowledge that there can be a debate and that the debate will not end with the issue of the Olympic Games. I therefore want to go there, talk about human rights and defend them. I am even going to go further than that, Mr Cohn-Bendit. There are things that I will not say to China, because China should be respected; but there are things that China should not say to the European countries, particularly not to France, because France and the European countries should be respected just as China should be. It is not up to China to fix my schedule and appointments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, it is not up to me to fix the schedule and meetings of the Chinese President. I will therefore defend the issue of human rights, and, at the same time, as a head of state, I have to consider something. We always talk about agreements. I would like to challenge this, as for a democratically elected head of state it is not illegitimate to defend the economic interests and jobs of his fellow citizens. I want to talk about something else. China is a permanent member of the Security Council. We need China in order to put an end to the scandal in Darfur, because China is influential in Sudan. We need China in order to isolate Iran, so that neither Iran nor anyone that dares to say that they are going to wipe Israel off the map has access to a nuclear bomb. How can we say to China, ‘Help us to establish peace in the world, to ensure stability in the world’, and at the same time boycott the country at a time when it is hosting a fundamental event for 1.3 billion inhabitants? That would not be reasonable, it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self-respecting statesman.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Having expressed my respect for the opinions and feelings of Mr Cohn-Bendit, and of everyone in this House who thinks the same way, I would finally like to add this: respect those who, like us, think as I do. Before going, I questioned Mr Watson and Mr Schulz, the Chairman of the Socialist Group, and I think that I can say on his behalf that he is entirely in agreement with the need not to boycott China. He is a socialist, I am not. I questioned Mr Daul, who is entirely in agreement with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one last thing. Look at what China did in terms of being pragmatic regarding the issue of Hong Kong. Remember, ladies and gentlemen, that it was a very difficult matter. Fifteen years ago, there were demonstrations in Hong Kong. China was able to be pragmatic in resolving the issue of Hong Kong. Look at Macao. China has been able, through dialogue, to resolve the issue of Macao. I am even going to go further. Look at the issue of Taiwan today, where the progress made by President Hu Jintao on Taiwan is remarkable. Five years ago, everyone thought it inevitable that there would be a confrontation between Taiwan and China, which is not the case. Will we move China forward through frank, courageous, direct dialogue, or through humiliation? I have chosen dialogue, frankness and courage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, just one minute, out of courtesy to Mr Wurtz. First of all, I would like to say to him that he can be reassured that I am not insulting the unions, but I thank him for pointing out that France can be changed, as is currently happening, without paralysing it. It is an insult to the unions to think that their only use is to paralyse. The unions have a role of social democracy, just as political leaders do. No more and no less. However, what I meant to say is that no one has the right to take users hostage. I am sure that a man as courteous as you, Mr Wurtz, who has never blocked anything, can understand what I am saying.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, Mr Wurtz, we do not agree, but that does not prevent me from greatly appreciating the way in which you express your disagreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Villiers, I would like to say that I understand your discourse even more given that you indisputably represent a significant political tendency in our country, but also in Europe. I will even say better than this, Mr de Villiers. Personally I do not take your discourse as a discourse against Europe but as a call to build Europe in a different way. Mr de Villiers, I do not want to pit the ‘yes’ camp against the ‘no’ camp. I simply want to try to integrate everyone into a different Europe, based around democracy, peace and growth. I noted your reservations, I am aware of them and I will try to respond to them, not with words but with facts.</p>
<p class="contents">As for you, Mr Le Pen, as I was listening to you I was saying to myself that for years France had the great misfortune of having the most powerful extreme right wing in Europe. Listening to you, Mr Le Pen, I am very glad that this has come to an end.</p>

Firstly, may I thank you, Sir, on behalf of the British Conservative delegation for your hospitality last week and say how much we look forward to working with you to ensure a successful presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We are confident of your energy and your commitment and, having read a very good book recently, we are confident of your vision. I refer, of course, to your own book <span class="italic">Témoignage</span>. For those colleagues who have not yet had the benefit of reading this remarkable work, may I suggest that you do so and, in particular, I recommend that you open the book on page 146. There you describe the follies of the 35-hour week and you describe the benefits: to use the UMP slogan, ‘<span class="italic">travailler plus pour gagner plus’</span>. You go on to say: ‘Rather than the uniform and rigid policy of the 35 hours and the guillotine of retirement at 60, I think our fellow citizens expect a policy of free choice which permits those that wish to earn more to work more and for everyone to regulate their own working hours according to their lifestyle.’</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, you have got it in one! That is the true social Europe. It is not for governments to force people to work more or compel them to work less, but it is for governments to enable people to work more if people choose to work more.</p>
<p class="contents">Your party is about freedom; your party is about choice, and that is what the British Conservative Party is about as well. So, if these principles guide your presidency, we shall be alongside you all the way. When the Working Time Directive is revised, we shall be on the side of freedom and choice; when the Temporary Workers Directive is reviewed, we shall, again, be on the side of freedom and choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, President-in-Office, let me say that our parties should not just be about enabling free choice; they are also about respecting the people’s choice once the people have freely chosen. Therefore, I urge you to respect the choice of the people of Ireland in their recent referendum. I urge you to regard their decision not as a problem to be addressed but as an opportunity to be grasped – an opportunity for Europe to reconnect with its people. This will, of course, take much work with you and your colleagues on the Council. But as you yourself have said: <span class="italic">travailler plus pour gagner plus</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernard Poignant  (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am a French and European socialist. This means that in Paris, I am not one of your supporters, but in Strasbourg, I am not entirely one of your opponents, especially when I see you surrounded by two social democrats. Even if my President is in the wrong in my country, he is still my President. I therefore wish the French Presidency, and therefore the European Presidency, success.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the start I have relaxed while observing you, because I understand your desire to be in the French Parliament. What I am seeing is a head of state, certainly, but also a somewhat frank Prime Minister. Regarding the social chapter and your priorities, I think that a distinction needs to be made. There are indeed matters that need to remain national. I am thinking about pensions. However, for everything that affects employment, such as a single market, a single currency and free movement, we need to aim at harmonising towards the best that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">A distinction therefore needs to be made. I would like to add that, in this chapter, I would have liked you to put considerable effort into establishing a framework directive for public services. You did it for restaurateurs, and it needs to be done for public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not think that the European crisis is only social and democratic. I think that it is also an identity crisis. From the point when peace was obtained, freedom won and democracy established, the world as it is has made it difficult for many of our citizens to see and understand the meaning of the history of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why matters such as culture, education, the mobility of artists, young people, students and twinning, all of those things are fundamental, because European consciousness can no longer be taken for granted. It will build itself up, and I think that these subjects need to pervade the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, obviously we are going to judge you on six months. For a French person that is fine, because in France that is a long time, as you know. So in December we will have the results. What is certain is that the Treaty will definitely not have been ratified. You wanted a simplified treaty, and you have a complicated situation, so get yourself out of it!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with a phrase that I have borrowed from a Polish writer, which says this Mr President, if you will allow me, ‘Being French means taking into consideration something other than France.’ That is the reputation we have, and perhaps you have too a little bit, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This ‘no’ should obviously not be underestimated, and I think that, on the contrary, it should force all political leaders to take into account the expectations and concerns of the people and try to provide answers to them, whatever treaty is in force. It is not the case that if we had the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow everything would disappear with a wave of a magic wand.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency has chosen to focus on four areas, which is obviously very helpful, especially regarding climate change. However, during this time of deep crisis, a financial and food crisis, an explosion in the price of raw materials, and increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive oil, I think that what the people are expecting is not only a matter of issues, but also a matter of vision; what the people are expecting is a matter of prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now I would like to suggest three avenues for reflection. The first concerns the fundamental, essential issue of our identity. I believe, I have a deep conviction, that there is a European model, that there is a European blueprint for society. This European model is economic, sustainable and also social. This European model, for example, seeks to combat the growing inequalities. There is, therefore, a European model, and we should be proud of it, we should assert it, carry it, take it up, defend it and protect it. That is the first avenue.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a second avenue for reflection. I think that we need a new vision for the organisation of the world. In saying that, I am thinking particularly of Africa. I am thinking of the issue of agricultural products; I think we should stop subsidising exports of our agricultural products and instead work towards Africa being self-sufficient in terms of food and energy. This is the new revolution that we need in order to have a fairer world in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe, and we should never stop reminding ourselves of this, that there are European values that we should never renounce: they are called democracy and human rights, and they are valid for us in Europe, and will be valid in the future of the Union for the Mediterranean, where it will not be about doing business above all while neglecting human rights. The issue of human rights is essential for the coming decades; it is the deep-seated identity of Europe and deserves to be defended.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are some of the questions that I feel are before us; they concern fundamental matters, in other words, the vision and the deeper meaning that we must and want to give to Europe. These questions are not only a matter of politics, but also a matter of conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For too long we have been hoisted with the petard of failed ideologies of the past, the failure to look to the new frontiers which come before us and to meet those challenges head on. We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post-fascist commands or even, dare I say it, new 20th-century thinking with regard to human life and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the complexity of the world today is very different and far more varied than what can be offered by any one single ideology or any one single plan. And rightly you mention the importance of engaging with other governments around the world: with China to solve the problem of Chad and of Sudan, ensuring that the problems with regard to Africa and the developing world are met head on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already commemorating today the lives of seven peacekeepers in Sudan who have lost their lives under a United Nations mandate, simply because of a failure of governments to intervene properly and put pressure on the authorities in Chad and in Sudan to protect the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is all very well to speak woolly words here in Parliament about the importance of immigration and allowing the free movement of people. It is better if we allow people to stay at home. I come from Ireland, a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years. None of them wanted to leave Ireland. They were forced to leave Ireland. If we give people the opportunity to remain in their own countries, give them support through the mechanisms of the policies that we set up, whether in trade or other areas, then we can do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President-in-Office, you spoke earlier about how you felt the legitimacy of your position in bringing the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the parliament was the only way to do it. I agree with you. That is right for France. But equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected. It is not an either/or. There are problems and difficulties with regard to the result in Ireland, but that is not just a problem with regard to Ireland’s relationship with Europe. It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are a very good orator, Mr Sarkozy, but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener. This presidency programme that you have unveiled this morning shows that you want a European Union that controls literally every single aspect of our lives, everything from a common immigration policy through to how we run our hospitals and our football clubs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also took it from your comments that you want us to be very isolated from the rest of the world, that if people do not have the same standards as us we are not going to trade with them. But worst of all, it is the sheer arrogance of saying that you know best when it comes to the European project. You are showing contempt, not just for the Irish people, but for the very concept of democracy which you say you are a champion of.</p>
<p class="contents">You said the Polish President must keep his word, that he must ratify the Treaty because that was his agreement. Well, the Irish people have spoken. Will you respect the Irish vote? Will you keep your side of that bargain which says this Treaty is dead? I do not think that you get it, do you? The peoples of Europe do not want deeper political integration. That is why in France they said ‘no’, and in Holland they said ‘no’, and in Ireland they said ‘no’, and if we had a vote in Britain an overwhelming majority of us would have said ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">What price democracy, Mr Sarkozy? You are going to Dublin on 21 July. Please do not try to do with them as you did in France and try to bypass a second referendum, try to get them to change the rules and to ratify this Treaty through the back door.

Your presence at the head of the Council is already a guarantee of determination. In this respect, we have all seen, here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, the quality of preparation for this six-month Presidency, and the extent to which the members of the French Government make themselves available.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities that you have just set out are the right ones to respond to the concerns of EU citizens. In the same way, the other challenges that you raised, including the economic governance of the euro area in response to the explosion of global prices of raw materials and hydrocarbons, or the creation of an area of stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean Basin, are entirely representative of your commitment to a European Union that is more reactive to problems and more attentive to its population.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to public opinion, where there are doubts and people sometimes give in to the temptation to withdraw to national level in order to solve problems, it is more important than ever to point out that our continent has a considerable number of assets and is still one of the rare areas of stability in a world that is increasingly unpredictable. The European Union should seek to demonstrate that it does not undergo globalisation without protecting its people, and I welcome your commitment to proving that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the Union is going through a significant crisis of confidence, we sincerely want the French Presidency to bring an end to the more than fifteen years of efforts to reform the functioning of the enlarged Europe. We need the Lisbon Treaty to come into force as soon as possible, which you have strongly affirmed. We all have confidence in you to negotiate with our Irish friends and to convince the few Member States that are still hesitating to ratify it and to do so once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket, and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag. We interpret this symbolic gesture as proof of your determination to act in the service of the Community, and we thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You talk wisely about the new Lisbon Treaty, and I say to Mr Farage that he has forgotten the Danish case. We voted ‘no’ to Maastricht but we voted ‘yes’ to the Edinburgh agreement and we would never ever dream of saying that because we voted ‘no’ in the first instance we will block the rest of Europe. We would never say that. Mr Farage is wrong: this is not democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I want just to assure you, Mr President-in-Office, and assure France, that we found the solution for Denmark and we will find a solution for the Irish people.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this: I have an appeal to you on behalf of the European Social Democratic Party and all my colleagues and leaders and political family. My appeal is that you should add one more priority to your four priorities. My priority – and I hope it will be yours, I know it is yours – is about jobs, is about growth, is about sustainability. You said – and I was so happy to hear you say it – ‘We need better regulation of the financial markets’. I could not agree with you more. We are just working right now in this very Parliament on getting a report through and I hope – and I appeal to my colleagues in the PPE-DE and ALDE Groups – that we can deliver to the French presidency a wise report on better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about transparency. I am talking about better regulation on fairness, bonuses and stock options and all the rest you talked so wisely about. I am talking about accountability, responsibility, to ensure that the financial market is a long-term patient financing power to our long-term investment needs for more jobs and better jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Connected to that is another idea for you. You are right in saying that we are losing growth right now, we are losing jobs right now, especially in the UK, in Spain but also in France. Why do we not take a new initiative for growth, a new coordinated investment action? Imagine the following scenario: if we invest just one per cent more together in education, in structure, in all relevant issues, within the next four years we will get at least 10 million jobs in addition to what we now have. Imagine what we could do together.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that sport is more than the market economy. I would add: I agree, and that goes for the whole of Europe. Europe is more than the market economy. It is about jobs and people. Let us care about them. I wish the French presidency every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) </span>I agree. The Irish ‘no’ must be respected. The Irish people are fully within their rights to vote as they have done. However, all the other countries in Europe also have the right to proceed along the road to a more democratic, more transparent Europe that is more capable of taking action. The Treaty of Lisbon is a step in this direction. Therefore I welcome the fact that ratification is being continued. However, I also think – and here I do not share your view, I disagree – that it would be good to speak openly about the fact that a multi-speed Europe already exists. Think of the euro, the Schengen Agreement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and many other areas. The sensitivities and wishes of the Member States of the EU are reflected in their choice of different speeds for things that they undertake together.</p>
<p class="contents">A multi-speed Europe makes it possible for countries that want to do more together to do so, for it is important that we maintain the voluntary principle in Europe. It is important that the countries who want to do something together do so voluntarily and that all countries have the option of joining in at any time. No country should be forced into a greater degree of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">A multi-speed Europe also makes it easier to continue accession negotiations. I believe it is wrong for Croatia and Turkey to be punished because the majority of Irish people voted no.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you are quite rightly proud that your country is the home of human rights. Human rights are timeless; they are universal. The Olympic Games are a sporting event, not a political event. Therefore, I believe it is wrong for you to want to go to China for the opening ceremony, and I am glad that the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, will not be going to China.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, let me say in closing that you found on your seat a greeting from many of my female fellow Members – a rose and a letter. The letter asks you to play your part in getting more women to the top of the European Union. Women are pinning their hopes on you as a ‘ladies’ man’. Please allow me to add one more request: as a democratically elected representative, I hope that you will support us in ensuring that this European Parliament is able to take an independent decision about where it is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will not be an easy presidency. It coincides with a difficult period, but of course I wish you success. Ireland has rejected the Treaty of Lisbon. We cannot rule out the possibility that Ireland will change its mind in the future, but it is definitely not acceptable to try to influence the Irish decision by means of threats, just as the French and the Dutch were not threatened when they rejected the Treaty three years ago and set today’s problems in motion. EU countries must not be divided into better and worse. I therefore thank you for saying today that none of the 27 Member States can be excluded from the European family, as the lady who spoke before me, Mrs Koch-Mehrin, might perhaps have liked to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the recent opening-up of the job market in France to Poles, among others. We had waited some time for this to happen – a lot longer than in other countries, but better late than never.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I missed hearing in today’s speech was any reference to our largest European neighbour, Ukraine. I nevertheless hope that the summit planned for 9 September 2008 in Evian will bring us significantly closer to the signing of an association agreement with Ukraine. After all, just now a clear signal from us is of particular importance to our friends in Ukraine, especially at a time when there are further threats from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on behalf of the millions of Europeans who are currently afflicted by ever-increasing costs, I would like to thank you, Mr President, for your efforts towards bringing down VAT on fuel.

<p class="contents">There has been only one other time that a President-in-Office of the Council was received even more warmly, but that was only at the opening. By the end, he had delivered nothing on the agenda. That was the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. We are sure, President Sarkozy, that you will finish your Council Presidency in six months’ time with good results. The way you have explained everything today – the way you have dealt with points put by our Members, the fact that you have familiarised yourself with the dossiers, and that you are not presenting a ‘wish list’ but a series of priorities backed up by good reasoning – all this gives me hope that you are indeed capable of carrying out your ambitious programme.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is a matter of working with you to bring the climate package to completion, you can count on the support of this Parliament. However, I fear it is more likely that there will be further problems within the Council, problems with the responsibility of the Council and of the individual Member States: that the quotas envisaged will not be accepted there. We also agree with you that nuclear energy needs to be represented in this climate package. Here in this Parliament there is a clear majority in favour of the civil use of nuclear energy. Do not let those T-shirts confuse you.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Germany and France wanting to take over the leadership of the European Union together in matters of content – not for major declarations of a global political nature – then we are on your side. I must tell you that Mrs Koch-Mehrin was obviously not listening when you explained the reasons behind your position on China. That was a foreign affairs tutorial for this Parliament, and I can only encourage you to remain as consistent and undeviating as you have been in these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These 10 countries include only one European country – Germany. The 27 EU Member States represent only 14% of global emissions. The United States, 17%; Brazil, Russia, India and China have cumulative emissions that exceed one third of the global carbon dioxide emissions. All of this proves that European initiatives to combat climate change will continue to be in vain without comparable efforts from the Americans, the Chinese and the other industrialised nations.</p>
<p class="contents">While awaiting such an agreement, Europe must fight against carbon leakage. Currently no large industrial group is making investments in Europe. ArcelorMittal is closing in France but investing in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, India and China. ThyssenKrupp is investing in Brazil; the Austrian Vöest Group is investing in India. In North Africa 10 factories are currently being built to produce floating glass for the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of a specific commitment from the other industrial States, Europe must show its determination to defend its industrial fabric, its industrial know-how. Imposing sacrifices on European citizens will not serve any purpose if the rest of the world does not follow suit.</p>

I see scepticism as something that belongs to the spirit of Munich, and it is the acid that dissolves the European will. That is why I very much appreciated the energy that you put into a speech which, as Mrs Lulling just said on television, for example, we found clear, precise, and, I can say without the least affectation, convincing.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that I would like to say, Mr President, is that of course you are right and this has to be said here. The fears in Europe and the threats to it were certainly largely during its construction in the 1950s, but while the nature of these fears has changed, there are obviously still a great number of them today. That is why there needs to be an absolutely determined response.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy with the priorities: I will say that frankly, because they are real, and in particular the immigration policy which will be conducted by your Minister, Mr Hortefeux, our former fellow Member. Two years ago I had the honour of representing the European Parliament at the Euro-African Conference in Rabat. For the first time it brought together the countries that had the same responsibilities, whether as countries of origin, transit, or reception of immigrants, and, as Mr Watson said a moment ago, I think that it is very important, especially – and why not? – through the structure of the Union for the Mediterranean, to have a generous policy of proximity and surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one last thing, Mr President, do not forget that the reason that Europe has a unique influence throughout the world is because it is a cradle of culture; because it is culture that cements our differences; because culture is the platform for our political systems, and that is why we are viewed in a completely different way. Your energy will probably also be needed if there is to be determination in this field of culture too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only hope that Mrs Merkel will follow this example. France, the Czech Republic and Sweden have together prepared an 18-month presidency programme and I am pleased that this prioritises the issue of energy, which is absolutely key, and also the issue of reforming the common agricultural policy, because this relates to the financial framework after 2013 and thus to what money is going to be available to us in the future. I appreciate the fact that France wants to resolve these current issues and problems, because this is what worries and interests people.</p>
<p class="contents">On institutional matters, I am speaking not as a member of the PPE, but as a member of the DE, so it is probably no surprise that we shall not be in complete agreement here. I believe that we cannot stand before the Lisbon Treaty like a rabbit caught in headlights. It is not the end of the world and we do not wish to create an atmosphere of crisis, so the situation must be resolved calmly, without any political pressure, without any legal tricks and in accordance with our own rules. These rules state that no treaty can enter into force without unanimous agreement and we do not have such agreement at present. I do not believe that it is impossible to expand further without the Lisbon Treaty. I believe that Croatia at least can be accepted into the European Union without the Lisbon Treaty. Similarly I do not believe that we have to make a choice between Nice or Lisbon. We certainly have several options and we must be able to look at them soberly and without hysteria and to resolve the situation. In any case, Mr President, I wish you great success in your leadership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to clarify a few things, however. This initiative aims to reinforce the multilateral Euro-Mediterranean dimension. I believe this is right and that we should go in this direction. I think that if there is a policy that needs a critical appraisal, however, it is the neighbourhood with the southern countries, because the neighbourhood policy actually brings countries into competition with one another that are very divided. So we need to work on integration between these countries and between them and Europe, and channel resources into that as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you this openly, President-in-Office of the Council, that we really did not appreciate – and I am saying this to President Barroso as well – your stopping funding for the <span class="italic">Audiovisuel Méditerranée </span>programme, which was the only cultural co-production instrument. You have said that there is a European cultural exception but I would add, Mr President, that there is a Euro-Mediterranean cultural exception. If you consider the world’s top twenty intellectuals, in the top ten you will find many from the Muslim culture and a great many Euro-Mediterranean ones.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us help one another to put in place effective policies to change the lives of many people in these countries, especially young people and women, who place hope in Europe. We do not need good students: we need to change the reality of this relationship and Parliament is very ready to cooperate with your Presidency if you intend to move in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, the death of an immigrant in a refrigerated lorry in the Channel Tunnel, or thrown overboard from a <span class="italic">patera</span> boat heading for the Canaries – as happened just a few hours ago – is one of the greatest contemporary tragedies. It is a serious and urgent problem and the European Union needs to come up with an adequate response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Daul, spoke of the need to mobilise political will and I think that this Presidency has absolutely no shortage of political will.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, political will is necessary, but not sufficient: circumstances also count, and even if they are passing, short-term or temporary, while they exist they affect us and place limitations on us, and I welcome the fact that President Sarkozy said that we need to convert circumstances into opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that Mr Schulz is not here with us now, because when he talked about sport it brought to mind a particular circumstance. I would like the yellow jersey to be Spanish once again, as was the case in the first stage of the Tour de France.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, though, President-in-Office, that there does need to be a European dimension to sport, and several MEPs have asked me to pass a request on to you to consider whether it would be appropriate for the French sportsmen and women who are going to take part in the Olympic Games, which we have discussed here today, to wear an EU emblem next to the national flag, so that other Member States can voluntarily join in such an initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, we hope that the French Presidency will be capable of joining forces and forging consensuses so that, as you proposed, the European Union can move forward decisively under your Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is why there is a contradiction here – and you understood the key message from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament – with the fact that the social dimension of European integration has not been given the status of one of the four main priorities of your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as we have seen in recent referendums, people are questioned regarding the institutions and the treaties, but in fact they respond on the basis of the progress of European integration, and finally on Europe’s policies. I think that the imbalance that has been created in recent years between the progress of economic integration – which has been pursued and this is a good thing – and the stagnation of the social dimension, is also behind this disenchantment among the people of the Union, this disaffection towards the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the problem is not saying that Europe should get involved with all social matters, but rather that as soon as there is a single market, including a single employment market, there need to be common rules for combating disparities, which otherwise lead to social dumping, and to ensure that convergence elements are focused upwards, towards the best, rather than dragging social situations downwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has just published a social agenda, but if the Council does not commit to some concrete issues – you talked about a concrete Europe – to strengthen the powers of the European works committees, to protect temporary workers, to improve the Directive on the posting of workers so that – and this needs to be added – there is a Directive on the protection of public services and social services in the general interest, then there will not be a response to this need for protection.</p>
<p class="contents">One of your priorities is the Europe of immigration, but the Europe of immigration cannot be reduced to a Europe of expulsions. This is why we need to add to this a pact for integration, which we talked about with Mr Hortefeux – and a pact for development. You have just come from the G8; Europe and some of the Member States, including France, were accused of not fulfilling their commitments in terms of public aid for development. Ensure that during your Presidency this commitment of moving towards 0.7% of GDP is fulfilled, which will be more effective than the disgraceful ‘return directive’ in contributing towards managing international immigration more effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a difficult moment for Europe. Each of us feels this personally, including me. When I was responsible for the negotiations on my country’s accession to the European Union, I did everything I could to make sure that future European cooperation turned out well. I would also like to emphasise that today, happily, there is no problem with Polish support for the EU and for the Treaty. A considerable majority in the Polish Parliament voted in favour of the Treaty, and almost 80% of Poles are in favour of EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the assessment by the President-in-Office. We must act for and on behalf of our citizens. The priority for us politicians is an energy and climate package, but we must do all we can to ensure that its implementation does not hit Europeans with high prices and loss of competitiveness for our economy. This package needs to be adopted pretty quickly, but it would be a bad thing if speed came first and deliberation second. Our package should be the proof of our leadership in the battle against global warming. I agree that we need this, first in Poznań and later in Copenhagen; but this package will not serve as an example to anyone. No-one will follow it if the European economy loses out in its implementation. I am therefore glad that you see these hazards, President-in-Office, and that you believe that the principles of emissions trading – because that is mainly what this is about – will be restructured in good faith. We do have experience. The REACH Regulation was amended significantly in Parliament with the involvement of the Council and the Commission, to the benefit of all. We can go down that same route.</p>

I ask you to find a solution for the Irish, while respecting the will of the overwhelming majority of Europeans, which also counts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, from a social point of view, in the Lisbon Treaty there is the Charter of Fundamental Rights, there is the European social model. So for example, more than a million signatures have already been collected from disabled Europeans, who represent one in four households and are in favour of the Treaty because it eliminates secular discrimination. You therefore have support behind you to move forward and to integrate the social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding immigration, you addressed the left, but you will also recognise that left-wing governments have had ideas that have enabled you to prepare a less closed and more progressive package, which I think Parliament can improve further, but we need to work relentlessly on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Mr President – and this is directly connected with immigration – you talked about the CAP, but you did not mention Doha; it is nevertheless important for the united Europe to be able to find a solution and respond to the Millennium Goals, because it is all the same package; it is about exploiting our economic capacity in order to move all of humanity forwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone working in this institution knows how many difficulties may be encountered in moving forward with the process of development and integration, because this process has to be built between people of differing histories, cultures, social status and traditions. The politically opportunistic positions expressed just now by Mr Schulz about the present highly popular Italian Government certainly do not help. However, it is a process that must be moved forward despite the disappointments that it sometimes involves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Treaty, an excellent treaty, is on the back burner and it will require a lot of goodwill to bring it back, if we are avoid marginalising those who have not understood it. However, I do agree with what you said: before any further enlargement, we need to define new rules but without leaving Ireland out on a limb. The wave of immigration into Europe, especially into certain Member States, and mainly my own country and those in the Mediterranean area, must be regulated and viewed as a common problem rather than a reason to make distinctions or actually exploit the situation by penalising countries that are already making so many sacrifices. The people of our countries must be safeguarded and integration must be built on a reasonable basis.</p>

This is an important measure, since it provides an equal opportunity for men and women in the labour market and an opportunity for them to combine their working and family lives. Good quality, affordability and accessibility for everyone are essential for this, since it is an instrument for equal opportunities and integration.</p>

Your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole world is faced with one of the gravest economic crises in recent decades, but Europe is also facing its own crises.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that today the Europe of 27 cannot operate according to the rules of the Europe of 15. This is the institutional crisis that Europe is going through. It is also obvious that today some Member States do not want political unification for Europe, and do not want our predecessors’ vision to be realised. This is a crisis of identity. The institutional crisis will be solved, but how can the identity crisis be solved?</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid there is only one solution: the Member States that want political harmonisation should advance, and the Member States that see Europe only as an economic union should stay behind. Indeed, I am afraid that if we do not go ahead with this solution, Europe will at some point cease to be a player on the international chessboard.</p>
<p class="contents">Crises can lead to great leaps forward, but only if the necessary courage is there. I believe you have both vision and courage. Be courageous! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe you are the right President-in-Office at an extremely sensitive time, with the necessary sensitivity to people’s concerns and the determination to lead and reconcile. When you were answering the questions, you did not pass the buck, and you called a spade a spade. You do not run away, but face up to things.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to emphasise your strong commitment to parliamentary democracy. This commitment is particularly important in these times because, in several Member States – including my home country, Austria – we have been experiencing the playing off of direct democracy against parliamentary democracy and thus the incapacitation in European matters of parliaments in parliamentary democracies. Let us stand together for parliamentary democracy and against its incapacitation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to me that you have directly addressed the cowardice or, it could be said, the double standards, of many governments and members of governments in relation to their shared European responsibilities, as these double standards are one of the main causes of the lack of trust and mutual finger-pointing to which we must put a stop. We do not require everyone to be bolder, but we do require everyone to be honest and principled.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on three more issues. The first is your position on the Treaty. You are not like a rabbit caught in the headlights, you are not waiting for Ireland, but are continuing the ratification process whilst approaching Ireland. I firmly believe that we shall come to an arrangement with Ireland only after all the other 26 Member States have ratified the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not leave Croatia out on its own. I welcome your commitment to opening all the chapters by the end of the year. We also need a timetable for Macedonia. I would ask the Council to also take a decision on the Small Business Act at its December Summit, as the main competences lie with the Member States. We need legal binding and not just another public political statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People did not understand it; the Government has been in power since 1994; politicians are appearing at tribunals of enquiry; the main government and opposition parties – the political establishment – wanted it passed. There were fears concerning defence and conscription, abortion and euthanasia – accompanied by syringes circulated by Members of this House – taxation, jobs, immigration. Much of this was led by the extremes on the right and on the left.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the Lisbon Treaty, there is not enough diplomatic encouragement for ratification.

National-populism is the most alarming expression of this phenomenon, and is also behind the propaganda in favour of the Irish ‘no’, the racist xenophobia in Italy, but also the rhetoric on the national nature of social policies. Either Europe will be social or it will collapse. I hope that the French Presidency will be sensitive to this side of things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that this is not at all a surprise to me. I was entirely convinced that it was very good news that France was to take on the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council during this particularly difficult period. Of course, President Sarkozy and all of us would have preferred the horizon to be clearer from an institutional point of view, but I think that it is precisely during these difficult times that we can see the political capacity and measure the full importance of a strong political will.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of this democratic political debate. I have said many times that we need to acknowledge politically the differences and multiple points of view that exist, for example here in Parliament. We need to know how to express these differences because Europe is different from a national political system. In our democratic national systems, each time that there is a political discussion, even sometimes one that is very polarised, we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the State, while very often in Europe when those of us who are for Europe strongly express these objections, we have to confront those who are against Europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the European project.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is why we really need to be able to express all these points of view, but while strengthening the pro-Europe camp during this particularly difficult time. Let us be clear, we have the European elections in June 2009. If the different European political forces and European institutions do not work hand in hand with a constructive position, we will be giving arguments to those who, at the extremes, want to exploit populism, xenophobia and nationalism by establishing a connection between nationalism and homeland, which is an error. Moreover, I often quote a great French author, who said that ‘Patriotism is love for one’s own people; nationalism is hatred of others.’</p>
<p class="contents">We can love our homeland and, at the same time, defend our European project with conviction, as President Sarkozy said just now. I therefore hope that the debate that takes place over the next six months will strengthen the European institutions as well as our project for the Europe of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to answer a specific question. It is the only specific question that I was asked, and I will of course leave the rest to President Sarkozy, who is in a much better position than me to deal with them. This specific question was from Mrs Napolitano regarding the Euromed cultural programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to inform you that the current programme, the Euromed cultural programme, still has an allocation of EUR 15 million for this year. For 2009-2010 it is true that nothing has been decided yet, but there is a great deal of pressure on external expenditure, and in these cases, what happens, quite frankly, is that the third countries concerned tend to prioritise bilateral cooperation to the detriment of regional budgets. It is therefore an issue that should be discussed with the Euromed countries. Indeed, one of the interesting aspects of France’s initiative aimed at creating a Union for the Mediterranean <span class="bold">− </span>which, for that matter, I supported from the very start <span class="bold">−</span> is that it brings a stronger element of regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I am asked what the Union for the Mediterranean adds to the Barcelona process. It is, of course, an element of greater political appropriation, and is also political upgrading, in particular thanks to the biennial summit; but it is also the dimension brought by specific regional projects and, now I also hope, by very specific projects to which we will be able to add a stronger private sector dimension, as we still need more resources.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is the specific area in which we are working and, to conclude, I would just like to say: ‘Good luck France, and good luck my dear friend President Sarkozy!’.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Sarkozy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would first like to say that I think it is natural, when one has the honour of being the President-in-Office of the Council, to be before Parliament for as many hours as Parliament wishes, not only on the first day of the Presidency, but rather I will say to you, President of the European Parliament, as well as to each of the group chairmen and to the Conference of Presidents, if you want me to come at particular times during the Presidency, I am at Parliament’s disposal. You have to play the game of the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is at the heart of parliamentary democracy. It is not a question of availability; it is a question of priority. The Presidency needs the European Parliament and is therefore at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the speakers will excuse me, I would like to say a few words to each of them. First of all I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews that I am among those who think that Europe needs the United Kingdom. I have never been one of those Europeans or French people who thought that we should be wary of our British friends. The United Kingdom can bring much more than it believes it can to Europe. The United Kingdom is the gateway to the Anglo-Saxon world, it represents the leading world language and it is economically dynamic, as has been shown in recent years. I would like to say to our British Conservative friends, ‘believe that Europe needs you, that you have a place there, and that if the British have one foot in and one foot out, Europe will be weakened’. The United Kingdom is a great nation. It has nothing to fear from Europe, and Europe has a great deal to expect from the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Poignant, who saw deep inside me and therefore understood that I loved politics and that Parliament was a little like my garden, I would like to say that yes, Parliament is the place for democracy, and I do not respect or understand those political leaders who would not be happy to express and defend their ideas in the cradle of parliamentary democracy. I hope that in your remark there was an element of regret, rather than an excessive view of the harmonisation of the employment market.</p>
<p class="contents">The same also applies to Mr Désir; I am entirely with you, I am against complete harmonisation because the people would reject it. However, having minimum rules in the context of an employment market, in the context of a single economic market, is perfectly natural.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us all be aware of the difficulties. Take Austria, for example, which is led by a socialist Prime Minister and Government; they will tell you that the retirement age is 65, and that the contribution period is 45 years. You are aware of how many difficulties I encountered in bringing the contribution period to 40 years, and I did not immediately gain the support of the French Socialist Party.</p>
<p class="contents">So explain to me how it is, when I encountered so many difficulties in securing a 40-year contribution period in France, I only need to be President of Europe for six months to preferably achieve between the 45 years of contributions in Austria and the 40 years in France. How can that be done? It is a long way from the dream to the reality, but this is perhaps the difference between the French Socialist Party and the European Socialist Party. At times I even feel closer to the European Socialist Party than to the French Socialist Party; I confess my fault and of course apologise for it.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As you know, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that we are wasting time because I think that democracy at European level can be free of the violence that it sometimes has at national level. The European level enables everyone to step back a little from the electoral routine, which is brutal, often unfair and always difficult. Finally, the fact that in a forum such as yours we can talk while smiling and respecting each other is perhaps also something that will encourage people to warm to the European ideal and make it their own. In any case I do not see this as wasted time, and I would like Mr Poignant and Mr Schulz to be certain of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Sarnez is quite right. We need to change our development policy, making food agriculture a priority. It is entirely essential; the African countries need to have the resources to become self-sufficient in terms of food, and undoubtedly part of the money that we have dedicated to developing large infrastructures needs to be invested in agricultural micro-projects. This is a point on which I fully share your opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">You also called on me to defend a vision of Europe. I share this ambition. I hope that you will be generous enough to advise me on the content of that vision. You are perfectly aware that, again, between the somewhat disembodied big ideal and all of the technical issues of daily life, the problem for each of us is having to constantly decide on what to do about the big ideas that sometimes go far beyond the day-to-day difficulties experienced by our citizens, and what to do about resolving the technical issues that affect their daily lives. It is not that simple, but I will try my hand at it in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer you, Mr Crowley, yes we do need development in order to avoid illegal immigration. Moreover, everyone is aware that the best response to the immigration issue is development. There are 475 million young Africans who are under the age of 17, and there are 12 km of the Strait of Gibraltar between Europe and Africa. Africa’s disasters will be Europe’s disasters, and there are no barriers or borders that can resist that. We therefore do indeed need a development policy. Again it is very difficult to decide between multilateralism and bilateralism. This is a significant subject and I intend to devote a great deal of attention to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Irujo talked about linguistic diversity. I am entirely in agreement, including – and I understand that you do not like the expression ‘regional language’ – with regard to official languages. I am among those, you see, who think that we would be helping all the pro-autonomy or independence movements by giving them the monopoly on defending regional languages, and this would be a very serious error. I am talking about Corsica, in the French Republic, where there are people who are Corsican, who love Corsica, and who speak Corsican in their villages; but that is no threat to national unity. Therefore, linguistic diversity is, in my eyes, just as important as cultural diversity, and in any case there will be no cultural diversity if there is only one language.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Farage, I very much liked your speech, but I am going to say one thing to you: the British were quite happy for me to close Sangatte, because it was in fact me who closed Sangatte, and it was you who asked me to. Even if you are a British person who loves his country, you cannot resolve all its immigration problems, and I have to tell you that France does not intend to be the United Kingdom’s border guard. Allow me to say that it is all very well to say, ‘in my country I do not want identity cards and I do not want a common immigration policy’, but this does not stop you from being quite happy for foreigners whose papers are not in order to be stopped in France so that you do not have them in the United Kingdom. Just like France, the United Kingdom cannot manage alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, Mr Farage, that I respect the Polish, but you were not in my office negotiating the Lisbon Treaty with a number of colleagues. We were in Brussels, and who was in my office? Not Prime Minister Tusk, because the Prime Minister at that time was Mr Kaczynski’s brother. There was President Kaczynski and I will say one thing: he is a man that I trust and he is a man that I respect. However, in Europe, when you sign something, if you start by not respecting it, there is no more Europe, there is nothing at all, there are no negotiations. When one of us commits his country, in Brussels, he must make a commitment at home as well. I said that, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is completely respectful of the Polish: Mr Farage, I think that I defended Poland. President Barroso will be able to say this better than anyone. We need Poland, but we also need to have respect for a man’s word when it is given.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sudre, thank you for your support. I entirely agree with your analysis and sincerely thank you for it. Mr Rasmussen, who I understood was Rasmussen I, and I am just about clear who Rasmussen II is, I would like to say that Denmark is a good example of a country that has been able to move forward, and that enables me to respond to all the speakers on the Irish issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we should not force the hands of the Irish and we need to respect them, but we need to have the courage to say to our Irish friends: ‘You also need to respect the other countries that have ratified the Treaty. We are not lecturing you, but consider that others also have an opinion to offer and that at some point we will have to find a common path. Europe does not want to continue without you, but Europe cannot come to a halt just because of you.’ I say this with all the respect I have for a country that has voted ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the French, have caused you considerable problems and difficulties, but at some point we need to get out of this situation in which everyone is watching each other and waiting for someone else to take the initiative. The French Presidency, along with the Presidency of the Commission and the Presidency of the European Parliament need to take the initiative. After that, some will say yes and some will say no. Personally, I think that there is a solution, but it is certainly not in maintaining the status quo or in saying ‘we will wait and let time do the work’. Personally I think that time works against us, that Europe has been waiting for years and that there is no point in it waiting any longer. We will find a solution; I am convinced, just as the Danish found one.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Mehrin, I was very touched by your assessment of me as a ‘ladies' man’. I will leave the content with you; I honestly do not know exactly what it means and I will be careful not to go down that road as I would not like you to misunderstand me. I know that the multi-speed Europe does exist. We are not all in the euro, and we are not all in Schengen. However, ultimately, before we build a multi-speed institutional Europe, I would like us to try to do it all together. Do not criticise the Presidency for having the ambition to take everyone along because, if before we have even started, Madam, we say, ‘In any case, it does not matter, let us leave it’, then one day we are negotiating a social exception for the British, the next we are negotiating an institutional exception for the Irish, and the next we will be negotiating an exception for the Polish. At that point I fear that we will get to a situation in which all the countries will, quite rightly, ask for an exception, and where will the European Union be then? Where will the project be that the founding fathers baptised? This is what I am saying. Perhaps we will have to get to that point, but I would like us to get there after we have tried to take the whole family along together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to those who are concerned about Croatia that I am of course in favour of us continuing the negotiations, and I think that it would be a serious mistake to close Europe’s door to the Balkans, because the Balkans need the peace and democracy that the Union can bring them, but I will not go back to the Lisbon debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Bielan that I do not wish to threaten Ireland; besides, I would not be able to do so and it would not even occur to me to do so. I will go there and listen but, at the same time, everyone needs to understand that in the polls 80% of the people say that they are pro-Europe; we can nevertheless work with them without threatening them.</p>
<p class="contents">VAT on fuel is a French proposal; I do not want to impose it on anyone. I would simply like to draw your attention to the fact that I am convinced that the price of oil is going to continue to rise. We need to have the courage to say this to our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is 3% less oil production each year due to stocks being exhausted, and 2 to 3% more oil consumption, due to the growth of emerging countries. My thought is simply that VAT is a tax that is proportional to price. If tomorrow oil is 175 dollars per barrel, will we be able to continue, without saying anything, to collect 20% tax on rocketing oil prices? This is the question that I want to ask. Along with the Presidency of the Commission, we will report on this in October. I will try to push it in the direction of my convictions, and we will see what the result is.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Ukraine, there will be a summit, and we will move things forward. We need to encourage Ukraine along the road to democracy and we need to bring it closer to the European Union. Ukraine is not insignificant, it has 42 million inhabitants. This is not a small decision. For now we are at the point of association, but anyone who walks through the streets of Kiev can see that it is a European capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Langen, I would like to thank you for your compliments, which really touched me. I rather liked the reference to Tony Blair. I do not know if this is the reason that you made the reference, but I think that Tony Blair is one of the statesmen who have done a great deal for Europe, and a great deal for his country, and frankly I do not know if he would mind me saying this, but in many areas I find that he has restored credit and strength to the British political debate and to the European political debate. I think that in Europe, we need leaders and that in his time Tony Blair was indisputably one of those leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">This is going to mark me out as being more towards the left, even though I have observed that compliments are not always forthcoming for Mr Blair from that side of the political spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr Goebbels, others do need to make an effort, and this is entirely the issue that will be raised in the negotiations on climate change, but Europe needs to set an example. I am not naïve in saying that. I think that we have more credibility when we practise what we preach. Some might say that it is better to wait. Personally I think that we need to take the risk of acting. Fundamentally, Mr Goebbels, my political philosophy is that nothing is worse than inaction. The worst risk is to take no risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cavada, you are quite right, we need to respond to these fears. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Union for the Mediterranean, I would like to say that in my mind, following on from President Barroso, there is no criticism of the Barcelona Process. I would nevertheless like to say one thing. Barcelona was a very good idea, but there was one problem at the Barcelona Summit. As far as I remember, there was just one Arab head of state, Prime Minister Abu Mazen. How do you think we can create a Union for the Mediterranean, bringing the northern and southern shores closer together, if the southern shore does not come?</p>
<p class="contents">At the Paris Summit, I believe, although Bernard Kouchner may correct me later, that all of the Arab heads of state will be present. This may be a minor difference, but to me it is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to Mr Zahradil that it is not a question of creating a crisis regarding Lisbon, but we should also not act as if nothing is happening. We should not dramatise, but at the same time it is nevertheless worrying that the last three referendums in the European Union ended in a no vote, which was certainly for other reasons, but the fact remains that at the very least it is not a particularly encouraging sign.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not respond to Mrs Napoletano as President Barroso gave you a good answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sánchez-Neyra, yes there does need to be a European dimension to sport and I think that it could only be beneficial if the statistics for the Olympic Games were counted nation by nation, but if there were a specific column for European medals. This would be a way of showing that we also exist in the Europe of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Désir, I answered you regarding standards in the labour market. Regarding social policy, we have a famous debate. The 35-hour week is not enough to win the elections, or to have a genuine social policy. I would like to add that the reason why I took so much trouble in overcoming the automatic, rigid code of the 35-hour week in France was precisely in the name of European harmonisation, because no other country had followed you along that path. None. Not a single one. Including the European socialist governments. Therefore, you see, I am quite happy for us to call for social harmonisation, but I would like to say to our French socialist friends that social harmonisation involves not advocating ideas in France that no one else is advocating in Europe, because that is an exception and our country is suffering as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Buzek for Poland’s European commitment. I have never ever doubted Poland’s European commitment. Poland is one of the six most populated countries in Europe, and this is precisely why I say to President Kaczynski that we need his signature, because Poland is not just any European country. It is extremely important, it is a symbol, and naturally we need to reduce the institutional crisis solely to the issue of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo, Doha, yes I said it to President Barroso, I said it to Gordon Brown, but in short, Doha, but not at any price. I would like to defend two ideas that are close to my heart. First of all, I am told that if there is no agreement, there will be no growth. Excuse me, but there has not been an agreement for seven years, and for six years the world has undergone unprecedented growth. The WTO agreement is preferable to having no agreement, but it should not be said that without an agreement there can be no growth. For six years we have had growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what President Barroso, the Canadian Prime Minister and even Angela Merkel are currently saying is that it is not good enough. Brazil is not making any effort regarding lowering tariff barriers in the industry; there is no effort on services. Also, what can be said about the closure of the Chinese market? There is no French exception from this point of view. Firstly, as President-in-Office of the Council, I must loyally defend the Union’s position. However, in terms of the Union’s position, I have not heard anyone, even the British Government, saying that the agreement should be signed at the current stage of the negotiations. We are therefore unanimous in Europe, even if it is not for the same reasons, in saying that as things stand, it is not good enough; that Europe has made all the effort and it cannot continue to make efforts if the other big regions of the world are not committed to moving forward. From this point of view, I think that we are all in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Zappalà that I thank him for his support for the European immigration policy, and to Mrs Gurmai that I think that equality between men and women is very important, but I do not know whether her remark was addressed to me as well. In any case, the fact that she is Hungarian is already an undeniable asset.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Varvitsiotis that I am perfectly aware that there is a European identity crisis, and perhaps also that the European Parliament could help all the institutions with this issue. Why not imagine that there is a real debate, President Pöttering, on what European identity is? This subject of European identity is a subject for European parliamentary debate, rather than a matter for a head of state or government. Perhaps the European Parliament could even organise debates on this subject, and in that case we will come and give our opinion. Personally I think it is more the role of Parliament to define European identity rather than the role of governments, who naturally deal with daily administration in each of their countries. If there is indeed a place where European identity should be defined, I think, and I hope that President Barroso will agree, it is not in the European Council, or the Commission, but first of all in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to Mr Karas, who said that I need to demonstrate diplomacy. Yes, understood, I will try to be diplomatic. I hope that on his part he was not questioning whether my temperament would prevent me from being diplomatic. It is not simply a question of being weak yet clever, or being dynamic yet clumsy. Perhaps it is even possible to be both dynamic and skilful but, in any event, thank you for giving me the opportunity to demonstrate this.</p>

We must find the strength and skill to relaunch a European path that must revive the enthusiasm and emotion of citizens, who still perceive the EU as something distant and rather abstruse. I also take this opportunity to offer a provocation to the President-in-Office: to bring citizens closer to the EU, concrete signals must be sent out. It would be excellent if the French President could start a serious debate on sorting out the issue of Parliament’s two seats: let us concentrate all activities in Brussels and avoid the monthly move to Strasbourg (where the site could be used for other purposes, such as the centre of technological excellence): this ‘trip’ actually represents a huge and unjustified waste of financial and energy resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The French Presidency supports the ‘six-plus-five’ rule in sport: a restriction on the number of foreign players. The objectives are good: obliging clubs to invest more in their own youth training and thus also going some way towards restoring the competitive balance. This Parliament agrees with this one hundred per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our support for the ‘home-grown’ rule, which – albeit more modestly – has the same objectives in mind. The question is whether the six-plus-five rule is feasible at European level. It conflicts with the free movement of workers and can only be applied if a derogation is made from the EU Treaty, and we are a long way from this course of action. It is doubtful whether the Court of Justice would ever accept such a thing, even in the light of the new article on sport in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament want to join in the search for a solution that benefits European football. We are simply calling for a solid solution, one that does not plunge football into chaos. Nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, if a majority of the Irish people rejected it then the Treaty is dead in the water. Ratifications should not continue. Insisting on ratification of the Treaty is an anti-democratic attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority is deepening immigration policy, where the return directive, otherwise known as the shameful directive, stands out due to its disregard of fundamental human rights and its treatment of illegal immigrants as criminals and not as people who have fled hunger in their countries, looking for a better future for themselves and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The social area was totally overlooked.

<p class="contents">I should like at this juncture to stress the considerable significance of agriculture for the European Community. In Poland, for example, in 2005 over 17% of employed people were working in agriculture. The agricultural issue is of indirect importance to Member States – here I am chiefly thinking of the problem of food security in the context of rising food product prices on the world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the French Presidency will bring a solution to several disputed questions relating to the European agricultural model. Europe does not have such a good climate or agrarian conditions to be able to give up support for its farmers altogether. The cost of producing meat, milk or cereals will always be higher on our continent than in South America, the United States or Australia. We need to bear in mind that these countries too support their farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that higher agricultural product prices are creating a development opportunity for European agriculture. There is a danger, though, that the additional income will be intercepted by intermediate agencies; in other words, a rise in food prices causes a disproportionate rise in the cost of the agricultural production method. The result is that the surplus income is absorbed by intermediate agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture continues to be an important economic sector. The conditions under which it currently functions have changed, but the main priorities – ensuring a decent level of income for farmers and food security – are still there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It would certainly be scandalous if the Member States that did not reduce but rather increased their emissions between 1990 and 2005 now received a reward from the European Union and continued to keep the advantage they have that is contradictory to the Kyoto Protocol.

It is true that we must consider how to get Europe out of its crisis. It is little consolation that virtually the whole world finds itself in a situation that is close to critical. This has a significant economic and social dimension. I am talking about the threat of hunger in many regions of the world, since food prices are rising steeply, about energy security and also about the status of the environment. The world’s financial system is becoming increasingly unstable. Why am I placing emphasis on this? Because it is not for us to be self-righteous. The almost 500 million citizens of the EU currently constitute less than 8% of the world’s population, and in 40 years’ time this proportion will be barely at the election threshold – 5%. Our European view must therefore not overlook values of a higher order linked to the maintenance of Euro-Atlantic civilisation. This also has an ethical dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In each country of the EU, then, we need due care for the family, which, while being a tiny community, is at the same time the cornerstone of the whole European Community. We should not let this slip from our view. If we do, we shall lose touch, as we are doing now, by abusing the word ‘marriage’ in applying it to unions that are not marriage. It is true that we need new legal frameworks, but they must be ones that people can understand. EU citizens are the subject of actions taken by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We are merely carrying out a service. It is precisely in this light that we view the case of Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unexpectedly for most observers, though, the principal character at the start of the French Presidency is Poland or, to be precise, not so much Poland as the Polish President, Lech Kaczyński. I do not understand the arguments deployed by the President of Poland in declining to sign the ratification documents for the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty was ratified by the Sejm and by the Senate. Nothing has happened to delay the appending of the President’s signature. The Treaty has not, for example, been referred to the Constitutional Tribunal. This looks like disrespect for Parliament and violation of an agreement with the Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. I agree with the President-in-Office that this matter is not by nature political, but ethical. Poland negotiated the Treaty, signed it, and under international law is obliged to go through with the ratification process. I also very much hope that the situation regarding ratification of the Treaty will change soon and that attitudes will be significantly better by the end of the French Presidency than they are at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this says above all that the challenges of climate change are at last at the heart of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to remind the President-in-Office of the Council of the seriousness of the task – emissions trading is a very significant market tool and affects so many people that we cannot afford to aspire to the kind of political timetable which goes on at the expense of the environment and sustainable development. Otherwise France may end up with egg on its face, something of which it could not be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month I held a seminar at which environmental organisations, research bodies and bodies affected by emissions trading were able to express their views on its economic effects. The message I received was clear: the Commission proposal will result in much higher costs without providing comparable environmental benefit. I refer to the worrying McKinsey analysis of the matter. Emissions trading must be improved. The situation is serious. We will not be able to use European industry, which has been dealing with its own affairs well, as a guinea pig again unless the system is operated in a slip-shod fashion. It is better to fail to accomplish than to accomplish failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can deliver a good result in time, but some vital adjustments are required. Carbon emissions will not be prevented by pious hopes and promises, unless they become part of the directive itself. We should remain firm on reducing the obligation but the procedure is very much open to discussion. In Parliament we have presented a broad front to the way the Commission has approached the alternatives under consideration. I would ask that you become acquainted with it, President-in-Office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The pact on immigration is a necessary priority in order to diminish illegal immigration and build a common policy on legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize an aspect you should take into consideration before starting the planned actions: the pact should comprise a series of actions taking into account the restrictions on the European labour market, imposed on workers from certain new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not normal for the economic migration from third countries to outmatch the free movement between countries inside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are Member States that have transitory provisions in force, regulating access to the labour market for EU workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the legal immigration policy is enforced, there is a risk of disadvantaging European citizens as compared to third country citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to congratulate France, which has taken the first step in this direction on 1 July, when it opened its labour market for the citizens of the countries acceding in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope Romania and Bulgaria shall receive the same treatment as soon as possible and I encourage the other Member States to follow the example of France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year saw the beginning of the environment and energy action plan to reduce greenhouse gases and combat climate warming. We have discussed a common immigration policy for Europe and a short time ago heard testimony on the huge growth in illegal migration. We have also tackled issues of protection: joint European forces have been carrying out military operations in the wider world and since 2004 we have created EU battle groups and emergency response units.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Presidency in the person of President Nicolas Sarkozy has brought freshness and promise to European policy, has given us the idea of a mini-agreement, and has taken a new approach to the new Member States. There are many examples of this. Through his own drive and initiative he will certainly be able to launch or speed up many challenging projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of this I wish to stress that the country holding the Presidency does not drive European affairs separately, although it does have the right to propose certain items for the order of business. The fact that the Presidency is not responsible for decisions taken at the European Council table is a fundamental matter for it, and one on which it should focus its Presidency, rather than a party festooned with empty promises. Above all I hope very much that the French Presidency is able to inspire hope in Europeans for specific projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My dear Jo, if you will return to your seat. I will explain the problem that we have, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Rule 149 states that we can establish whether a quorum is present. As you know there are always large numbers in Parliament to debate its agenda and adopt the minutes, so in that case no quorum is required. However, Rule 149(3) states that if there is a prior request from at least forty Members, we can establish whether or not the quorum is present.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a written request from forty Members who want us to verify whether or not the quorum is present. Therefore, obviously... Mr Posselt, please allow me to explain the facts. Obviously I consider that there is indeed a prior request that has been clearly made.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is as follows: after that the Rules of Procedure are much vaguer. It does not say anywhere that the forty Members have to be present in the Chamber in order to submit this request for the quorum to be established, but it is also not excluded. I therefore have discretion. On previous occasions, which we have checked, the President of the sitting has always considered that the forty Members had to be in the Chamber in order to give some substance to Rule 149(4), which states that when the quorum is counted, the forty should be counted. That implies that the forty have to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have discretion, and there is also the way in which the request is worded: it concerns the vote on urgencies, which is all the urgencies; not just one of them but all of them. If we consider that the quorum request is admissible and the quorum is not present, all the urgencies will be dropped, and as you know they cannot be deferred. This means that we will not vote on Kashmir, the death penalty or Bangladesh. If we do not vote on them, we will not defer them to the next sitting. Parliament will not decide on these issues that are said to be urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">Before giving my opinion, I would therefore particularly like to have the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. Mr Leinen, in your view, should I consider that the forty petitioners should be present in the Chamber as Rule 149(4) implies, or can I consider that a prior written request alone is sufficient, as Rule 149(3) implies? I shall listen closely to your reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quorum shall exist if one third of Parliament’s Members are present in the Chamber. The President responds to such a request by establishing whether or not the quorum exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Then comes paragraph 4, which you mentioned, which states that ‘Members who have asked for the quorum to be established shall be counted as being present […], even if they are no longer in the Chamber.’ We are presently in a sitting that has resumed and, in my view, Members who were present and said they wanted the quorum established should be counted as present even if they are not here in plenary this afternoon. That is how I understand paragraph 4.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear that you have received a request from 40 Members of this House for you to establish this afternoon whether the quorum is present or not. You can look around – one third of 785 is a little over 200, and there are about 30 of us here. Try as we might, we are unlikely to reach 200 this afternoon unless everybody turns up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we can discuss the matter but, if you determine that the number of Members present does not reach one third, then we cannot vote. That is what the Rules of Procedure say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They used to be held on Fridays, then they moved to Thursday afternoons. All the groups regularly used to try the trick of making a request like this if there was some urgent matter that did not suit them, like the topic of Kashmir in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Rules of Procedure were amended and the stipulation introduced that 40 Members – it may not be formulated very clearly, but that was the intention of the reform – have to be in the Chamber and contest the quorum. It was introduced because we were aware of the problem and, since then, there has never been the required number of Members present in the Chamber to request that the quorum be established, so it was always deemed to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important legally to consider the intention of this rule. I am sure it can be looked up in the committee and plenary Minutes. The intention of the reform was to link the question of the quorum with a number of Members present that was high enough to prevent it becoming a frequent parlour game, for that would almost have ruined these debates.

As my colleague has already said, it is true that this manoeuvre appears to be a little dilatory; in other words forty of our colleagues who, for reasons that are their concern, have not been able to attend this sitting, are trying to use measures and procedures in order to prevent an urgent debate taking place here this afternoon. I really think that perhaps, rather than scrupulously applying the rules, we should look at the spirit of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of the Rules of Procedure is really to ensure that the people who are tabling this quorum request are at least present so that they themselves can establish that there is no quorum. Otherwise, I find that the request is either a political manoeuvre or it is tactical, but it is dilatory. I would not wish, by strictly applying the law, for us to end up in the position where the urgent debates regularly organised on a Thursday afternoon, which are important, ended up being ‘avoided’, which would not enhance Parliament’s work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought I understood Mr Leinen in reading out the Rules – and he will correct me if I am wrong – to imply that the Members should at least be here at the beginning of the sitting, even if they then leave. Any other interpretation surely would be entirely self-serving, because people who are absent can put in a demand to say that there is no quorum, but they have helped to ensure that there is no quorum! I cannot see how it could possibly be right to conclude that they can be entirely absent and say that the rest of us do not form a quorum.</p>

We know there is never a quorum for the urgencies and, if is suddenly to be invoked now, that may be a problem with the Rules that we will have to sort out. If you are going to torpedo this afternoon’s urgencies, you could torpedo every Thursday afternoon’s urgencies.</p>

<p class="contents">The tactic we are witnessing is obviously an unfair one and I believe that a demand by Members who are not present in the room cannot be considered. Furthermore, I should like to call on those Members who are more expert at preparing amendments to the Rules, namely Mr Leinen, and Mr Corbett as well, to prepare an amendment to this rule, stipulating the following: if there is a request for a quorum count and if the person who made the request is not present in the Chamber at the time the count is carried out, they will lose their <span class="italic">per diem </span>for that day, and all those who are not in the Chamber, if there is no quorum the count establishes that, shall lose half their <span class="italic">per diem </span>for that day, so that we can put paid to this type of tactic once and for all.

The way in which the request from the forty petitioners is worded does not mention the issue of Kashmir, but all the urgencies, all the urgencies this afternoon, including the death penalty. This is an important matter. We can have the debates without any problem, Mrs Gill is right. The issue solely concerns the vote, but I wanted to have this debate from the start so that there would not be ambiguity all afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the reason why Parliament took the trouble to write Rule 149(4), stating that the Members who have asked for the quorum to be checked shall be counted, in accordance with paragraph 2, even if they are not in the Chamber, as Mr Posselt said, I think that this Rule was written solely to prevent Members from leaving the Chamber at the time of the count, which implies that they were present at the start of the count.</p>
<p class="contents">As I cannot see that the forty petitioners are present at the start of the count – unless, as Mrs Gill says, they are all present later at voting time, which we will check, in which case there will be a quorum request – I will follow the precedents set by the other presidents of sittings who, like me, have been faced with this problem, by saying that the quorum request cannot be validated because the forty petitioners are not present.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Mr Leinen was right to draw our attention to the fact that the way in which paragraph 4 is written could cause confusion. This is why I think that this is a very good time – and it is not up to me to decide this, but to the competent bodies – for the Committee that you chair, Jo, to clarify very quickly whether or not paragraph 3 states that the Members have to be present when they submit their quorum request, and whether or not the Members have to be present when the count is done, at the start of the count. I think that the interpretation of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will get us out of a tricky situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as far as today is concerned, given the importance of the debates, and given the opinions that you have given me, which clearly largely support what I have just said, and on the basis of the previous decisions, we are going to have our debates, and when it comes to the vote, if the forty petitioners are not present, I will not ask for the quorum to be checked.

<p class="contents">Commissioner, thousands of civilians have been the victims of extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, torture, rape and other serious human rights abuses which have occurred in Jammu and Kashmir since the beginning of the armed conflict there in 1989. Shamefully, most of these crimes have not been fully resolved to date. Furthermore, there is real concern about the safety of human rights activists, including those who are seeking to investigate the fate of the many missing persons.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament strongly condemns all acts involving human rights abuses in the region and calls upon all governments concerned to show a strong will to uphold the rule of law and justice and to redouble their efforts in order to secure full investigations into the politically motivated crimes committed in Jammu and Kashmir in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I class this as discrimination and something that is totally unacceptable. I shall be submitting an appropriate letter on this, Mr President. This is a very disturbing thing.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this situation, we are not looking at a black-and-white film. On the border between India and Pakistan conflicts arise that are often provoked by the Pakistani state, as we very well know. We know about the so-called line of control guarded by the armed forces of the two countries. Following the recent 20-year period of peace along this border, Pakistan has resumed its attacks on the state of Kashmir. I am therefore asking for attention to be given to the other side too. Of course, I am not underestimating the issue of the graves that we are discussing here, although the number of victims is probably considerably smaller there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore this motion for a resolution – along with the hearing in the Subcommittee on Human Rights next week – takes on an even greater significance because of the political and security situation in the area. As this House well knows, we have ourselves debated that general situation before, perhaps also under less than transparent conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a history of disappearances in the region. We know that a number of these have been linked to the activities of the security forces. We know that it is the most heavily militarised area in the world. We know that this also is an area where there are arrests and significant detention without trial. Therefore that also colours our interpretation of such findings, making it all the more important that there should be a really open investigation allowing full transparency and full access for the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Union will, as the resolution states, offer its support for high-quality forensic expertise and any other assistance which is needed in this investigation, because it is important for our interpretation of what is happening there that we reach the fullest possible understanding. With that also goes – as others have said – the protection of human rights activists who are themselves trying to investigate the issue, such as Pervez Imroz.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we would all agree that it is the duty of all democratically elected governments to investigate such findings fully in complete transparency, and to try and trace those whose bodies are there and their relatives, so that we can fully understand the situation and not apply various interpretations to it which might not be the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament is absolutely right to be discussing this issue, and absolutely right to be calling on the Commission to offer its assistance, particularly given the ongoing problems that we are seeing in the region at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for the matter in hand, India has been called the world’s largest democratic State. It is indeed large in terms of population but the idea of whether a country is democratic also depends on its human rights situation. Measures alleged to have been taken by the government’s security services against human rights activists in Jammu and Kashmir indicate that not all principles of the rule of law are respected in India, despite the fact that the country’s government has clearly declared that it does not allow violations of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard the action of the Indian government as lacking in credibility and ask where thousands of people have disappeared to and whose are the bodies found in the mass graves. We condemn forced disappearances, torture, rape and other violations of human rights. The fact that we suspect the Indian government of having a part in all this is an especially serious matter. Therefore we in the European Parliament demand that an independent investigation be carried out by the Indian government to identify the origin of the mass graves and the identities of the murderers and their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter is not insignificant given the nature of the Kashmir region. There is a risk that the neighbouring state, Pakistan, would be party to any new conflict and in that case the events in question may act as a spark to nationalist kindling in this explosive area. We must support the joint resolution on a thorough investigation into the events which occurred in Jammu and Kashmir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was hoped that the situation would ease. Alas, the domestic political crises in both nations have brought a renewed hardening and we, the European Parliament, are working very hard to get the situation moving again.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mr Gahler, who, as Chief Observer of our Elections Observation Mission in Pakistan, has worked so hard for democracy in Pakistan and to ensure that our contacts with India serve the same goal and that we are supporting confidence-building.</p>
<p class="contents">One might wonder why we are addressing mass graves, as this will not bring the dead back to life and may worsen the climate between the two countries. We are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims – and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports. There are victims on both sides, and the main victim is the Kashmiri people. That is why we must investigate these mass graves, we must determine where the many people are who have disappeared and are being mourned by their families. Only then can the confidence be established that is necessary for a truly peaceful solution that people also feel they are part of.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir belongs first and foremost to the Kashmiri people themselves. We should therefore support a solution that finally gives the Kashmiris some breathing space, finally creates political freedom and provides a sensible compromise solution, for this is one of the longest-running conflicts of all. It has been raging since the Second World War, and it is scandalous that nobody has yet managed to bring the problem under control.</p>

I do not know who has put my name down because I have not signed it.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say that I am really surprised to see this item as an urgency before we have debated it properly in either the Subcommittee on Human Rights, or for that matter, any other subcommittee or delegation of this Parliament. This is not a new issue and it has been extensively investigated by the media in India. It has been raised over and over again. It would have been good to have had the debate before. This is the reason that the Socialist Group were against having this item as an urgency now because we believed it should have been properly discussed in committee before.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole urgency is based on reports by a single NGO. I am not denying that these things are happening, but I have had communication with the Commission, who are calling into question various things in this report. So I would really question what it does for this Parliament’s credibility to have an urgency before things are properly investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chairwoman of the European Parliament’s Delegation for relations with India, I personally would have liked an opportunity to look at the contents of this report and examine how many cases we are looking at and the result of the conflict in the region, where there have already been something like 4 500 deaths among military personnel and 13 000 civilians have lost their lives. The graves we are talking about are in the line of control.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution text ignores the fact that the issue has been investigated over the last five years, following the 2002 elections, and I have been informed that NGOs have had access to the area and have been invited to submit their names of disappeared persons to help the authorities to identify the graves. Nobody is denying that security forces have been involved in disappearances. What this resolution leaves out is that they have been investigated by the authorities. I personally would urge this House not to vote for this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is nothing of the sort. It is a simple focus on humanitarian questions, with a call for an independent and impartial investigation and accountability for alleged disappearances.</p>
<p class="contents">It could have been handled in various ways. It is true that these discoveries of unidentified graves go back to 2006. But two things prompted the urgency request. One was the report going back to 29 March from the Association of the Parents of Disappeared Persons and the second was the attack on 30 June, with perpetrators unknown, on Pervez Imroz, the award-winning human rights lawyer and founder of that association. I think that justifies the urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">At least part of the purpose of this resolution is to urge some action by the European Union, not least in paragraph 2, which urges the Commission to offer financial and technical assistance to the Indian Government. It also calls for EU Member States to take up the issue in the dialogue on human rights with the Indian Government in the second half of this year. So the focus is on getting an independent investigation and not least to assign a civilian prosecutor to the task. I think it is justified and is something that has a particular and circumscribed focus and does not talk about the whole issue of Kashmir. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After our distant and more recent experiences, we should be doing all we can to put a stop to genocide, and where it has already taken place we should commemorate it and give families the right to the graves of their ancestors and compensation for them. The situation in Kashmir demands that the necessary financial and technical assistance be given to the Indian Government and that the UN response be strengthened in order to return the situation in this region of the world to normality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In June there was a mass wave of arrests in Bangladesh, taking advantage of extraordinary powers enabling arrests to be made without a warrant when a link between the person being arrested and criminal offences can be presumed. In fact, the arrests concerned leaders, members and sympathisers of the two main opposition groups, the Awami League and the Bangladesh People’s Party, who were refusing to cooperate with the government in organising general elections until their leaders were released from captivity. Today’s incipient negotiations with the Awami League are cause for hope. The massive rise in food prices is threatening the stability of the country, however. Under these conditions, the elections planned for December are no guarantee that Bangladesh is setting off down the road of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights, which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections. We call for the armed forces to be withdrawn from actions linked to the organisation of the elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that new electronic register. It is a major task which has been undertaken and indeed, if it is fulfilled in time and ensures that minority groups etc. are also included on it, this will really be an historic achievement by the Bangladeshi authorities. We know that the electoral register has also had a very positive effect already, certainly for a number of women from poorer families and backgrounds, who feel that at last they have an identity, that they can now borrow small amounts of money to set up their own businesses etc.</p>
<p class="contents">So there have been some positive moves. We also welcome recent action on war criminals and the action that the government, or at least some of it, has taken against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have major concerns about the role and activity of the continuing interim government and the state of emergency. There are some who have said that the state of emergency is a technical issue, as it were, to ensure that a government can at least continue beyond the caretaker period.</p>
<p class="contents">But whether one agrees with that or not, I think that what is happening with the state of emergency is really beginning to reflect a clear lack of checks and balances within the system there, particularly given the reports, as we have just been hearing, of mass arrests, the lack of due process, the allegations of torture, reports of extrajudicial killings, pressure on journalists and increasing violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a clear need for the interim government to rein in the security forces, to cease the mass arrests and to proceed to either charge or release those people arrested and to ensure due process. Certainly this resolution reflects the wish which I think is there in Parliament to lift the state of emergency and to ensure that civil society can proceed to full, fair, free elections with the support of the European Union, at any rate in its electoral monitoring capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Bangladesh is very problematic. The whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon. Bangladesh is not a democratic state, but of course the world is full of undemocratic states and violations of democracy. Of all the undemocratic states only Zimbabwe has received the condemnation of the EU and the United States. The undemocratic nature of its elections can be freely criticised in the western media because the country has no oil. Oil is a protective buffer against condemnations of violations of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Bangladesh is not an oil state either. For that reason the media could highlight the situation in the country with the silent blessing of the oil-dependent ruling powers. Bangladesh has re-introduced the death penalty and following the declaration of the state of emergency 300 000 people were arrested on flimsy grounds, 12 000 of whom have died in the last month. Several of the people arrested in recent weeks were defenders of democracy, active local members of political parties and supporters of democracy whom the state and the government regard as criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is the word of the day in Bangladesh too, and is the guise for violations of human rights. Bangladesh is not a state based on the rule of law. Human rights violations are carried out there in the form of detentions of the most varied kinds, shortcomings in the defendant’s rights of defence, and defects in both the publication of judgments and in the grounds on which they are based. The human rights enshrined in the constitution are not respected. For those reasons we call on Parliament to support the joint resolution demanding the immediate abrogation of the state of emergency and the holding of free elections in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the elections must be conducted fairly, respect international conventions and give ethnic and religious minorities the opportunity to be involved, both passively and actively. Electoral observers, including from the European Union, should perform the necessary monitoring within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, extremist attacks must be prevented. The new Counterterrorism Ordinance 2008, aimed at achieving this, must comply with international law, however. That is not yet the case. Currently, it is being used mainly to target people who are victims of political persecution. It is no wonder that Bangladesh is a place of fear, when human rights activists and citizens who express criticism are arbitrarily arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Those arrested have a right to due process. The human rights organisation Odhikar has stated that information about mass arrests and maltreatment has been substantiated. As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) delegation of the European Parliament, I have visited Bangladesh several times. Many Members here today were also present. In that moderate Islamic country, there are many in positions of responsibility who are favourably disposed. They are waiting desperately for input from outside, namely from the European Union – the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I congratulate you on the decision you have just taken regarding quorums in the European Parliament. Mrs Gill, I wish we could keep all our urgencies alive and did not constantly have to say that they would be handled by the relevant committee. Mr Matsakis is absolutely right. One step further in this regard would be that suddenly there were no more intergroups. That would also be fatal, because committees cannot do this work.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the most of the opportunity of having enough time, so that we no longer see the situation we now have, where the poor President has to use the gavel – because, in the future, we shall hopefully have twice as long to speak, so that the European Parliament will be known as the voice of human rights and can become stronger – and that takes time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe the focus of our relations with Bangladesh should be to support the democratic movements in the country and the establishment of rule of law, as well as helping to build democratic institutions.

<p class="contents">I would like to address the points Mr Mann raised against me because I think it is not proper to take on points from the previous debate. I would say that, if we take our urgencies really seriously, Mr Mann should make sure that those people are here. The onus is on all of us to make sure that our colleagues are here because we have minority groups influencing how the European Parliament is viewed across the world.

The well-known company Goldman Sachs stated that Bangladesh was a country with a very promising future, as far as swift economic growth was concerned. Today we are looking at a massive regression, and there is a political crisis. The army has appeared in the streets. Moreover, the army would like to change the Constitution in order to introduce, as it puts it, its own form of democracy. We have heard this one before.

One effect of this has been, for example, to increase the number of death sentences, and more than 300 000 people have been arrested, a number of them having been tortured. The problem is that these repressions are showing no signs of weakening. Six weeks ago more than 12 000 people were arrested. All this is taking place against a dramatic economic background. Rice and basic foodstuff prices have risen by a third. There will probably also be a vast wave of emigration, which will reach 25 million in the next 40 years. This exodus will be caused by the floods that are highly likely as a result of rising water levels in the Bay of Bengal. This all points to one conclusion: Bangladesh is a country in which we must take an interest; we must give it support. We must also support economic and democratic change in that country – the poorest country in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world keeps hearing of more and more instances of human rights violations in that country. Since January 2007, Bangladesh has been in a state of emergency. The Anti-Terrorism Ordinance introduced on 11 June has placed additional restrictions on human rights, becoming another tool in the political battle. During the past 18 months 300 000 arrests have been made and the scope of application of the death penalty has been widened. Prisoners are subjected to torture and die in unexplained circumstances. The Bangladeshi authorities are not doing a lot to support the economy in the country, where food prices have risen by more than a third in recent months, and where a quarter of the territory is threatened by a constant risk of flooding and humanitarian disaster. An opportunity for change in the country is provided by free parliamentary elections preceded by a lifting of the state of emergency. It is essential for the caretaker government to guarantee freedom of the media in the pre-election period and the involvement of representatives of all the country’s ethnic and religious minorities in the elections. The EU should restore as soon as possible its election observation mission in Bangladesh, and prior to that the European Commission’s Office in Bangladesh must carefully monitor the political situation in the country and the status of observance of fundamental human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation is taking place in a country that is in the vanguard of the world’s poorest and most densely populated countries. Against this background it has to be stated with concern that the European Union is attributing too little importance to the problems of Bangladesh. This must change. A good opportunity for this should be provided by the parliamentary elections that have been announced for the end of the year. The European Commission and the Council should most definitely play a more active role in getting the state of emergency lifted and putting an end to human rights violations.

One of the things we are looking at today is the situation in Bangladesh, where the elections planned for 22 January 2007 did not take place and have been postponed until December 2008. This fact has exacerbated the situation, leading on the one hand to numerous socio-political protests and on the other to a tightening of legal regulations and a tougher response from government forces. The expressions terrorism, acts detrimental to goods and individuals and serious crimes are often used as grounds for arrests and court rulings. The state of unrest is being made worse by a food crisis, causing a rise in expenditure on food by as much as 60%. The problem is not one that can be resolved by the use of force – arrests, court rulings, incarcerations. What is needed is a reconciliation between the warring factions.

It supports its abolition and the need for an immediate moratorium on executions where the death penalty still applies.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter is the case in many states in the USA such as Georgia, where Troy Davis is awaiting his lawful killing to be carried out at the end of July. Apart from ideological and humanistic considerations against executing human beings, in the case of Troy Davis there appear to be additional reasons in the form of serious doubts as to the robustness and validity of the evidence which led to his conviction in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Such doubts, we believe, justify the reasoning of any individual using common sense that retrial should be granted in this case. Consequently we call on the relevant authorities in the USA to order that Troy Davis be retried and, if found guilty again, that his death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we call once again on the US Government, and all governments in the world that still have capital punishment, to abolish the death penalty in the interests of humanity. In particular we call on the governments of those countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia where executions are still carried out regularly, and where in many instances this is done in a most appallingly barbaric way, to stop executions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since we cannot conceal the fact that opinions differ on this matter, it seems to me that we should be talking about the very specific case of an individual who was given the death penalty, subsequent to which seven out of nine witnesses to the charge against him withdrew their testimony. This is a very specific situation. I would not want us to veer off in an abstract fashion into a debate on whether the death penalty is completely bad or not. I do not want at the present moment to call on the US authorities to amend a law that in 1972, that is 36 years ago, brought back the death penalty. We are talking about a specific and extraordinarily controversial case. It really is worth defending Mr Davis and demonstrating that there are situations in which it is worthwhile intervening. I would caution against generalisations, and that is why I did not sign this joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I would urge each and every one of us in this Chamber and listening to this debate to make personal representations to the American Government – and indeed the Georgia state government – to see if clemency can be applied. Then we would move towards a retrial, if that is necessary. At least we would have a living being and a retrial would be able to take place. I think it is really important that we take our personal responsibility on this as well as looking to representations by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, in this particular case, the evidence – as we have also been hearing from many of the witnesses – has been retracted and contradicted. The American Bar Association’s Georgia Death Penalty Assessment Team released a report looking at the circumstances in that particular state and felt that one of the major problems they had found was inadequate defence counsel, and a concern that defendants already on death row may not have had adequate counsel at the time of their trials. They noted that Georgia was the only state that did not provide lawyers to death row inmates for their post-conviction appeals.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are a number of reasons to be very concerned about this particular case, which is the one cited in the title of the resolution on the death penalty, notably the case of Troy Davis. But I would also like to raise other cases, in particular what is happening at the moment with some of those still detained in Guantánamo. One case in particular concerns a British resident, Binyamin Mohamed, who has been detained there for over six years now and is likely to face a military commission where the death penalty is all too possibly an outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, and the European Union as a whole, takes a very strong view on the death penalty. We consider that it is not something that a civilised society should be applying, and that there are all too many reasons for death penalties not to be imposed. The case of Troy Davis is, I think, an absolutely classic example of the real problems with the implementation of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, as well as what is called for in this particular resolution, I would call on each and every one of us, as responsible individuals, also to take action in communicating our distress on this particular case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we, the European Parliament, are supporting a person we have never met, Troy Davis, who is to be executed at the end of this month. Can you imagine yourself in his place, having had to spend 17 years waiting to be either cleared or executed, when there is strong evidence that he is innocent, with the seven witnesses who gave evidence against him having retracted their statements, and so on. We are aware of quite a few cases of a person being executed and his innocence being proved only afterwards. There are a lot of known cases where people are given the death penalty but avoid execution owing to the discovery of new evidence that proves they are not guilty of the crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, today we are once again calling on all the countries of the world in which the death penalty is still used to take immediate measures to abolish it. Today we are making our position against the death penalty clear, standing by a real person and pleading with the relevant US courts to reinvestigate the case of Troy Davis and pass a more lenient sentence instead of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, supporting a real person, trying to protect him from being executed, even if he has made a huge mistake, is the best way to make our position on the necessity of abolishing the death penalty absolutely clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The death penalty is the most disrespectful of all the instances of contempt for dignity, civilisation and progress. Right now, at this precise moment, when we are breathing and speaking freely, one man, Troy Davis, is locked up in a cell, counting the minutes left of his life. He has been on death row for more than 15 years and has always denied committing the crime he was accused of. Some of those who testified against him have recanted or contradicted themselves in their statements, which were obtained under police coercion. There is no clear, objective and convincing evidence in this case. The application of the death penalty to Troy Davis by the authorities of the State of Georgia runs completely counter to the moratorium on the death penalty adopted last December by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the moratorium is not legally binding, it carries enormous moral and political significance. It is now up to the States who do not abide by it to review their policy with a view to abolishing the death penalty and respecting human rights in their entirety. The State of Georgia now has the opportunity with this case to give the most fundamental values of democracy the substance they deserve once again. Commissioner Louis Michel recently heard the President of Sudan himself, Omar al-Bashir, say that he would not hand over those who have been indicted for crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court, just as the United States does not. The United States’ example in these two areas is a disgrace, and we have to bring all means available to bear on the United States to show that we cannot accept this stance and the terrible example that is being set for the world in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as the resolution requests, it is vital that the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission Delegation in Washington make representations so as to prevent Troy Davis’ sentence being carried out and for the United States to effectively review its position on the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The true number was undoubtedly higher. Of those executions, 88% were carried out in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two matters I would like to raise in today’s debate. Firstly, I disagree entirely with what was said by my fellow Member Mr Czarnecki, that this issue is the subject of differences within the European Union. That is not the case. I would like to remind Mr Czarnecki of the official stance taken in the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrine, which was also the personal view of Pope John Paul II, who was against the use of the death penalty. It seems to me that that should be a very clear indication to Mr Czarnecki of the stance of the majority on this matter in EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter is of course the ongoing situation linked to the situation of Troy Davis in the United States, on whom the death penalty is to be carried out. We must do all we can to suspend the execution of this death sentence and to enable a review process to take place, with a possible replacement by a life sentence if he is proven guilty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any other situation there is always the potential to drop the verdict and return someone to normal life. In the case of the death sentence this potential does not exist.

This request was based on a written request from forty Members. In fact, to be entirely honest, 39 + 1, because the eleventh name on the list is completely illegible. I cannot tell you, we cannot tell you, who the fortieth signatory is on that list.</p>
<p class="contents">After a debate and having received the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I took responsibility and I also interpreted Rule 149(4) of our Rules of Procedure, which states that the Members who made a request for the quorum to be established shall be counted as present even if they are no longer in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the words ‘no longer’. It does not say ‘are not in the Chamber’, but ‘are no longer’. This implies that they must have been there previously. The ‘previously’ certainly does not refer to the fact that they were present in previous months, but most definitely to when the quorum request was made. I therefore specified that before the votes I would check whether the forty signatories were present, even if I was having trouble telling you who the fortieth one was.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the services, five of them are present. Having said this, if forty Members now stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established, I will do so. Are there forty Members who will stand up and make a request for the quorum to be established? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is examining various possibilities for ensuring that all the commitments in the conclusions on Somalia that it adopted on 26 May and 16 June are fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Council encourages an all-inclusive dialogue involving all the parties present in Somalia, through a political dialogue with members of the Transitional Federal Institutions, moderate members of the opposition and civil society. With this in mind, the Council fully supports the agreement made in Djibouti on 9 June between the Transitional Federal Government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia and will continue to provide political and financial support for the efforts made by the UN.</p>
<p>The Council is deeply troubled by the extremely serious humanitarian situation in Somalia. It has welcomed the intention expressed by the Transitional Federal Government to create a focal point for the humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The Council supports the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including the Independent Expert for Somalia, and has encouraged them to undertake an independent fact-finding and assessment mission to address the human rights situation.</p>
<p>In response to the request in the Council conclusions on Somalia of 16 June, the Secretariat General of the Council and the Commission are examining the possibilities for implementing Resolution 1816 regarding combating piracy and armed robbery in the waters off the coast of Somalia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0449"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures to be promoted over the next six months with a view to reducing the number of road accident victims in the EU, the French Presidency of the Council will ensure the adoption of the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on road infrastructure safety management<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on which the Council and the European Parliament have just reached an agreement at first reading.</p>
<p>The aim of this proposal is to ensure that safety is integrated in all phases of planning, design and operation of road infrastructure in the Trans-European Network. Along with economic and environmental considerations, safety will be paramount in the design of new infrastructures. The proposed directive will also provide managers of road infrastructure with access to the guidelines, training and information required to ensure safety in the road network.</p>
<p>The French Presidency also attaches particular importance to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This legislative proposal has already undergone an initial examination phase under the Slovenian Presidency, and this work will continue under the French Presidency, which has made it one of its priorities for transport. The aim of this text is to enable the enforcement of sanctions against drivers who commit an offence in another Member State than the one where their vehicle is registered. Its aim is to improve safety on European roads whilst putting an end to discrimination against resident drivers.</p>
<p>This proposal for a directive will complement the legislation established by the Council Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This Framework Decision, adopted in February 2005, will help ensure that individuals and companies no longer avoid paying fines. It will enable a judicial or administrative authority to transmit a financial penalty direct to an authority in another Member State and have that penalty recognised and executed without further formalities.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that on 11 and 12 September in Paris, the French Presidency is organising a seminar on coordinating the improvement of road safety, focused on the issue of monitoring and penalties. It will also host a conference in Paris on 13 October on ‘Road Safety in our Cities’ organised by the Commission as part of European Road Safety Day.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Regarding the steps to be taken in order to provide a long-term political response to the global food crisis, the Council refers the Honourable Member to the answer to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0358_EN.html">H-0358/08</a> asked by Dimitrios Papadimoulis.</p>
<p>In addition, as the Honourable Member is surely aware, at its last meeting on 20 June, the European Council examined the political consequences of the rise in food and oil prices. I refer her to the Presidency conclusions on this point.</p>
<p>In the agricultural sector, the Union has already acted to moderate the pressure on food prices by selling intervention stocks, reducing export refunds, removing the set-aside requirement for 2008, increasing milk quotas and suspending import duties on cereals, thus improving supply and helping to stabilise agricultural markets.</p>
<p>The Council also underlines that in the EU and globally there is a need to pursue work on innovation, research and development relating to agricultural production. These activities will be particularly important because of climate change, which will require the agricultural sector to make considerable efforts to adapt. This issue was examined informally on 19 May 2008 by the Agriculture Ministers, with the participation of Commissioners Janez Potočnik and Mariann Fischer Boel, in particular with the aim of defining future research and development priorities.</p>
<p>Finally, the Honourable Member is surely aware that on 3 July, in partnership with the Commission and the European Parliament, the French Presidency organised a conference on the theme ‘Who will feed the world?’. The aim of this conference was to discuss the challenges that agriculture must take up today, including the future of agriculture in developing countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0453"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member raised the important issue of family policy, and she is right to point out that we need to support the most vulnerable families. The Council is also resolved to take strong measures in this field.</p>
<p>In the conclusions that it adopted in May 2007, the Council gave its support to the creation of the European Alliance for the Family and called on the Member States ‘to make intensive use of the opportunities for exchanges of opinion and experience offered by the Alliance for Families’.<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>As the Honourable Member is well aware, the Council regularly re-examines the issues relating to employment policy in the context of the Lisbon strategy. In February this year, the EPSCO Council adopted a set of key messages that it forwarded to the Spring European Council<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in which it called for more and better jobs and pointed out that it was important to have inclusive labour markets and for the gender equality dimension to be taken into account. These key messages were adopted by the European Council in March 2008.</p>
<p>With regard to the balance between family and working life, it should be recalled that in 2000 the Council adopted a resolution on the balanced participation of women and men in family and working life<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This issue remains among the Council’s priorities, and it recently adopted conclusions entitled ‘Balanced roles of women and men for jobs, growth and social cohesion’, in which it called on the Member States ‘to promote effective policies to reconcile work, family and private life that do not compel women and men to choose between family and work or to prioritise one to the detriment of the other’.<a href="#defann_5_4" name="refann_5_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>With regard to the Council’s future work in this field, I am pleased to announce that the French Presidency will present its programme to the European Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on 15 July 2008. The French Presidency also presented its programme to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 25 June 2008.</p>
<p>Finally, I am happy to note that the Council and the European Parliament have agreed to make the issue of families, in particular large families and single parents, one of the priorities of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010), which will soon be announced by a decision that both institutions will adopt together. I would like to thank the Honourable Member, who was the rapporteur for this matter, for her constructive cooperation during the negotiations.</p>
<p>With regard to VAT rates, the Honourable Member is aware that the Council acts on the basis of proposals from the Commission; so far it has not presented any proposals of the type suggested by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>A discussion on VAT rates should take place soon, but it would be premature for the Council to prejudge the results of the forthcoming discussions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council would like to point out that it is for the Commission to present a proposal on the possibilities for cod fishing in the Baltic in 2009, in the light of the recommendations made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and on the basis of the scientific opinions issued by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU has expressed its serious concern on several occasions regarding the continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The Quartet, meeting at the highest level, in its statement of 2 May and then in its statement of 24 June, called for continued emergency and humanitarian assistance and the provision of essential services to Gaza without obstruction. It also strongly encouraged Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and Egypt to work together to formulate a new approach on Gaza that would provide security to all Gazans, end all acts of terror and provide for the controlled and sustained opening of the Gaza crossings for humanitarian reasons and commercial flows. The Egypt-brokered truce that entered into force on 19 June is a positive step in that direction. The EU Presidency welcomed this truce in its statement of 18 June 2008. It is important for it to be respected by all the parties.</p>
<p>With regard to ‘the formation of a unity government involving Hamas as an acceptable step towards a solution’, in its conclusions of 23 and 24 April 2007, the Council said that it was ready to work with a Palestinian Government whose policies and actions reflected the Quartet principles. In 2007, the EU initiated cooperation with members of the National Unity Government who had accepted these principles. The EU has noted the inter-Palestinian reconciliation initiative begun last month by President Mahmoud Abbas. We support any step that could strengthen the peace efforts of the Palestinian President. The aim is still the creation of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza that will unite all Palestinians, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0467"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s report on China’s policy and its effects on Africa. Among the issues the report tackles, it sets out the challenges that the EU will have to take up as a player on the world stage. At the last summit, held in June, some of the issues of global interest mentioned by the Honourable Member were debated, and are mentioned in the Presidency’s conclusions.</p>
<p>In recent years, both the EU and China have reviewed and strengthened their political, economic and development partnership with Africa. The EU thus adopted a Joint EU-Africa Strategy at the Lisbon Summit in 2007. China and Africa signed a joint declaration at the China-Africa Cooperation Forum, at the Summit held in Beijing in 2006.</p>
<p>Since 2005, Africa has been on the agendas of the meetings that the EU has held with China as part of the bilateral dialogue. The Council has also, through an initial official meeting of the Troika held in Beijing last year, begun a regular dialogue with top-level Chinese officials, which is solely focused on issues of mutual interest in Africa.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission has further stepped up its activities and has stated that it is going to adopt a communication on China and Africa in October this year with the aim of possible trilateral cooperation between Africa, China and the EU. Subject to further consultations and an agreement with China and Africa, it will also be proposed that cooperation be established in important fields such as sustainable development of natural resources, infrastructures, peace and security. China has said that it is not opposed to this type of trilateral cooperation, provided that Africa agrees to this approach.</p>
<p>With regard to the other new players, such as Brazil and India, the Council considers that the major global problems can only be dealt with in a multilateral framework based on a strong UN. We need to ensure that the third countries that have an interest in Africa also support the principle of effective multilateralism, which is the best way of preserving peace and security at international level and meeting the challenges, safeguarding against the risks and taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the interdependent world that we know today. Some initial steps have been taken towards India, where the general development of the situation in Africa is already among the concerns. Discussions are under way with Brazil with the aim of adopting an action plan, one of the chapters of which should be devoted to Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0471"></a>

<p>In Algeria on 3 June 2008, suspended prison sentences were handed down to four people who had converted to Christianity for 'the illegal practice of a non-Islamic religion'. More particularly, they were punished in this way because they had not practised their religion within the framework laid down by the Law of 28 February 2006. This law provides, in particular, that the place where a religion is practised must be approved by the Minister for Religious Affairs. The sentenced persons had installed a prayer area in their flat ('Quatre chrétiens condamnés en Algérie', Le Figaro.fr, 3 June 2008; Ryma Achoura, 'De la prison avec sursis pour des chrétiens d'Algérie', Libération.fr, 4 June 2008).</p>

<p>A Member State has submitted to the SIS Working Party a proposal (Working Document 8204/08) that a list be drawn up under the Schengen Information System of ‘violent offenders’ who take part in international demonstrations.

<p>As stated in the Council’s working methods for implementing Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism, any new facts relating to previous listings are duly taken into account when assessing whether the grounds for those listings are still valid.</p>

Following the judgment of the Court of First Instance, during the first six months of 2007 the Council conducted a detailed examination and consolidated its procedures for including persons, groups and entities on the aforementioned list and removing them from it under Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>In its reply to question E 1666/08, the Commission pointed out that it 'shares … concern with regard to incitement to hatred broadcast under the jurisdiction of one of the Member States.' Hamas’ TV station Al-Aqsa uses European satellite capacity of the French company Eutelsat’s Atlantic Bird 4, which Eutelsat leases to the Jordanian satellite provider Noorsat, to incite violence and hatred and justify terrorism in Europe and beyond. As on Hezbollah’s TV station Al-Manar, on Al-Aqsa programming children dress up as suicide bombers and are presented as heroes. In one segment, Assud, a popular bunny character, advocates martyrdom and suicide bombings as the ideal goal for every child who phones into the show. In another segment the cartoon character says that he will 'bite and eat up' the Danes because a Danish newspaper published political cartoons they did not like. Assud the bunny accepts a phone call on the show from someone who says that 'we will manage to kill, to assassinate' the cartoonist, to which Assud wholeheartedly agrees.</p>
<p>What is the Council planning to prevent Al-Aqsa broadcasting on European satellite capacity? Given the similarities between Al-Manar and the incitement to violence and terrorism broadcast on Al Aqsa, does this not amount to a violation of Article 3b ('Incitement to hatred') of the revised Audiovisual Without Frontiers Directive (Directive 2007/65/EC<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>), as was the case with 'Al-Manar'?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The broadcasting of television programmes containing incitement to racial or religious hatred is incompatible with the values that are the basis of our democracies, and is totally intolerable.</p>
<p>Article 2(4) and (6) of the Directive on audiovisual media services (Directive 89/552/EEC last amended by Directive 2007/65/EC) states that service providers established in third countries may, in certain cases, fall under the jurisdiction of a Member State.</p>

<p>In addition, the European Union rejects all public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, as demonstrated by the amendment recently made to the Council Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2002/475/JHA), which includes three new offences: public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. It is also envisaged that all the Member States will ratify the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Terrorism (2006), which obliges the parties to criminalise pubic provocation to commit a terrorist offence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The significant issues raised in this question have been discussed within the Council on several occasions, in particular on the basis of the Communications from the Commission ‘Tackling the challenge of rising food prices’<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and ‘Facing the challenge of higher oil prices’<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The European Council of 19 and 20 June 2008 discussed this subject on the basis of a report by the Ecofin Council on ‘Recent developments in food prices – main drivers and policy responses’<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Presidency Conclusions therefore establish a series of specific measures to be carried out, the majority of which must be implemented before December 2008.</p>
<p>In its conclusions the Presidency also notes the specific measures already taken by the European Union, in particular in the agriculture sector, in order to moderate the pressure on food prices by selling intervention stocks, reducing export refunds, removing the set-aside requirement for 2008, increasing milk quotas and suspending import duties on cereals, thus improving supply and helping to stabilise agricultural markets. In addition, the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy have contributed to increased efficiency in the agricultural sector in Europe. The Council will examine other measures for tackling these issues in the context of the CAP health check.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures to be taken, the European Council has highlighted the importance of ensuring the sustainability of bio-fuel policies, by setting sustainability criteria for the production of first-generation bio-fuels and by encouraging the development of the second-generation bio-fuels made from by-products, as well as the need to assess without delay possible impacts on agricultural products for food and to take action, if necessary, to deal with any problems.</p>
<p>The European Council has also declared its determination to continue to strive for a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Round and to discourage third countries from imposing food export restrictions and export bans. The European Union will raise this issue in the WTO and other relevant international fora.</p>
<p>The European Council has welcomed the Commission’s initiative to examine the issue of restrictive regulations in the retail sector and the Commission’s intention to closely monitor activities in commodity-related financial markets, including speculative trade, and their impact on price movements as well as any policy implications. It has invited the Commission to report back on this issue in advance of the December 2008 European Council and to consider proposing adequate policy responses, including measures aimed at improving market transparency.</p>
<p>With regard to oil and gas prices, the Presidency has been invited, in cooperation with the Commission, to examine the feasibility and impact of measures to smooth the effects of sudden oil and gas price increases and report before the October 2008 European Council. The European Council has also invited Member States, the Commission and the European Investment Bank to support measures aimed at facilitating investments by households and industry in energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources as well as a more environmentally-friendly use of fossil fuels. It has called on the Member States and the Commission to expedite the implementation of the 2006 Action Plan on energy efficiency and consider its possible revision.</p>
<p>These same conclusions encouraged the Commission to monitor, in addition to food and oil prices, developments in other commodity-related markets, and invited the General Affairs and External Relations Council to follow closely the work conducted in the other relevant Council configurations on the issues linked to food and oil prices and to report to the European Council by October 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council has taken note of information reporting possible links between political figures and members of Colombian paramilitary groups, and will closely monitor the development of the situation. The Association Agreement that is under negotiation with the Andean Community will obviously include the standard clause on human rights and democratic principles. In this case, it is appropriate to point out that in its conclusions on Colombia adopted at the end of 2007:</p>
<p>‘The Council […] expresses the EU’s total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, and underlines the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law (JPL) and its related legal framework and the development of the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) process under the JPL.</p>
<p>The Council reconfirms the readiness of the EU and its Member States to assist the Colombian Government, state institutions, civil society and international organisations in providing support for activities that promote peace, truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation and in providing support for activities that advance DDR processes.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the steps that have been taken by the Colombian Government and Colombian authorities to implement the JPL in a transparent and effective manner, the work of the National Reconciliation and Reparation Commission and the role played by the Constitutional Court. It also welcomes the appointment and the work of the High Commissioner for the Social and Economic Integration of Armed Individuals and Groups.</p>
<p>While recognising what has been achieved, the Council also takes note that the implementation of the JPL is far from complete. It urges the Colombian government to support and resource the quick and efficient implementation of all aspects of the JPL – including by providing adequate staffing to the Justice and Peace Law unit within the Office of the Attorney General – in a manner that gives priority to victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparation.’</p>
<p>The Council also encouraged ‘the Colombian Government’s determination to improve the armed forces’ respect for human rights and welcomes the progress which has been made in this respect. However, it note[d] with real concern the persisting problem of human rights violations by some members of the security forces, including extra-judicial killings.’</p>
<p>Finally, the Council said it was ‘concerned by the emergence of new paramilitary and other armed criminal groups. It takes note of the efforts already taken by the authorities to fight these emerging groups and calls on the Colombian Government to increase its ongoing efforts and step up the measures it is taking to fight these groups.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0490"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 28 February 2008, Cuba signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which the EU Presidency welcomed in its statement of 4 March 2008.</p>
<p>Until these covenants have been ratified, Cuban citizens cannot invoke their provisions. However, the Council points out that, by signing them, Cuba has already declared its intention to respect the civil and political rights listed in these covenants, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights agreements that Cuba has ratified.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 23 June 2008 on Cuba, the Council called upon the Cuban authorities to ratify and implement these covenants and once again called on the Cuban Government to make real the commitment to human rights that it has demonstrated through the signing of these two human rights covenants.</p>
<p>In the same conclusions, the Council noted the changes undertaken so far by the Cuban Government. It said that it supported liberalising changes in Cuba and encouraged the Government to introduce them.</p>
<p>The Council called upon the Cuban Government to improve effectively the human rights situation by, inter alia, releasing unconditionally all political prisoners, including those who were detained and sentenced in 2003. This remains a key priority for the EU. The Council also called upon the Cuban Government to facilitate access for international humanitarian organisations to Cuban prisons.</p>
<p>The Council indicated that it remained committed to the common position of 1996, which was still entirely relevant, and reaffirmed its determination to pursue a dialogue with the Cuban authorities as well as with representatives of civil society and the democratic opposition, in accordance with EU policies, in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards a pluralist democracy. The Council underlined that the EU would continue to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba. The EU also reiterated its call on the Cuban Government to grant freedom of information and expression, including access to the Internet, and invited the Cuban Government to cooperate on this matter.</p>
<p>The EU reiterated the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future and said that it remained ready to contribute positively to the future development of all sectors of Cuban society including through development cooperation instruments.</p>
<p>The Council added that the EU was ready to resume a comprehensive and open dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all topics of mutual interest. Since June 2007, preliminary discussions on the possibility to launch such a dialogue have taken place at Ministerial level between the EU and Cuba and bilaterally. This dialogue should include the whole range of potential fields of cooperation including the human rights sphere as well as the political, economic, scientific and cultural spheres, and should take place on a reciprocal, unconditional, non-discriminatory and result-oriented basis. Within the framework of this dialogue, the EU will outline to the Cuban Government its views on democracy, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Council reaffirmed that its policy for EU contacts with the democratic opposition remains valid. During high level visits, human rights issues should always be addressed; when appropriate, meetings with the democratic opposition will be part of high level visits.</p>
<p>The Council therefore agreed to pursue the above mentioned comprehensive political dialogue with the Cuban Government. In this context, the Council agreed to the lifting of the already suspended 2003 measures as a means to facilitate the political dialogue process and enable the full use of the instruments of the 1996 Common Position.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the annual review of the Common Position, the Council will proceed in June 2009 to an evaluation of its relations with Cuba, including the effectiveness of the political dialogue process. Following that date, the dialogue will continue if the Council decides that it has been effective, taking into account in particular the elements contained in paragraph 2 of the conclusions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0493"></a>

<p>In November 2007, the US-backed military regime of the dictator Musharraf of Pakistan imposed martial law, made numerous arrests and inflicted brutal violence on the Pakistani people. The dictatorship also had its sights trained on the country's legal profession who had opposed it, imprisoning thousands of lawyers, whilst dismissing 45 senior members of the judiciary from their posts, including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Iftikhar Chaudhry, and subjecting them to political persecution. The dismissed judges had also protested against the abduction and imprisonment of their compatriots in various Guantanamo-type punishment camps and the selling off of the country's wealth. Four months after the defeat of Musharraf and the election of a new government, the dismissed judges have yet to be reinstated, while US pressure intensifies on Pakistan to remain a loyal ally of the USA in its hysterical 'war on terror'.</p>

These negotiations will not therefore be affected by the outcome of the referendum in Ireland and may continue as planned.

These negotiations were launched at the recent EU-Russia Summit in Khanty-Mansiysk, where a joint statement indicating the following was adopted:</p>
<p>‘We agreed that the aim is to conclude a strategic agreement that will provide a comprehensive framework for EU/Russia relations for the foreseeable future and help to develop the potential of our relationship. It should provide for a strengthened legal basis and legally binding commitments covering all main areas of the relationship, as included in the four EU/Russia common spaces and their road maps which were agreed at the Moscow Summit in May 2005.</p>
<p>The New Agreement will build on the international commitments which bind the EU and Russia.’</p>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is fully aware of the need to seek relevant, effective responses to rising food prices.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the subject was examined by the European Council on 19-20 June<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on the basis of the Council’s work and the Communication presented by the Commission<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The price surge is a complex phenomenon, with many root causes and consequences.</p>
<p>The reasons cited include, in particular, the climate issue and the recent poor harvests in some countries of the world, largely due to unfavourable climate conditions; the increase in global demand for certain foods, in particular from some emerging countries; the development of biofuels worldwide; the effect of speculation on the financial markets on price volatility and rises, and the increased food production and transport costs due to the rise in oil prices.</p>
<p>Given this complex situation, the European Council stresses the importance of adequate monitoring by all the relevant bodies, and mentions a range of possible avenues. In this context, among other aspects it identifies agriculture as being able to make a useful contribution and being one of the elements of possible responses to the current crisis.</p>
<p>In this respect the European Council states in its conclusions that ‘the Union has already acted to moderate the pressure on food prices through the sale of intervention stocks, the reduction in export refunds, the removal of the set-aside requirement for 2008, the increase in milk quotas, and the suspension of import duties for cereals, thus improving supply and helping to stabilise agricultural markets’.</p>
<p>The European Council also states, in substance, that the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy (CAP) ‘have enhanced its market orientation […] and made EU farmers more responsive to price developments’; according to the European Council it is therefore important to continue and improve this orientation, ‘while ensuring fair competition and fostering sustainable agriculture across the EU and ensuring an adequate food supply’.</p>
<p>For the future, the European Council points out that, ‘In the context of the CAP Health Check, the Council will consider further steps to address these issues’.</p>
<p>Specific measures to assist the poorest people, both in Europe and in the world, are also being prepared in the Commission services, and the Council will examine them when the time comes. We must also continue our efforts to give a higher priority to the agricultural sector in our cooperation policy.</p>
<p>Finally, forecasts of an increased harvest for the next agricultural year should help to reduce pressure on agricultural prices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>With regard to the directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals: the Council would like to point out that the proposal in question is based on Article 63(3)(b) of the EC Treaty. Consequently, the codecision procedure applies and the Council will decide by qualified majority.</p>
<p>At the plenary sitting on 18 June 2008, Parliament adopted amendments to the Commission’s proposal. As these amendments correspond to those that the Chairman of Coreper had indicated to the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by letter on 4 June 2008 as being acceptable to the Council, it can be recorded that an agreement has been reached at first reading<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. A vote has not therefore yet taken place in the Council, but rather talks during which an informal agreement was reached on the content of that letter.</p>
<p>Currently, a legal and language revision of the text resulting from Parliament’s vote is being conducted by experts from the two institutions. Afterwards, the European Parliament and the Council, deciding by qualified majority, will adopt the legislative text.</p>
<p>With regard to the directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time: on 9 June 2008, the Council reached an agreement by qualified majority on an overall compromise proposed by the Presidency regarding this directive. Four delegations (Greek, Hungarian, Maltese and Spanish) were not able to accept the Presidency compromise proposal, and three other delegations (Belgian, Cypriot and Portuguese) abstained. Five delegations (Belgian, Cypriot, Greek, Hungarian and Spanish) made a joint statement to be entered in the Council Minutes<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, explaining their position.

<p>In 2005, the high-level expert group chaired by Loyola de Palacio drew up a report on extending the TEN-T networks with a view to integration in the field of transport between the Union and its neighbours. In early 2008, the Commission published a communication on the matter. That year saw the start of the Union's practice of analysing the state of play regarding the priority TEN-T projects, with the consequent proposals for extending the list of 30 priority projects approved in 2004. 6 May 2008 witnessed an informal meeting in Ljubljana of the EU's transport ministers, whose agenda included extending the TEN-T networks to take account of the requirements of the 27.</p>
<p>Can the Council provide information on the state of the talks and the timetable for extending the TEN-T networks, as well as specifying which of the Union's transport projects (maritime, high-speed rail, rail freight, air or road) will impact positively on the EU's Black Sea outlets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its Members, was not given orally during Council Question Time at the July 2008 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is well aware that the Council cannot examine amendments to be made to legal instruments in force on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. The Commission has not yet presented a proposal to amend Decision No 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, which contains a list of 30 priority projects. According to the Commission, a proposal to revise these guidelines and the list of priority projects is planned for 2010, in accordance with Article 19(3) of the above decision.</p>
<p>It should be noted that priority project No 7, which is in progress (Motorway axis Igoumenitsa/Patra-Athina-Sofia-Budapest, including a branch towards Bucuresti and Constanţa) and priority project No 18 (Rhine/Meuse-Main-Danube inland waterway axis), part of which corresponds to the definition of pan-European corridor VII, contribute to the connection with the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to the need to take into account the changes that have taken place in the EU since the adoption of the guidelines for the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and to respond to the needs of the growing trade and transport flows, as stated in the conclusions on the extension of the major trans-European transport axes to the neighbouring countries, adopted by the ‘Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council’ in June 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0450"></a>

<p>The main aims of Council Directive 1999/70/EC<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, UNICE and CEEP are to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination and to establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.</p>
<p>In order to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts, Clause 5 of the framework agreement obliges the Member States to introduce one or more of the following measures:</p>
<p>(a)	objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts or relationships;</p>
<p>(b)	the maximum total duration of successive, fixed-term employment contracts or relationships;</p>
<p>(c)	the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships.</p>
<p>All Member States have introduced one or more such measures. The result is that fixed-term contracts cannot be renewed more than a certain number of times, or after a certain period of time, or unless there are objective reasons for so doing. The consequences of such transposing legislation should be that fixed-term contracts cannot be renewed or extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>With the exception of Spain, where the legislation was changed to bring teachers of religion within the scope of the Directive, the Commission is not aware of systematic use of repeated fixed-term contracts for staff in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Community law is designed to prevent abuse of repeated fixed-term contracts.

<p>The Commission is aware of the challenges facing the Member States in tackling rising prices and unemployment.</p>
<p>As the March 2008 European Council confirmed, the fundamentals of the European Union's economy remain sound: public deficits have more than halved since 2005 and public debt has also declined to just under 60%; economic growth reached 2.9% in 2007, but is likely to be lower in 2008; 6.5 million jobs were created in the last two years. Although cyclical factors have played a role, these developments have been aided by the structural reforms undertaken over the last few years under the Lisbon Strategy and the beneficial effects of the euro and the single market. As a result, unemployment and long-term unemployment rates are on the decline and employment of female and old-age workers is progressing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, further efforts are still needed in the area of inclusive labour markets. The inclusion of people at the margins of the labour market (the low-skilled, the disabled, migrants and disadvantaged youth) needs to be stepped up in order to meet the employment targets set for 2010 and foster the social dimension of the renewed "Growth and Jobs Strategy".</p>
<p>The inclusion of vulnerable groups is one of the priorities of the Open Method of Coordination on social protection and social inclusion. Through this process, the European Union coordinates and encourages the Member States' action to combat poverty and social exclusion and to reform their social protection systems on the basis of exchanges of good practice and mutual learning. To promote the integration of those most disadvantaged, the Commission is promoting a new 'active inclusion' strategy which combines the provision of an adequate level of income support, stronger links to the labour market, and better access to services. As regards the effects of rising food prices and oil prices in particular, the Honourable Member is referred to the Commission's recent Communications on these issues, including the Communication on "Tackling the challenge of rising food prices: directions for EU action"<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU's food distribution programme for the most deprived persons in the Community<a href="#defann_33_2" name="refann_33_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, under which food aid has been made available to the most deprived for more than 20 years, is now being reviewed with a number of potential innovations. The programme seeks to supplement Member State initiatives and the budget has increased from under €100 million in 1987 to over €305 million in 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would point out that freedom of association should be regarded as a fundamental right. It is therefore to be respected in any situation falling within the scope of application of Community law.</p>
<p>In the Bosman ruling, the Court of Justice stated that ‘freedom of association, [...] enshrined in Article 11 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and resulting from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, is one of the fundamental rights […] which are protected in the Community legal order.’</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that everyone has the right to freedom of association, in particular in trade union matters. The Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers contains a similar provision (Section 13)<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, there is no EC legislation expressly providing for a right of association. Pursuant to Article 137 paragraph 5 of the EC Treaty, the right to adopt measures in the field of social policy does not apply to the right of association.</p>
<p>The Commission would emphasise that the EC Treaty does not empower the Commission to take action against private undertakings which may have infringed the right to freedom of association. In such cases, it is for the national authorities, and in particular the courts, to ensure that that right is respected within their territory on the basis of all the pertinent facts of the specific case and in accordance with national, Community and international law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Earlier than planned, i.e. on the very first day of its EU Presidency, France lifted the restrictions on freedom of movement for workers from the new EU Member States (except Romania and Bulgaria).</p>
<p>In 2006 nationals of the eastern European Member States were granted free access to employment in France, although that right was restricted to certain professional groups, so that only 40% of the French labour market was in fact accessible to the individuals in question. Even before the expiry of the transitional period in 2009, France has now decided to remove all obstacles to the free movement of workers. The fears that the partial opening-up of the labour market would lead to a massive influx of workers from eastern Europe proved unfounded and the embodiment of those fears, the 'Polish plumber', did not destroy the French labour market.</p>
<p>Restrictions on workers from the eastern European Member States still apply in Germany, Austria, Denmark and Belgium, however.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, how will this example set by France as one of the largest EU Member States influence the countries in which the restrictions still apply? What impact will the removal of obstacles to freedom of movement have on the French economy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The transitional arrangements in the 2003 Treaty of Accession allowing Member States to restrict access to their labour markets are divided into three distinct phases. The current (second) phase will end on 30 April 2009. During this phase, the Member States that still restrict access to their labour markets by workers from eight of the 10 Member States that joined on 1 May 2004 may each decide whether to restrict access until the end of the phase or to lift the restrictions earlier.</p>
<p>In principle all restrictions should end on 30 April 2009; only Member States that experience a serious disturbance of their labour markets, or a threat thereof, may continue — subject to notification to the Commission by 30 April 2009 — to restrict access to their labour markets for a maximum of two more years.</p>
<p>The impact on the French economy of France's decision to open its labour market is likely to be positive as French firms will be able to tap into a bigger labour pool, which will allow them more easily to fill vacancies which cannot be filled with local workers. Experience in all Member States that have opened their labour markets earlier than required indicates that labour migration from the 'new' Member States has eased bottlenecks on the labour market, increased the flexibility of the labour force, reduced inflationary pressures, and contributed to economic growth, without having any significant negative impact on unemployment or wages of local workers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0513"></a>

<p>The general anti-immigrant policy and the 'immunity' given to companies are creating situations in which workers are subjected to barbaric treatment. A typical example is the clothing manufacturer, 'Lady Fashion', where the employers use terror and brutal violence on workers who protest at unacceptable working conditions. At the same time, they use every means to prevent the intervention of the trade union. Several workers have been attacked by employers' thugs with piping and clubs because they did not turn up for work on Sunday. In response to the workers' protests at the beatings, the company stated that it was firing them all. Similar violence also occurred in the past when an immigrant worker demanded his outstanding pay.</p>

<p>The Commission considers the exploitation of workers and the violation of their fundamental human rights as unacceptable. All persons, regardless of nationality, have a right to respect for their dignity and their integrity, both physical and mental. These rights are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union solemnly proclaimed in Nice in 2000. Moreover, pursuant to Directive 89/391/EEC<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the employer has a general duty to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work.</p>
<p>As concerns immigrants who are illegally resident in the EU, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive in May 2007 providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Under the proposal, employers would be liable to sanctions, including fines and repayment of outstanding wages. In addition, employers would be liable to criminal penalties in the most serious cases, including where particularly exploitative working conditions are found. Member States would be required to set up effective complaint mechanisms by which relevant third-country nationals could lodge complaints directly or through designated third parties, such as trade unions or other associations.</p>
<p>As regards the Honourable Member's specific question concerning action by employers to hinder the activity of trade unions, the Commission would point out that freedom of association should be regarded as a general principle of Community law. It is therefore to be respected in any situation falling within the scope of application of Community law.</p>
<p>In the Bosman ruling, the Court of Justice stated that ‘freedom of association, [...] enshrined in Article 11 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and resulting from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, is one of the fundamental rights […] which are protected in the Community legal order. Furthermore, Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that everyone has the right to freedom of association, in particular in trade union matters. The Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers contains a similar provision (Section 13)<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 137(5) of the EC Treaty, the right to adopt measures in the field of social policy does not apply to the right of association. Furthermore, the Commission would emphasise that the EC Treaty does not empower the Commission to take action against private undertakings which may have infringed the right to freedom of association. In such cases, it is for the national authorities, in particular the courts, to ensure that that right is respected within their territory on the basis of all the pertinent facts of the specific case and in accordance with the relevant national, Community and international law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission's President has underlined in his speech before the Parliament on 18 June 2008 that the Lisbon Treaty remains essential to help responding to the challenges that the European Union faces today, such as building a more democratic Union, increasing the powers of the Parliament, recognizing the role of national parliaments, enhancing the Union's capacity to act in areas like migration, energy, climate change and internal security as well as increasing its coherence and effectiveness on the global stage.</p>
<p>As regards industrial policy, Article 157 of the current Treaty establishing the European Community already provides for a clear mandate to pursue an industrial policy on the Community level. This policy aims at providing the right framework conditions for the competitiveness and innovation of our industry taking into account that most businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises. It includes horizontal and sectoral initiatives to assist companies in overcoming the challenges of globalisation, fast technological change, and the adaption to climate change in order to improve their competitiveness and to foster growth, innovation and job creation.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty foresees the following modifications in the new Article 173: “The Commission may take any useful initiative to promote such coordination, in particular initiatives aiming at the establishment of guidelines and indicators, the organisation of exchange of best practice, and the preparation of the necessary elements for periodic monitoring and evaluation. The Parliament shall be kept fully informed.” The Treaty would make the Commission's role in industrial policy more explicit, especially in coordinating its own work with that of the Member States. It would also strengthen the role of the Parliament in achieving the objectives set out in the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty would not, however, result in any fundamental reorientation of the EU’s current industrial policy The changes of the Lisbon Treaty in the area of industrial policy are not indispensable to permit the Commission to continuously pursue this modern industrial policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0441"></a>

<p>The Commission's first general remark partially replies to all four questions concerns the link with the Health Check.This proposal includes policy changes responding to the concerns about food production and the growing food demand: set-aside is proposed to be abolished and the milk quota system will be phased-out. These measures add to the setting to zero of set-aside and the increase of milk quota earlier in 2008, which have already had impacts on this year's production. These production impacts constitute cumulative, important responses to the food security concerns over time. That is why the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), also in the future, is part of the solution to ease the global pressure on food prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Medina Ortega asked for the follow up on the FAO<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Conference on Food Security from 3 to 5 June 2008 in Rome. The Commissioner in charge of Agricultural and Rural Development participated in this conference and the Commission has already responded to the declaration, which asks for an "urgent and coordinated action to combat the negative impacts of soaring food prices on the world's most vulnerable countries and populations". The Commission is also actively engaged to a rapid and successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda. The Commission's commitment is to reach a deal which will be conducive to improving the food situation in developing countries. In addition, and this issue was also raised by the Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid, the Commission is preparing a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries. The EU will support a strong agricultural supply response in developing countries, providing in particular the necessary financing for agricultural inputs and assistance. The Commission is intending to put forward a concrete proposal later in July 2008. This comprehensive package answers also to the questions put forward by Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Ms. McGuinness asks for the Commission's assesment on climate change and its link to sustainable food production. The Commission considers that its effects on agricultural production in Europe differs widely between regions and sectors, whereby there is no single solution to deal with all the concerns the Union is faced with. As the Commissioner in charge of Agriculture and Rural Development said in her answer to the previous questions, the Commission has proposed in the Health Check to address the increasing concerns related to climate change and sustainable food production through Pillar II measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the question of whether the conditions now exist for a successful conclusion to the round by the end of 2008, the Commission thinks it is perfectly imaginable that this deal can be done, and it is doing its best to achieve this goal on the basis of the Council mandate.

<p>Decoupled support is based on historical or regional production references for EU-15 and most reliable data available at the time for EU-10, agreed in the Accession Treaty. Therefore the level of direct aid payment is differentiated not only between old and new Member States, but between all Member States as well as regions and individual farmers (depending on the model of decoupled payment chosen).</p>
<p>The Impact Assessment of the Health Check has shown that the same flat rate payment for all of the EU-27 would not improve the overall "uneven" distribution of payments among farms, but lead to huge budgetary redistributions between Member States. Moreover, it would distort income relations between the farming sector and other sectors of the economy, as agricultural incomes in the EU-12 have already grown strongly since EU accession.</p>
<p>But the Health Check proposal facilitates a move towards a flatter rate of support within a Member State since the redistribution of support it would imply can be targeted by each Member State with more objective criteria. However any major reallocation of funds between Member States can only be considered in the context of the budgetary review and the overall level of fund allocation, not just the one related to direct support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0524"></a>

<p>The Common Agricultural Policy already offers financial assistance to encourage change in agricultural practices. This concerns, for example, replacing old irrigation systems by new ones which are less water-consuming, converting arable into grassland, reducing water use in existing crops, and creating ponds or other features. This assistance is provided, in particular, through agri-environmental measures and support for investments.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has recently made proposals to review the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the so-called Health Check proposals. Some proposed measures would help meeting water quantity concerns. The proposed new standard of good agricultural and environmental conditions will require the respect of authorisation procedures for using water for irrigation. The proposal to increase compulsory modulation up to 13% by 2013 would provide fresh funding for reinforcing their rural development programmes, inter alia for improving water management. In addition the Commission brings to the attention of the Honourable Member that regarding droughts the Commission adopted a Communication on "Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union" in July 2007 which highlights the key policy orientations for future action. This Communication highlights the important water saving potential existing in Europe and the need to exhaust this potential before considering any additional water supply solution. This is valid for agricultural activities and irrigation in particular, where improved irrigation technologies and practices and upgraded irrigation networks can lead to significant amounts of water saved.

<p>On 23 January 2008 the European Commission put forward a far-reaching package of proposals that will deliver on the European Union’s ambitious commitments to fight climate change and promote renewable energy up to 2020 and beyond. Central to the strategy is a strengthening and expansion of the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the EU’s key tool for cutting emissions cost-effectively.</p>
<p>Under any international agreement, the risk of carbon leakage could well be negligible. However, such an agreement is not yet in place.</p>
<p>More information is needed to determine which energy-intensive industries would be most affected by carbon leakage. To this end, DG Enterprise is currently collecting the results from a questionnaire sent out to various different sectors included in the EU ETS.</p>
<p>Given the level of concern on this issue, could the Commissioner please comment on progress to date and indicate any preliminary results he might be able to share with us?</p>

<p>The Commission's overriding priority is to achieve an ambitious and comprehensive international climate agreement for the period post-2012 when the current Kyoto commitments end. In the absence of an international agreement, certain energy-intensive industries risk moving production outside Europe, resulting in increasing global emissions (carbon leakage).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently not in a position to identify precisely the sectors and/or sub-sectors subject to risks of carbon leakage. This task should be performed on the basis of all objective and relevant criteria, notably the ability of the concerned sectors to pass-on increase in costs due to the new rules in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) without losing significant market shares to less carbon efficient installations outside the Community, the ability of these sectors to reduce emissions further and the climate change policies implemented in the countries where competitors are active.</p>
<p>The Commission, therefore, is examining this issue and proposes to determine the sectors or sub-sectors exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage at the latest by June 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission will assess the situation of these energy-intensive industries based on the outcome of the international climate agreement or any sectoral agreements that may have been concluded. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission will submit a report to Parliament and to the Council at the latest by June 2011 and propose any additional measures if necessary. Such measures could cover an adjustment of free allocations or the inclusion of importers in the ETS, or a combination.</p>
<p>The Commission has already started specific work on the issue of carbon leakage. On the basis of a questionnaire which was sent to associations of European industries, the Commission has received data, which is now subject to a detailed analysis and for which an analytical framework is currently being developed.</p>
<p>The objective of the Commission's work in this area is to assess the risk of carbon leakage, taking into account the criteria included in the Commission’s proposal for amending the ETS Directive. The Commission will continue, as was already done at a meeting on 11 April 2008, to inform the stakeholders of the outcome of this work when relevant results are available. One such meeting is provisionally foreseen for the end of September 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will also keep the Parliament and the Council informed of progress made and results obtained from this work, with the aim of reaching an agreement on the Climate and Energy package by the end of 2008.</p>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>According to information received from citizens, UK civil partnerships are not recognised by the French authorities as equivalent to marriage, or even as equivalent to a PACS (French civil partnership). Furthermore, couples registered as civil partners in the UK cannot move to France and enter a PACS, as they need a ‘certificat de coutume’ stating that the partners are not already in a civil/married/PACS relationship in the UK. In the event of the death of one of the civil partners, the French authorities will tax the surviving partner at 60%, and he or she will have no rights under French law. If a French national wishes to enter into a PACS with a British national at the French embassy in London, the ‘certificat de coutume’ is not required even though they are already in a civil partnership with each other in the UK. Article 25 of the double taxation treaty between France and the UK also states that nationals in France and the UK should not be treated differently as regards tax if they are in the same situation.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not think that such a situation is an obstacle to free movement of citizens and their families and that these different requirements relating to the ‘certificat de coutume’ and to tax laws constitute discrimination based on sexual orientation? What will the Commission do to overcome this situation?

<p>The Honourable Member draws the attention of the Commission to the difficulties on the non-recognition by the French authorities of the United Kingdom civil partnerships, as equivalent to marriage, or to PACS<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Mutual recognition in the area of family law is indeed a priority for the Commission. Currently, Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (the Brussels II a Regulation) represents the main legal instrument dealing with mutual recognition in the area of family law. The Brussels II a Regulation provides for the mutual recognition of certain judgments relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment.</p>
<p>However, there is no existing Community legislation providing for the recognition of marriages or same-sex civil partnerships across the European Union. Consequently, the Commission has no competence to examine whether there is discrimination between married couples and couples engaged in a civil partnership.</p>
<p>Differences perceived in some Member States, relating to the way they deal with civil partnerships concluded in other Member States, and their tax effects, are a consequence of a lack of unified rules on the recognition of marriages and civil partnerships in the European Union.</p>
<p>The European Community does not hold any power to adopt legislation on issues linked to civil status, which have a direct impact on the daily life of European citizens. As long as no additional powers are conferred on the Community, the Commission has no legal basis to act in this area.</p>
<p>However, a comparative study on civil status records has been launched by the Commission, to answer the need for mutual recognition of these records, caused by the increasing mobility of citizens within the European Union. This field is currently governed by national law and international conventions. The objective of this comparative study is to provide an overview of the national laws and practices in this field, to identify the practical problems encountered by citizens and indicate possible solutions to these problems. This extensive study is expected to be completed in the course of 2008. It will provide the Commission with a solid basis for assessing possible measures that could be taken at European Union level to improve the mutual recognition of civil status records. In order to redress the fact that the lack of mutual recognition result in adverse personal and financial consequences for the citizens concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the eyes of Greek consumers, the single market has totally failed to harmonise prices, in particular of basic consumer goods. For many years the consumer price index in Greece has been one of the highest in EU-15 and significantly higher than the Community average. Recently the consumer protection centre conducted a price survey of 86 articles of everyday usage in the same supermarket chain in Berlin and in Thessaloniki. This survey showed that the average price overall in the Thessaloniki store was 32.57% higher than in Berlin with many products being 100% more expensive.</p>
<p>In cases of uncontrolled pricing in intrafirm trade, what resources does the Greek government have to bring levels down to EU levels? What means does it have to put an end to uncontrolled pricing in intrafirm trade?

<p>The primary objective of EC competition policy is to make markets work better for the benefit of consumers in the EU. The Commission cooperates closely with the National Competition Authorities (NCA) of each Member State regarding the application of EC competition rules (within the framework of Council Regulation 1/2003) to ensure that markets work for the benefit of consumers. Investigations arise whenever the alleged anticompetitive practices are backed by legal and economic evidence.</p>
<p>It must, however, be noted that price differences across different Member States are not necessarily linked to a deficiency in the application of competition rules. Indeed, a number of key factors can have a considerable impact on price formation. The observed price differences may result from a combination of supply-side factors at EU and world levels (structural developments, climatic conditions etc) and demand-side drivers (rise in global commodity demand, changes in dietary patterns, emergence of new markets etc.) or from the structure and the functioning of the retail and distribution sector in each Member State. Such factors include for instance consumer preferences in the relevant markets, tradability of certain goods/services and cost components (cost of infrastructure, human resources etc).</p>
<p>NCAs are well placed to address issues pertaining specifically to the functioning of the retail sector and/or food supply chain within their territories. In particular, the impact of rising consumer prices may be mitigated by ensuring sufficient level of competition, as well as by reducing unjustified regulation that is capable of restricting competition to the detriment of consumers, in the retail sector of each Member State.</p>
<p>EC competition rules prohibit arrangements between competing firms designed to limit or eliminate competition between them, by fixing prices, limiting output, sharing markets, allocating customers or territories, bid rigging or a combination of these specific types of competition. To the extent that intrafirm-specific practices are liable to distort competition (and, in particular, retail prices), competition rules prohibit anti-competitive business practices which a dominant firm may use in order to maintain or strengthen its position in the market. In this context, charging a price that is excessive in relation to the economic value of the product(s) concerned (excessive/exploitative pricing) has been established as a form of abusive conduct.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to monitor the development of comparative price levels. The levels and differences of consumer prices between the Member States are also monitored in the annual Consumer Markets Scoreboard. The first edition of the Scoreboard was published in the beginning of 2008 and the exercise will be carried out yearly. Some price differences, especially in the case of non-tradable goods and services, may be due to differences of income between the Member States. Nevertheless, particularly important differences between the Member States may also suggest the need for further scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Commission's Single Market Review has identified retail trade as one of the sectors that warrants in-depth market monitoring given its key role for consumer and supplier markets and its current level of fragmentation. A monitoring report will be prepared for 2009 to analyse the possible reasons for malfunctioning of retail services seen the perspectives of both consumers and suppliers.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a Communication on "Tackling the challenge of rising food prices. Directions for EU action" on 20 May 2008<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This suggests several initiatives to mitigate the impact of the increased food prices in the EU, namely to Monitor price developments; Adjust the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); Act for the most deprived persons; Investigate the functioning of the food supply chain. The Commission will set up a task force to examine the functioning of the food supply chain, including concentration and market segmentation of the food retail and distribution sectors in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-1666_EN.html">E-1666/08</a>, the Commission pointed out that it 'shares … concern with regard to incitement to hatred broadcast under the jurisdiction of one of the Member States.' Hamas’ TV station Al-Aqsa uses European satellite capacity of the French company Eutelsat’s Atlantic Bird 4, which Eutelsat leases to the Jordanian satellite provider Noorsat, to incite violence and hatred and justify terrorism in Europe and beyond. As on Hezbollah’s TV station Al-Manar, on Al-Aqsa programming children dress up as suicide bombers and are presented as heroes. In one segment, Assud, a popular bunny character, advocates martyrdom and suicide bombings as the ideal goal for every child who phones into the show. In another segment the cartoon character says that he will 'bite and eat up' the Danes because a Danish newspaper published political cartoons they did not like. Assud the bunny accepts a phone call on the show from someone who says that 'we will manage to kill, to assassinate' the cartoonist, to which Assud wholeheartedly agrees.</p>
<p>What is the Commission planning to prevent Al-Aqsa broadcasting on European satellite capacity? Given the similarities between Al-Manar and the incitement to violence and terrorism broadcast on Al Aqsa, does this not amount to a violation of Article 3b ('Incitement to hatred') of the revised Audiovisual Without Frontiers Directive (Directive 2007/65/EC<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>), as was the case with 'Al-Manar'?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Members concerns with regard to programmes containing incitement to hatred falling under the jurisdiction of one Member State. It actively cooperates with, and promotes cooperation between, the Member States in order to ensure the full application of Community law in this particularly sensitive area.</p>
<p>Article 22a of Directive 89/552/EEC prohibits broadcasts inciting to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality. It should also be recalled that the right of freedom of expression is a cornerstone of a democratic and pluralist society.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Al-Aqsa TV is transmitted via Atlantic Bird 4 belonging to the French based satellite operator Eutelsat. However, the Commission has not received so far any formal complaint regarding the programmes broadcasted by Al-Aqsa TV.</p>
<p>Where a non-EU broadcaster falls under the jurisdiction of a Member State by virtue of the criteria laid down by the Directive, it is, in the first instance, the task of the national authorities in question to ensure that broadcasts by this broadcaster comply with the rules of the Directive, notably the ban on incitement to hatred based on race, sex, religion or nationality. Hence, it is in first instance within the remit of the French regulator, the Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), to monitor whether the programmes broadcast by Al-Aqsa TV contain incitement to hatred and to take the appropriate measures. Contrary to the case of the TV channel Al Manar, according to the assessment made by the CSA, there is not enough evidence to justify a total ban of the channel Al-Aqsa. So far, the Commission has no reason to put into question the assessment carried out by the CSA.</p>
<p>In view notably of the impact that the assessment of the regulatory authority in one Member State may have on other Member States, the Commission has taken steps to ensure a fruitful and efficient cooperation between Member States' regulatory authorities and provides a forum for exchange of information between regulators. The Commission notably refers to the meeting chaired by the Commissioner in charge of Information Society and Media in March 2005 in the context of the prohibition of the broadcast of Al Manar by the French regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>The Commission will raise the issue of Al-Aqsa TV in the context of the next meeting with national regulatory authorities before the summer break in 2008 and will inform the Honourable Member of the outcome of this meeting subsequently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Convening the first ever subcommittee on political matters was a major step towards deepening political relations with Egypt and towards building confidence in the process of political dialogue through which the Commission will also raise issues of shared concern in a constructive manner based on mutual trust and respect.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Members that material broadcast by the mentioned television station in question might amount to incitement to hatred. The sub-committee on political matters with Egypt is indeed the appropriate mechanism for raising issues related to the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance. This includes the undertaking in the joint EU-Egypt Action Plan to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>However, in light of the many other pressing political and human rights developments that had to be addressed, as well as the EU’s agreed priorities for this dialogue, it was decided with the Member States that the issue of incitement to hatred via media would not yet be discussed in this very first sub-committee meeting.</p>
<p>The Commission does of course continue to pay close attention to this issue and may raise it on another occasion under the EU’s regular political dialogue with Egypt.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Under the Regulation, the disposal of Category 1 animal by-products may take place in an approved incineration plant which is operating according to the Waste Incineration Directive.</p>
<p>Each Member State must have a disposal system in place which is capable of handling the amount of animal by-products arising on its territory.</p>
<p>Operators of incineration plants have to respect the applicable legal requirements, and they are subject to official controls by the Member States' competent authorities.</p>
<p>The Regulation on animal by-products defines as competent authority the central authority of a Member State or another authority to which the competence to ensure compliance with the Regulation has been delegated.</p>
<p>The Waste Incineration Directive does not define the competent authority but describes some of its tasks. The Directive requires competent authorities to assess the applications for permits to operate waste incineration and co-incineration plants. The competent authorities are responsible for granting permits including measures to ensure that the requirements of the Directive are met and to periodically reconsider and, where necessary, update permit conditions. Competent authorities shall also take action to enforce compliance if the plant does not comply with the permit conditions, in particular with the emission limit values laid down in the Directive.</p>

<p>The Commission's response to increases in food prices and increases in oil prices has been set out in two recent Communications that steered the discussion with Member States at the meeting of the European Council on 19 and 20 June 2008. The Commission would like to underline the support that was given to the Commission's approach by the European Council.</p>
<p>Concerning oil, rising prices are largely the result of major structural shifts in the global economy. We are moving away from the era of cheap and easily available oil. This trend is inevitable and generally/globally applicable. This calls for a clear distinction between short term measures to alleviate the hardship on vulnerable sectors of society, and longer term measures to accompany and promote the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>Governments in consumer countries, and increasingly in producer countries, have little influence on prices in global oil markets in the short term. Political pressure from citizens and companies therefore focuses on subsidies to help vulnerable groups to afford energy at a time of rising prices. A balance is needed to ensure that targeted, time-limited support to the vulnerable does not send the signal to suppliers that taxpayers are prepared to absorb price rises, rather than pass these on to the consumer. It is equally important to ensure that the incentive provided by the high price to save and change our energy consumption is transmitted to all users, while complementing policy measures should focus on energy savings and energy efficiency improvements. It is therefore necessary to avoid fiscal measures or other public interventions that could have distorting effects as they prevent economic actors from undertaking the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>It is also important to improve cooperation between oil producing and oil consuming countries in order to clarify how the market is functioning and avoid future price volatility. The example of the recent summit in Jeddah should be followed up. At the same time, our existing dialogues with key suppliers such as Russia, Norway and OPEC<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will be reinforced. Increased transparency on oil stocks could also help. In this respect, the Commission will continue to study the feasibility of ensuring public availability of data on commercial stocks and will present a proposal for the revision of the existing Community legislation on emergency stocks by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As the European Council confirmed, the appropriate response to high oil prices is a structural shift of the European energy system towards clean forms of energy and a more efficient use of energy. The Commission's proposal from 23<span class="sup">rd</span> of January 2008 on the climate and energy package provides for a shift towards a low-carbon economy. This will reduce Europe's energy imports and make it less vulnerable to market fluctuations. With the rising price of energy, the benefits of the climate and energy package are ever more obvious and its adoption is therefore a priority for the Commission and should be shared by Parliament and Member States.</p>
<p>The EU should take the challenge of energy efficiency more seriously if we wish to reach the objective of saving 20% of energy consumption by 2020. The Commission will continue to push for full implementation of the existing energy efficiency action plan with the Member States. Later in 2008, the Commission will present a proposal for the recast of the directive on the energy performance of buildings.</p>
<p>Concerning food prices, the EU has already acted. It temporarily suspended the obligation to set aside 10 percent of arable land for the 2008 harvest, increased milk quotas by 2 percent and temporarily suspended import duties on most cereals. The reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) allows our farmers more and more to base their production decisions on what the market is telling them rather than on where they get the biggest subsidy. That is because subsidies are increasingly delinked from production. The Health Check of the CAP will further remove restrictions on farmers to allow them to react flexibly to growing demand. It will abolish permanently set-aside, further reduce the role of market intervention, and phase out milk quotas gradually between now and 2015. Most remaining production-linked subsidies will be decoupled from production, so that farmers are largely free to produce what the market requires.</p>
<p>Three specific actions should be mentioned in particular. Firstly, the Commission will soon put forward a proposal for a Regulation establishing a rapid response instrument to the food price crisis in developing countries. The Commission foresees a time-limited instrument that would be strictly related to agricultural production in the countries that are hardest hit. This will use unspent resources from the agricultural budget to stimulate home-grown production in developing countries. Secondly, in order to address the concerns of the most vulnerable people inside the EU, the Commission will propose a Regulation for the revision of the food aid programme in order to increase the amount of funding available. The goal is to increase support; to ensure it is targeted to the most needy, and to ensure that the right mix of commodities is covered. Thirdly, the Commission will carry out an examination of the food supply chain, monitor the evolution of prices and further analyse developments in financial markets related to commodities.</p>
<p>Concerning the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, the Commission would recall that its last report on the strategy noted the role of renewable energies and low-carbon and resource-efficient products, services and technologies. Increased oil prices demonstrate that it is in the interest of the European economy to implement the shift towards a low carbon economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Opposition voices are strong also in the media, where they are represented by influential periodicals such as ‘El Nuevo Siglo’ and ‘Semana’.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that links between politicians and officials and Colombia’s armed groups strike at the very heart of the country’s democracy. It is therefore crucial that such connections, be they with the former paramilitaries, for which over 60 parliamentarians have already been indicted, or with the guerrilla groups, are investigated fully and sanctioned appropriately. This is a task which should be carried out by the Colombian judicial authorities, acting with their constitutionally guaranteed independence and in full impartiality and neutrality.</p>
<p>While freedom of opinion is guaranteed by the Colombian constitution, its exercise in practice is limited by the threats and attacks against journalists and human rights defenders. Despite government efforts and resulting improvements, Colombia remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world for these groups. There has been a new wave of threats and aggressions since the start of 2008, which is very preoccupying, not least since it has i.a. affected a number of persons closely linked to the EU cooperation programme in Colombia, notably to the EC-funded “peace laboratories” active in Magdalena Medio and in other regions.</p>
<p>The Commission has regularly expressed its concerns vis-à-vis the Colombian government. The threats and attacks against human right defenders have been the subject of a recent démarche of EU Troika Ambassadors in Bogotá, as well as of the declaration by the EU Presidency which the Honourable Member refers to, issued on 19 May 2008. They were also raised by the Commission’s Director General for External Relations when he visited Colombia in mid-May 2008.</p>
<p>Following the declaration, EU Heads of Mission in Bogotá have carried out a visit to Magdalena Medio, during which they met with human rights defenders, community leaders and civil society representatives and expressed the support of the EU for the work of the persons and organisations concerned, as well as EU solidarity in face of the threats they have received. Similar meetings have also taken place in Bogotá.</p>
<p>In order to help protect persons working at grassroots level, the Commission’s Delegation in Bogotá has organised a meeting with representatives of EC-funded projects and the EC’s Regional Security Officer, where recommendations related to the security of project workers were provided. The Peace Laboratory in Magdalena Medio has equally taken some preventive measures, including the temporary departure of project leaders and experts from the southern Bolívar region.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to support human rights defenders through its cooperation programme. It is, amongst others, supporting journalism at regional level through its peace laboratories; at national level, it is co-financing an emblematic alternative TV programme (Contravía, run by the well-known journalist Hollman Morris, who has been among the recipient of recent death threats). The EC is also supporting the work of the judiciary, through some large-scale activities aiming at strengthening the capacity of the Attorney General’s office and the Supreme Court, aimed at assisting them to deal with the cases of the victims of Colombia’s internal conflict.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0492"></a>

<p>On 28 December 2006 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers decided to suspend the tender procedure for the exploration of natural resources in the Black Sea shelf in response to breaches of the law by one of the tendering firms, Melrose Resources SARL, Luxembourg. Almost one year later, on 6 December 2007, the Council of Ministers adopted Decision 2007/848 awarding the exploration contract to that very firm, Melrose Resources. The fact that this decision represented a breach of the official procedure and the illogical actions on the part of the Council of Ministers have given rise to suspicions of corruption at the highest levels of the Bulgarian State, suspicions confirmed by the attitude of Bulgaria’s Supreme Administrative Court and the State Prosecutor’s Office. The Supreme Administrative Court refused to collect evidence against the Council of Ministers, the likely reason being political pressure. Although information pointing to a criminal offence had been submitted to the State Prosecutor’s Office, it halted the legal proceedings without carrying out proper investigations.</p>
<p>What measures will the Commission take to provide the monitoring urgently needed in connection with this scandalous case involving the abuse of administrative power and a refusal to institute proper legal proceedings?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the basis of the question of the Honourable Member, it appears that the contract in question concerns exploration of natural resources. According to Article 7 of Directive 2004/17/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, contracts concerning activities relating to the exploitation of a geographical area "for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil, gas, coal or other solid fuels" are covered by this Directive.</p>
<p>However, it appears from the question of the Honourable Member that the award procedure in question was already on-going in 2006, i.e. before Bulgaria's accession to the European Union. From the information provided, the procedure was merely suspended in December 2006 and there is nothing to indicate that the procedure was officially terminated or ended. The contract was later awarded on 6 December 2007. Therefore, as the procedure was already on-going before Bulgaria's accession to the European Union, the EC public procurement directives do not apply to it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0495"></a>

<p>Since the entry into force of Regulation No 915/2007, a number of third countries have expressed an interest in having an exemption from the Community general rules on LAGs.</p>
<p>So far, such an exemption has been granted only to Singapore. The Commission shares the disappointment of the Honourable Members that more third country airports have not been exempted. However, it has thus far been impossible for the Commission to grant any further exemptions to airports in other third countries, since none has yet provided all the information required to satisfy the verification process.</p>
<p>The speed of the process of granting equivalence for the security provisions at third country airports is determined largely by the third country itself. In order to be granted equivalence they must demonstrate that their security standards are equivalent, which includes analysis of the national legislation and other pertinent information. In addition, they shall be applying the recommended security control guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation for screening liquids, gels and aerosols and using tamper-evident bags for liquids sold at the airport. After the analysis of this information the Commission may supplement it by means of an inspection.</p>
<p>Whilst many third countries have expressed an interest in having their airports added to the list of exempted airports few have provided this information to substantiate their case or, in some cases, have regrettably not introduced the use of tamper-evident bags in airport shops.</p>
<p>In order to speed up matters, the Commission has made clear to the third countries concerned that it is of first importance that they provide the necessary information and/or guarantees on the structure of security at their airports that is adversely affecting the speed of progress.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 16 June 2008, the Association Council took a decision on upgrading EU-Israel relations with a view to bringing about enhanced political dialogue, more economic cooperation, a significant degree of integration into the European internal market and collaboration in the field of justice and home affairs. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner admitted to the press that the text had been deliberately kept vague. A European Parliament delegation which visited the region at the start of June unanimously took the view that, because of the ongoing conflict, there can be no such upgrading now. Gaza is still an open-air jail. Israel is continuing to build settlements. Construction of the wall is proceeding. The President of the European Parliament wrote to the Commissioner on 29 May 2008 to request that Parliament be informed about, and consulted on, possible EU proposals to the Association Council. To date, this has not taken place in any shape or form.</p>

<p>The Commission, in its Communication on the European Neighbourghood Policy (ENP) to the Parliament and Council of April 2008, had already spelled out its views on the development of more intense and fruitful relations with our ENP partners on the basis of the principle of differentiation, mentioning Israel’s as one of the frontrunners in the ENP. Any further development of bilateral relations with Israel will remain in this ENP framework.</p>
<p>Ministers, in their statement of 16 June 2008 – which is a public document – have stated that the development of relations with Israel is to be seen in the context of the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>The Association Council with Israel, on 16 June 2008, saw the start of a process. This process is not leading to a new form of association, but will be based on our existing Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel.</p>
<p>The EU and Israel have identified areas of mutual interest for deepened cooperation which are listed in the EU statement. Discussions on these will take place over the coming months.

<p>The issue of terrorism associated with the Khalistan movement, seeking independence for a Sikh nation (Khalistan), needs first to be seen in the larger context of Punjab’s recent political history. The Indian state of Punjab, marred by violence for over 15 years due to Sikh separatists in the 1980s, returned to normalcy after the movement was successfully handled in the mid-1990s. After years of direct rule from New Delhi, the democratic process was successfully revived with a democratically elected government in 1997. The latest State election in 2007 resulted in putting back the Akali Dal party (representing exclusively the interests of the Sikhs) at the helm.</p>
<p>There have been various press reports indicating that a surviving network of terrorism continues to exist, in particular outside India, which can partly explain how Sikh militants did manage to trigger a bomb blast inside a cinema hall in Ludhiana (seven dead, including a 10-year old child, and 40 injured) on 14 October 2007. The Commission’s analysis, however, is that the ideology that inspired a decade and a half of terrorism in Punjab has been rejected by the population.</p>
<p>In reply to the Honourable Members questions, the Commission believes that best way to caution Member States about the risk of being exploited by extremist Khalistani groups is to invite them to follow closely EU-India joint efforts in the fight against terrorism and to support meetings between the EU working group on terrorism and Indian experts as well as Indian requests to increase cooperation with Europol.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0504"></a>

<p>Over recent years, an increasing number of state-owned industrial plants have come under private ownership, particularly in the new Member States. Unfortunately, no one has given any thought to what is to be done with the manufacturing waste left behind. That waste poses a serious threat to the environment and public health. In the majority of cases, once they have purchased the plants, the new owners do not have enough money to recycle (destroy) the waste left behind, and no monies are available for this purpose from the state. Owing to a lack of domestic legislation on waste and the huge costs involved in destroying the waste, the owners are simply sitting idly by. Should this state of affairs continue, in a couple of years' time it may be too difficult to bring the situation under control.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to take any action in this matter?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The management of waste, including manufacturing waste, needs to comply with the provisions of the relevant Community legislation, including in particular Directive 2006/12/EC on waste<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. According to this Directive, Member States shall take all the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. In particular, waste recovery and disposal must be carried out without risk to water, air, soil, plants or animals, without causing nuisance through noise or odours, and without adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest. This Directive specifies that, in accordance with the "polluter pays" principle, the cost of disposing of waste must be borne by (a) the holder who has the waste handled by a waste collector or by a waste disposal undertaking; and/or (b) the previous holder or the producer of the product from which the waste came.</p>
<p>Some manufacturing waste may be hazardous. Hazardous wastes pose a greater risk to the environment and human health than non hazardous wastes and thus require a stricter control regime. In such a case, the provisions of Directive 91/689/EC on hazardous waste<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> would apply, including additional record keeping, monitoring and control obligations from the “cradle to the grave”, from the waste producer to the final disposal or recovery.</p>
<p>Member States should ensure that all the requirements of the abovementioned legislation are transposed into national legislation and complied with. The Commission regularly monitors the transposition of the Community waste legislation by the Member States. In case of non-transposition into national law, incorrect transposition, or non-compliance with the relevant Community legislation, the Commission can and does take legal steps against the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>As regards the costs of implementing the Community waste legislation, these should be decided on a case-by-case basis by the national competent authorities. Member States can financially contribute to the recovery or disposal of industrial waste, especially where it is no longer possible to identify the current or previous holder or producer of the waste. To this end, Member States can use their own resources or Community funding in line with the applicable procedures.</p>
<p>Community financing of environmental priorities is planned under the major operational programme Infrastructure and Environment of the Cohesion Policy 2007-2013 and 16 regional operational programmes in Poland. For example, there will be approximately € 8.8 billion (about 13.5% of overall funding for 2007-13 programming period) available for the environment and risk prevention projects in Poland, out of which € 1.3 billion is allocated to the waste sector (2% of overall funding) under the category "Management of household and industrial waste". Each new Member State will have its own allocation. Despite these resources, there will be still a significant financial gap for the implementation of the EU legislation, including waste directives, which have transitional periods set up by the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>As concerns waste management, support from the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme will be given to initiatives preventing or limiting the production of municipal waste, introducing recycling technologies and technologies for neutralising municipal waste, as well as eliminating danger of waste disposal, in accordance with national and regional waste management plans, as well as initiatives in the field of rehabilitation of post-industrial and post-military land. As regards land rehabilitation, support is available for large area projects in non-urbanized areas and only in situations when the current land owner is not responsible for the occurrence of pollution or degradation of the environment.</p>
<p>Within this Operational Programme, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be also eligible for support to comply with environmental requirements. The assistance will aim, inter alia, to reduce the amount of generated waste other than municipal waste and increase the level of waste reclamation and recycling, as well as to increase the recovery of post-production and dangerous waste.</p>
<p>The funding to the Infrastructure and Environment Operational Programme will be provided by regional operational programmes which can support waste management projects, provided that they are included in the regional waste management plans. Regional operational programmes will also co-finance assistance to SMEs in the area of waste management. For example, they can support systems for environmental management, rationalization of resources and waste management, industrial waste management and dangerous waste management, as well as the implementation of the Best Available Techniques (BAT).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The main purpose is to set minimum energy efficiency requirements that lamps used for general lighting (including incandescent lamps) would have to fulfil in order to be placed on the EU market.
