I would like to welcome those in the gallery who are the authors of the petition that formed the basis for today’s debate. Mr Krzysztof Mączkowski is there, who represents many ecological organisations, and, I think, Mrs Morkunaite from Lithuania. The petition was signed by nearly 30 000 people. Signatures keep coming in to the Committee on Petitions. This debate is, without any doubt, being watched by many millions and by public opinion in all the countries on the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of this petition in the European Parliament was that, first of all, we had a number of discussions on this subject within the Committee on Petitions. These discussions were based on extremely strong presentations made by the authors of the petition. In total we had five debates on this subject. We also organised a public hearing. During the public hearing world-renowned specialists discussed and upheld what the petitioners had said: that the threat to the natural environment of the Baltic is enormous and whether it is at all worthwhile to take such a gamble on such a huge investment. While these discussions were going on in the Committee on Petitions and when the European Parliament agreed for the issue to be debated publicly, which is what is happening today, additional debates took place in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The texts put forward for approval obtained ninety percent support in the Committee on Petitions and in both the other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only then that, suddenly, there was significant activity among the opponents and critics of this report and the arguments contained in it. Suddenly 180 amendments were submitted to the Committee on Petitions. Almost all of them were rejected. A similar experience faced the advisory committees. One could see this immense offensive – there is no other way to describe it – by Nord Stream. We received voting instructions prepared by Nord Stream; that was in the Committee on Petitions. I have worked in the European Parliament for four years and this is the first time in my experience that anyone involved in lobbying actually told Members how to vote and put forward amendment after amendment: abstain on this one, vote ‘yes’ to this one, vote ‘no’ to that one.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is based on 40 different opinions and expert reports. Ladies and gentlemen, there are three parties in this consideration: the ordinary citizens of the Union, enormous political and economic capital, and the European Parliament. The European Parliament should speak for the ordinary citizens of the European Union. Let us learn from the lesson of what happened in the referenda in France, the Netherlands and Ireland. We want to gain the trust of ordinary citizens in the European Union and I hope that this will be the attitude of all the Members in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those who helped us get to the point where we can actually have this debate today. I would like to thank Mrs Foltyn-Kubicka, who has prepared a wonderful exhibition here in the European Parliament on the Baltic Sea, Mr Cashman, who is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, and Mr Beazley, who is the Chairman of the Baltic-Europe Intergroup in the European Parliament. I would also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, including David Lowe, Karen Chioti and Silvia Cannalire, as well as those who have given me advice, help and cooperation: Szymon Szynkowski, Norbert Napierajów, Wojciech Danecki, Witold Ziobrze and Michał Krupiński. These are the people who had the greatest input into this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission. – (EL) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki, for his report, which allows us to discuss the environmental impact of this large project, a natural gas pipeline of 1 200 km in length, which will be crossing a shallow sea such as the Baltic. This is not just because this is an important project, raising many questions on environmental protection in the Baltic area, but also because this appears to be the first of many similar projects planned for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The project has already attracted considerable attention from the media and from politicians throughout the Baltic region over the last few months. It has been discussed at many forums and in many of the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Libicki mentioned, it was also discussed in the European Parliament in January at a public hearing organised by the Committee on Petitions, in which I participated together with Mr Piebalgs, my fellow Commissioner, who is responsible for energy matters, . Commissioner Piebalgs gave an overview of the prospects of the European Union with regard to natural gas and stressed that the needs of the European Union in gas are rapidly increasing, while the production of gas in the European Union is falling dramatically and stocks are being used up.</p>
<p class="contents">Our energy policy for Europe highlights the urgent need to promote an improvement in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and we are working towards that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant increases in natural gas imports will, however, still be needed to cover Europe’s energy requirements in coming decades. Additional infrastructure, such as natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals, will play a significant role in meeting the needs of European consumers and in ensuring a constant supply. The Nord Stream pipeline will make it possible to increase the supply of natural gas from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the need to construct new infrastructure for the transportation of Russian gas to the European Union has been acknowledged by the European Parliament and by the Council through the guidelines for trans-European energy networks, adopted in September 2006. I am specifically referring to Decision No 1364/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The guidelines specified certain priority projects and this project is classified as a project of European interest and, therefore, as a top priority. Provided that the environmental impact study reaches positive conclusions, the Nord Stream pipeline will be a project of European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">My main point during the European Parliament hearing in January was that the project, just like any other project, must follow all the relevant environmental rules of international and Community law during its construction, operation and monitoring stages. This is also the point I wish to make today.</p>
<p class="contents">According to international and Community law, then, the project owner, namely Nord Stream AG, must apply for an implementation permit or for a construction permit from the countries which have jurisdiction over the works to be carried out, these countries being Germany, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The grant of an implementation permit for such projects is, however, subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure. This is also stipulated in the guidelines for trans-European energy networks I mentioned earlier. The environmental impact assessment procedures are laid down both in Community and in international law. There is a relevant EU directive, as well as the Espoo Convention at cross-border level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Espoo Convention is part of Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, given that both the Community and the Member States are parties to the Convention. In this case, the procedures of both Community and national law apply. The project’s cross-border nature means that the Espoo Convention must be adhered to, while the Member States involved must properly enforce the provisions of the directive on environmental impact assessments before granting an implementation permit.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental impact procedure based on the Espoo Convention started with the project’s disclosure in late 2006. According to the information held by the Commission, numerous studies, reports and matters have been discussed at various forums and meetings, both with the public and with the competent authorities in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As is stipulated in the Espoo Convention, the contractor or project owner must provide the appropriate documentation regarding the environmental impact. At the same time, the country with the authority to issue the implementation permit, the country of origin, the party of origin as it is referred to in the Espoo Convention, has the following two duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it must hold talks with the environmental authorities and with the public affected and, secondly, it must initiate talks with the affected party or parties, meaning the neighbouring countries, which may be subject to the project’s cross-border impact. In this case, the affected parties are the three Baltic States and Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, due compliance with the environmental impact procedure means that all the concerns, questions and important issues, such as those mentioned in the report we are discussing today, must be evaluated and discussed both by the competent authorities and by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present phase, any emphasis placed on a potential negative environmental impact which cannot be mitigated or avoided, as laid down in the environmental impact legislation, is premature. In fact, the final environmental impact assessment report has not yet been drafted. Therefore, the environmental authorities have not yet had the chance to analyse and evaluate all the technical data necessary for providing answers to all the legitimate questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of origin have a legal right to demand all the supplementary information which they deem to be necessary in order for them to be able to grant, if they so decide, an implementation permit; for instance, Sweden has already done so, when the project owner submitted a formal request in order to comply with the national legal requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the affected parties also have a legal right to ensure that they hold all the information necessary to meet their needs. I have been informed that all the parties involved, meaning both the parties of origin and the affected parties, are regularly holding meetings and discussions on the developments in the environmental impact procedure based on the Espoo Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The final environmental impact report is expected by the end of the year. After it has been submitted, the formal talks will take place, and these will determine the final decision on whether or not an implementation permit is granted.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect that the competent authorities in all the Member States, which are parties to the Espoo Convention, will perform their duties and assume their responsibilities as they ought to.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia, which has signed the Espoo Convention but is not a party to it, has nonetheless agreed to abide to its rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to stress that we are monitoring developments and that we are in contact with the responsible parties of the Espoo Convention, with the parties involved and with the contractor. With regard to the contractor, the Commission authorities have made it clear that all the obligations pertaining to the necessary information and to the transparency required must be honoured.</p>

<p class="contents">30 000 signatures demonstrate the concern there is around the coast of the Baltic Sea, which has been described as a sea dying of pollution. It is very shallow. At the bottom, it still has military vessels from the Second World War. The question is: Is it really the most sensible thing to drive an energy pipeline along the bottom of this particular part of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">I have the honour of writing the opinion for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and, as well as the environmental issues which the Committee on Petitions has looked at, we were also concerned about the nature of the environmental assessment study which the Commission has just referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in your reply could you confirm that you will accept Parliament’s paragraph 20 of the Libicki report, which calls upon you and the Commission to carry out an independent environmental assessment? There is some concern that if the proposers commission an environmental assessment it might lack objectivity.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on all littoral states around the Baltic Sea – all nine, including Russia – to be fully consulted and also to be fully involved in the maintenance and security of such a pipeline were it to be constructed. The Commission has already stressed the importance of recognition of international and European law and we would add that liability by the company is also necessary. The appropriate insurance should be taken out to cover any potential risk or damage caused by the project, either in its construction or thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we insist upon the principle of reciprocity. Yesterday’s failed attempt to remove the BP-TNK chief executive by Russian partners does not bode well for mutual understanding between EU companies and Russian companies. We look for harmony in this exercise, but we also look for the Commission to follow this project very carefully, and as the rapporteur has pointed out, and two Commissioners to the hearing, the current proposal as tabled by Nord Stream is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to finish by saying that my group will be voting in favour of the Libicki report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swiss company Nord Stream failed to submit an environmental impact assessment by the permitted deadline, leaving the European Parliament to vote blind.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also become apparent that the environmental impact assessment commissioned by Nord Stream only incorporated the new research problems after Parliament pointed out major failings in its research plans. The most important problem with the EIA are the wrecks of tens of warships which were sunk in battle, with their munitions, in the Gulf of Finland in August 1941; this is something which was only admitted by Duma Member Andrei Klimov ten days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, however, it was reported that the route was fully clear. Special focus must be placed on phosphorus released when bottom sediment is disturbed: although the EIA states that it has no bearing on eutrophication, other schools of thought beg to differ. We must also anticipate that dioxins and heavy metals will be released. The latter are relevant in terms of food preparation using fish which contain substances toxic to humans. We already know that the level of these substances and radioactivity are highest in the Baltic Sea as it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to this project and the report by Mr Libicki, I would like to say that in general three aspects should be taken into consideration here. The first is the economic aspect. It is clear that energy resources are necessary both for Germany and for Europe, and from this viewpoint the gas pipeline from Russia is necessary, since Russia owns the gas resources. The second is the political aspect. That means the way in which this project was prepared, and we all know that it was done with great political string-pulling, before the elections, without consultations with the states that might be affected from an economic or environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as we know, according to EU strategy in the energy sphere, provision has been made for the compatibility of energy channels. Here, nothing of the kind has been provided, and so in fact it does not comply with the EU strategy for energy solidarity and energy security that we have now accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the environmental aspect, which is what the Libicki report deals with specifically. As we know, according to the Global Environment Facility’s report, 7 of the 10 most polluted locations in the world’s oceans are in the Baltic Sea. From this point of view it seems to me that there has been very little debate – I acknowledge, of course, that the companies implementing the project have made calculations and held debates – but in public another alternative has not been debated, and that is to place the gas pipeline on a land route. This would make it much easier to achieve compatibility and would in fact resolve two aspects – the environmental aspect and the strategic and political aspect. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is in keeping with the authority of Parliament that we stick to the facts in the resolutions. The fact is that the EU needs Russian gas and that Russia needs even more European customers.</p>
<p class="contents">The second fact is that the project being negotiated now has been approved by the EU as part of the TEN programme. It is a large construction project, the implementation of which may have a harmful impact on the ecosystem of the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason it is important to have impartial environmental reports produced, so that the risks may be established and weighed up against the benefits. There are no projects without risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group’s proposed amendments to the report are based on the principle that no concessions be made on the environment, but that no artificial barriers be constructed either.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a fact that the greatest environmental problem facing the Baltic at the moment is agriculture in the surrounding countries, and the transportation of oil by ship, which is becoming more common, is a real risk. However, we do not discuss these problems in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a fact that the negotiations on the pipeline have been politicised to such an extent that there is a danger of the matter itself remaining a side-issue. The observation of former President Putin that the Russian fleet also has to protect financial interests does not help to create a climate of confidence. The use of energy for political pressure is not a civilised way of holding international dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland has experienced pressure from Russia in the form of duties on timber, but at least for the time being the Finnish government has not bound this matter up with the gas pipeline project.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has not ratified the Espoo Convention on the Baltic. Russia should be required to do this before construction of the pipeline can begin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is noteworthy that it comes to us via the route of the Committee on Petitions, and it is to the credit of that committee that it manages to bring together opinions from across the spectrum of this House, through hearings and this report, to try to get a synthesised view.</p>
<p class="contents">The guiding principle of my group in dealing with this report has been very much to try to adopt a European set of answers to European problems. Fundamentally, the pipeline underlines the need, if ever we needed it underlined, for a European approach to energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not appropriate that different countries do different things with different partners. We need a Community response which is underlined by the principle of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much said about the environment, and the Commissioner has given some good answers to do with European environmental law, international legal obligations, but we need to build confidence here; we need to ensure, as far as possible, that European standards are adhered to and that there is a coordinated, coherent European approach to the environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Then of course we come to the very difficult subject of EU-Russia relations. We have a golden opportunity here: in the Baltic Sea area, in the High North, we have the Northern Dimension Partnership. Let us use that vehicle, which has been one of the success stories of EU-Russia relations, to help us here.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I leave you with this positive thought. In my own constituency of Yorkshire there is a small village that is now linked with a small village in Norway by the largest undersea gas pipeline across and through the North Sea. That has built people-to-people relationships that will last for a very long time. That is positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here we are certainly dealing with a petition by European citizens, representing thousands of people concerned about the construction of a gas pipeline to link up Russia and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there must be a certain amount of doubt as to the bilateral nature of the agreement between Russia and Germany, involving firms such as <span class="italic">Gazprom</span> and <span class="italic">E.ON</span>, to build one of the world’s longest pipelines. The intention is to build the pipeline in the middle of the Baltic Sea so it does not have to go through Poland and the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, this project is a political bypass, and yes, it is a bypass that not only gets round any of the potential political problems involved with building it on land, but it also shows utter contempt for the EU’s common energy policy and weakens its position in terms of relations with Russia. The bilateral energy agreements with Russia with hardly any EU coordination are also bad news for a solid EU foreign policy with a single voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The project intends to cross a fragile sea already polluted by toxic products, with an extremely limited natural water replacement rate. The consequences of any accidents would be catastrophic for all border states. Above all, we must insist on decisive application of the precautionary principle, together with an exhaustive environmental assessment to examine all the alternatives, and strict compliance with all international regulations.</p>

There is a risk of disturbance to the biological balance. What could happen with all the mines dumped on the seabed? The projected pipeline – if it is completed according to plan – means a major departure from the commitment to which lip-service is so often paid in climate discussions. However, all that talk on the climate issue needs to be taken seriously and translated into concrete action and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Every undertaking to lock up billions in natural gas investment delays much-needed investment in renewable alternative energy and goes against all the declared intentions to rethink policy on the environment and to halt climate change. The Baltic Sea and the climate issue must be brought into focus, which is why we demand that Nord Stream examine an alternative route over land before any decision is taken on a possible future gas pipeline – this is entirely consistent with the decision of the Swedish Government in February this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the matter of the gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea is one of the most contentious issues for the common energy policy that is being developed. Many people are worried that the creation of the pipeline will increase not security of supply for the continent but our defencelessness against Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot know whether prices will be more affordable for consumers, or whether they will rocket as a result of the enormous investments. And finally there is no clear answer to the questions on the current agenda: what will be the environmental consequences of the Nord Stream project?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is crucial that an appropriate impact assessment precede the sinking of the planned pipelines that will determine Europe’s energy supply for decades, including the Nord Stream. Naturally, everything must be covered by the environmental impact assessment. In our case, unfortunately, there is not a thorough, impartial assessment that takes the environmental perspectives into account.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report before us sheds much light on the environmental concerns arising in relation to the pipeline in the Baltic Sea. I feel it is wrong that there has not been a detailed analysis of the precise environmental impact that dredging up 1 200 km of the seabed may have. The dangers concealed by the unexploded munitions from the Second World War that can be found in the area have not been clarified either. The fact that hazardous chemical substances would enter the sea during the laying of the pipeline also adds to the concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">These are such important matters that I feel it is inconceivable to bring the project to fruition responsibly without responding to them clearly and reassuringly. I feel that protecting the environment and security of energy supplies are not mutually exclusive. If the European Parliament really wants to become an institution that is close to its citizens, it must take into account the 30 000 signatures on different petitions which draw attention to the environmental risks of the gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, and a real answer must be given to the questions that have been raised.

<p class="contents">The second good thing is that the debate should also have made it clear to the owners of Nord Stream and the Russian state that permission to build the gas pipeline can only be obtained if Russia also ratifies the Espoo Convention. It is a prerequisite that liability in the event of damage should have been settled. However, as we have heard, other confidence-building measures will also be needed if this project is to become the strong uniting bond between the EU and Russia that we hope.

We have the Espoo Convention, which means that the countries through whose territory the pipeline is to run are responsible for checking whether the construction work can be carried out there or not. I have trust in these countries and I am confident that this Convention will be observed, and only then can we debate whether there is some alternative version that will go this way or that way.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are now doing sometimes appears to me to be very much like a case of political partiality. Because we have political influence we absolutely have to lay the pipeline there. This means getting around the environmental impact assessment. Please let the countries and their authorities decide whether the environmental imperatives are being properly met or not.

They are worried because the environment in the sensitive Baltic sea area is at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has, however, become hugely politicised. Everyone agrees that we have to respect all of the international and environmental conventions, certainly when it comes to the sensitive Baltic Sea area. Mr President, the politicisation that is happening here has nothing to do with that. We have to admit that we need the energy, that domestic production, in the Netherlands as elsewhere, is continuing to fall and so we need the gas from other sources. That gas comes from Russia. It would have been much better to transport that gas over land but that has been made impossible. Now we have to go through that sensitive area. My first point, therefore, concerns respect for all international and environmental conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point – and I hope that not everyone has been deaf to this – is that a satisfactory environmental impact report has to lead to the issuing of permits. These permits would have to be issued by Germany, by Denmark, by Sweden and also by Finland. We will have to pass judgment on this later on another occasion, at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is that we also need a certain degree of reciprocity. We are dependent on Russian gas and the Russians are dependent on our willingness to purchase it. I hope that this reciprocity will soon be properly regulated in the partnership agreement, without all the political emotions triggered by this project. Then we will be able to resolve a great many problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, therefore, that all coastal states should jointly monitor environmental safety, and that Nord Stream must pay compensation for any damage that may occur in connection with the laying of the pipeline. However, the environmental problem is not the only issue with Nord Stream. There is also the lack of trust between Russia and the countries of the Baltic Sea region. Russia has been known to use energy policy as a political tool more than once. In addition, many of the countries of the Baltic Sea region see Nord Stream as a clear attempt by Russia to bypass them and enter the Western European market directly. Moreover, Nord Stream can be perceived as an example of a bilateral agreement between Russia and an EU Member State. Therefore, Europe has a special and fundamental interest in Nord Stream since, when energy supply is at issue, it is important that the EU be united in a common energy policy and that individual Member States do not conclude bilateral agreements. That being the case, it is important that Russia show goodwill and become a party to all international agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has raised justified concerns about energy security issues in several countries around the Baltic Sea. It has become a classic example of the principle of European solidarity gone wrong. There can surely be no doubts regarding the geopolitical importance to Russia of the Nord Stream project.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not these issues we are debating today. Today we are discussing another very important aspect of Nord Stream’s pipeline: its environmental impact. I was, therefore, very surprised that Commissioner Dimas first stressed the importance of the energy supply and business aspects of the project, only later referring to the environmental impact. I would have expected a different set of priorities from the Commissioner for the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that the Baltic Sea is a unique and fragile environmental environment. Numerous experts share the concerns of petitioners and are rightly suspicious of an environmental impact report penned by Nord Stream’s experts. Please note that the very countries around the Baltic Sea which feel the non-environmental threats of the pipeline most keenly will also suffer any environmental damage directly. Adoption of amendments that play down the environmental threats will, frankly speaking, add insult to injury. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the scale of the extensive works on the vast area of the Baltic Sea constitutes a serious danger to the natural environment, to biodiversity and habitats, to the safety and movement of shipping, and, if there were to be an ecological disaster, also to the health of the populations of the countries that lie on the Baltic Sea.</p>

He prepared this report under exceptionally difficult circumstances, as he had to face unusually powerful lobbying from the representatives of the consortium responsible for constructing this controversial project. I hope that the final version of this report will show that the times when lobbying groups had a significant influence on the laws passed by the European Union is a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, considering the merits of the case, I would like to emphasise that, in examining projects that directly affect its members, the European Union should apply objective environmental protection standards. Today’s report is a test of that objectivity. The Nord Stream project will, as we all well know, have a disastrous impact on the natural environment of the Baltic Sea. We cannot allow such a dangerous investment to take place within the European Union without the agreement of a quarter of its inhabitants. Our objective should be to reach a consensus, not to have an environmentally dangerous and economically questionable project forced through by a giant power company.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern gas pipeline is uneconomical: it is over 30 times more expensive than construction over land. According to the latest estimates, the project will cost between EUR 10 billion and EUR 20 billion. An alternative land pipeline would cost about EUR 3 billion. This means that the gas sent will have to cost much more, which will bring about an immediate rise in the cost of gas imports for the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point of this unusually controversial project is the European Union’s energy security. The Nord Stream construction project will have a drastic impact on this security. In response to Russia’s actions, the European Union should expand Member States’ access to gas and oil resources in Central Asia instead of making us even more dependent on gas supplies from Gazprom, as is happening at present. The Kremlin’s activities are aimed at preventing diversification of gas supplies in Europe and Nord Stream provides the perfect way to fulfil this objective. As I have said earlier, this is a project with absolutely no economic justification.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nord Stream project demonstrates the Kremlin’s capability to monopolise the market for gas in Europe. At the same time, the problems with the European Nabucco project provide an example of the Union’s failure to guarantee its own energy security. At this point the question arises: why is it that Germany, a country that not so long ago was a fervent supporter of freedom and security in the former Eastern Bloc countries, is now putting these countries at risk of another loss of sovereignty? By supporting the plans of the Kremlin, which is aimed at overall energy domination in Western Europe, Germany is putting these countries at risk of Russian political blackmail.</p>
<p class="contents">I am calling on all parliamentary groups to support today’s report so as to avert an enormous ecological disaster and to respect the right of all countries lying on the Baltic to give or withdraw their agreement to this type of investment. What the European Union needs at this time is solidarity in all aspects, both as regards energy security and as regards environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw your attention to three issues in this debate. In practice, all the countries bordering the Baltic Sea have serious reservations concerning this project and believe there will be a negative impact on the natural environment of the Baltic Sea. The second is the cost of this project, which, even according to the investor, is rising dramatically: initially it was estimated at EUR 4.5 billion, now it stands at around EUR 8-12 billion. You could say that this only affects the principal, but the point is that in the end the cost will be passed on to consumers. This is even more surprising as there are alternative, land routes for the gas pipeline that are two or three times cheaper. Thirdly and finally, this is a project that strikes at the heart of the ideal of a common energy policy for the European Union. It is difficult to imagine this ideal being realised in the future, when the gas pipeline project (...)</p>

It is environmentally wrong: billions are being invested in fossil fuel instead of renewable energy, and it will be environmentally destructive and give rise to enormous quantities of sludge. When the 10-km-long Öresund Bridge was built, much more toxic sludge was carted away than had been expected. This pipeline is over 1 000 km long. It will be an environmental disaster, with PCBs, DDT and chemical pesticides on the seabed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is founded on selfishness instead of solidarity. Germany and Russia are acting over the heads of other countries, which will not be offered any gas, and that too is dreadful. Even worse: it is undemocratic. It is being laid in the sea in order to prevent landowners from blocking the pipeline. It is being laid in the sea because perhaps only a few governments can say ‘no’ where it passes through their territorial waters. It is you, Commissioner, who have the right according to the Espoo Convention to defend the non-territorial part of the Baltic. It is you, only you, who can stand up for the rights of the landowners under the Espoo Convention and demand alternative routes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason the Nord Stream project strengthens Russia’s position economically and is harmful for Europe. We all know that Russia has no intention of stopping using energy as a tool for exerting political pressure. Today this is principally affecting Ukraine. Realisation of the Nord Stream project will mean that every European Union country will be similarly exposed to this type of pressure and could thus be blackmailed. We shall wait for the negative assessments of the Baltic countries to be taken into account in this matter. Commissioner Dimas can ignore these views. We may even finance this project from European funds. In that case please do not be surprised if more groups of European citizens turn their backs on the process of integration.

It is true that I have referred to the public hearing requested by the Committee on Petitions in January, in which both I and my colleague, Mr Piebalgs, Commissioner responsible for energy matters, spoke, and I have repeated what was said regarding the need for natural gas imports, as my colleague Mr Piebalgs said. I have also referred to Decision No 1364/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, pursuant to which the guidelines specified certain priority projects as projects of a European interest, including this project. That was your decision, not mine! Therefore, do not criticise me for placing too much emphasis on economic matters! I have referred precisely to matters decided by you. Other than that, the emphasis in my speech was placed on environmental matters. These are the matters I am concerned about. Therefore, I kindly ask you to be a bit more attentive, not only during one-sixth of my speech, but also during the remaining five-sixths.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns regarding the environmental impact of projects of such large proportions, of great importance and with complex technical aspects are, of course, totally legitimate. They imply that the general public is becoming increasingly involved in debates on sustainable development and on environmental protection in relation to large infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the environmental impact and the views of the public and of authorities with responsibility for environmental matters are, however, included in the environmental impact assessment, which is provided for in the relevant legislation on environmental impact assessments, in the EU directive and in the Espoo Convention, which, as I mentioned earlier, Russia has signed but not ratified, although it has stated that it will implement it. I hope it will ratify it. We always put pressure on third-party countries to ratify agreements of environmental interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings of the environmental impact procedures must be carefully evaluated by the authorities with the power to issue an implementation permit or construction permits for any kind of infrastructure project. Only then can these authorities have a clear understanding of the environmental issues included in the report so meticulously drafted by Mr Libicki.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, the report mentions the threat of large-scale pollution from the discharge into the Baltic Sea of thousands of tonnes of chemicals needed to clean the pipeline before it enters into service; ‘specific chemicals’, as the report says.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it seems that in February 2008 the contractor confirmed that it does not intend using these chemicals in the pipeline’s pressure tests before it enters into service. This does not mean that the problem will not be there. It is highly probable that other chemicals will be used. Nonetheless, it means that we must wait until the environmental impact assessment procedure has been concluded, as is required by the law, in order to be able to discuss compliance with EU legislation and policy, the impact, the risks, the measures and also to decide on the terms which must be imposed on the project owner.</p>
<p class="contents">The transparency terms set for the environmental impact assessment procedure ensure that all the parties involved, including the European Parliament, will have access to all the relevant information.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, various sides have today voiced the view that the Commission must have great jurisdiction, either in order to carry out environmental impact studies or in order to impose various policies. The Commission’s jurisdiction is specific; with regard to studies and environmental assessment studies, it has neither the means nor the jurisdiction, with the latter held by the Member States. The role of the Commission, as stated in the Treaty, is to ensure that the Member States duly implement and fully adhere to all the rules of Community law, including the international agreements ratified by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may only intervene if there are serious grounds to believe that there have been omissions in performing the relevant legal obligations based on Community law, including the environmental laws of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been no such indications so far, as the environmental impact study procedure is still in progress. I assure you that the Commission will not hesitate to intervene if and when needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can simply repeat at this point that the Commission expects the Member States to fully honour their obligations stemming from Community law. This is a fundamental condition for any final decision of approval.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you once again and to thank Mr Libicki for his report and for the opportunity he gave us to discuss this crucial issue of the pipeline and of its potential environmental impact.</p>

I have to say that I feel proud to be a Member of this House. Today, this House spoke with the voice of the people, which is not always the case in Parliament: the voice of the people, as in the best European traditions of the European Parliaments, which were established so that the people’s views could be put to the great and good of this world.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Dimas, today you are one of the great and good of this world. Please listen to the voice of the people, who spoke today through these parliamentarians. Nearly everyone agreed that this pipeline is not just a threat to the environment, but that it will be harmful to the environment, firstly through the construction process and then, God forbid, should any disaster occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Many opinions were put forward on this subject, but Mr Dimas did not discuss them. Why not build the gas pipeline overland when it would be three times cheaper and would also be safer? The European Commission has nothing to say yet this is an issue that was discussed. Another issue was raised: the fact that Nord Stream is a State-owned company, that it is all part of a political plan. There were comments to the effect that this is all politics. Yes, it is all politics: the politics of Nord Stream and its owner, the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also talk in the House that what is needed is European solidarity. I do not understand why the amendment was tabled to cancel the clause discussing solidarity. It is exactly this issue that is a test of European solidarity, as was mentioned just a moment ago. Why have you not spoken of the costs that will be passed on to consumers? This was raised here. Now we are facing this test: will the great and good of this world, the great and good of the Union, to which you belong, Commissioner, listen to the voice of the people, as the great and the good listened to the voice of parliament in ages past?

Over 30 000 worried EU citizens have asked for assistance with regard to the proposal to construct a pipeline on the Baltic seabed. It is a great shame that those who intend to undertake this investment have not as yet submitted an environmental impact assessment. After all, this is to be the longest undersea construction project in the world at 1 200 kilometres. The issue we are debating today has both an ecological and an economic dimension. Of course, one cannot ignore the political background to the whole issue. The route of the pipeline is to go through Natura 2000 areas as well as underwater ammunition dumps and sunken poisonous gas from the time of the Second World War. We must, therefore, have some reliable research carried out, looking at the risks in four scenarios: during the construction of the pipeline, during normal use, in critical situations (disaster) and when the pipeline is being dismantled after use or if the supply contract is terminated. We have no reliable analysis of this project, at a time when, according to the law, just about every building project requires an environmental impact assessment. This is not just an issue affecting two countries: Germany and Russia. Today, this issue is also an example of a lack of European solidarity in the field of energy. Let us therefore listen to the voices of our concerned citizens. They can tell that there is something here that is wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report addresses creditably the concerns of Union’s citizens – especially citizens of the states surrounding the Baltic – about the environmental impact of the planned gas pipeline. The construction of the Baltic gas pipeline is primarily an environmental question, and the whole project and its feasibility should be examined in this light.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic is one of the most polluted seas in the world. Its special character makes it a particularly vulnerable sea: it is one of the shallowest seas in the world and its water turnover is slow. The Baltic is a unique body of brackish water, and for this reason some of the plants and animals in the sea are not found anywhere else in the world. Massive environmental damage would be catastrophic for the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the requirement in the report for an independent third party to conduct an environmental impact analysis. The analysis should be based on extensive scientific and environmental factors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also possible even to get Russia to commit to the implementation of any negative decisions from the environmental assessments, by way of internationally agreed conventions. All the conventions mentioned in the report are relevant. It is noteworthy that this would be the first time that the Helsinki Treaty of 1974 were to be applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction work must not start before all the possible environmental effects connected with the life cycle of the pipeline have been assessed. Routing the pipeline by land should also be considered carefully. The energy needs of the Union are undisputed. However, there are many ways of satisfying energy needs, and the seas inside the Union should not be decisively endangered only because other options would seem to be more expensive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Their petition resulted in a public hearing and in a European Parliament report, which highlighted the need to include other countries, and the EU in particular, in the decision-making process. The problems are due to the ecological risks that exist as a result of vast graveyards of warships and munitions at the bottom of the sea, and a risky chemical method needed to clean the pipeline before it enters into service.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not express an opinion on the land-based alternative route but I firmly believe that the European Commission and the Council must take up their role as coordinators duties and consistently demand – in the interest of the Baltic and other countries – that the investors assume full responsibility for potential ecological damage. The Commission and the Council must also request an independent impact assessment and an assessment of the alternative land-based route.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern gas supply route from Russia is important. Therefore, it is imperative that the EU signs an agreement with Russia regarding the conditions for monitoring the construction of the gas pipeline and for its safe operation. After all, Russia has not yet ratified the Espoo Convention. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a common EU energy policy or standards. We can clearly see that instead of a bilateral agreement between Germany and Russia, Europeans need an EU agreement and the consent of the Baltic countries to the construction.

The planned Baltic pipeline will undoubtedly have an impact on the environment, and this must be investigated. It must be done in order to minimise the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Nord Stream does not fall within the EU’s powers, and even Parliament is only debating the matter on the basis of a report by the Committee on Petitions. It is Polish internal politics, which is being brought before a Community institution in this roundabout way as an environmental issue, without any reference to the political motives of Poland and the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">If I were a Russian gas salesman and a German buyer, I would not be able to rely on the security of supply, especially in the event that the gas pipeline is routed through Polish territory. In Europe we have bad experiences of Ukraine’s mediation, when it stockpiled gas or failed to pay for it and then, when it came to the crunch, it kept for its own use gas that had been sent from Russia to Central Europe. The same kind of danger has not been ruled out in the case of Poland. So logically it works against the development of trade and economic relations between Russia and the EU. And the countries of the Baltic support it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">André Brie, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Jouyet, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday in Kabul saw the bloodiest attack since 2001 with more than 40 Afghans and Indians killed and 140 injured. We wish to extend our deepest sympathy to the victims and express our outrage at the murderers who were responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who follow the European media and those who, for example, have read today’s edition of <span class="italic">Daily Outlook Afghanistan</span> will know that violence in Afghanistan has now become much more widespread and commonplace. Teachers are being shot practically every day, which is one of the most cynical aspects of the Taliban strategy. Schools, and especially girls’ schools, are being burnt down or forced to close, bridges and roads are being blown up. What was not reported in Europe was the attack by the US-led coalition forces on a wedding party in the province of Nangarhar on Sunday that left 23 people dead, including the bride. A similar incident also occurred in the neighbouring province of Urusgan. President Karsai has now ordered an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated in the last three years. However, there are many distinctly positive developments to be considered too: advances in education and health policy, regional success in the rebuilding programme and in the eradication of drugs, the creation of a critical and independent media thanks to a number of incredibly courageous journalists, and the establishment in many areas of an active civil society along with spirited women’s organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also negative aspects to report, such as the fact that the growing of opium poppies has now reached record levels nationwide and that this crop has become increasingly linked to the general economy as well as to the escalating levels of crime and corruption and to the activities of the insurgent groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The international food crisis has had dramatic consequences for millions of Afghans. Corruption is widespread in government circles and indeed originates from this source. The rule of law is not properly established and can be compared with Guantanamo or the US prison in Bagram, as well as being fundamentally questioned by international governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentalist ideologies have clearly been gaining ground in recent years, even in key areas of government and parliament, and this poses a threat to the freedom of the press and media and, more particularly, to the hopes of Afghan women and girls for an equal role in society.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrible violence being committed every day against women and girls on a domestic, family and local level is for me still the most serious and glaring problem and one that is most being ignored by our media. It pains me that due to lack of time I am unable to go into this in any more detail. Afghanistan and its people have deserved our fullest commitment. After 30 years of war, with more than one and a half million people killed, the international community is duty-bound to show its full solidarity with Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The country and its society have been destroyed by the policies and war of occupation waged by the Soviet Union, by the internal warfare of the Mujahedeen groups who were armed by the US, Pakistan, Iran and other countries, and by the sinister rule of the Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report presents a discriminating and realistic picture. It recognises the significant successes of the Afghan people and identifies the political shortcomings of the Afghan and other international governments. It expresses our fullest support and makes clear that we are absolutely committed to establishing democracy and human rights, especially the rights of Afghan women and children. This is not only a matter of general principle but also a specific requirement as far as Malalai Dschoja, Pervez Kambasch and Latif Petram are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report the European Parliament is calling for a new strategy for the international community and for the Afghan Government that has as its central focus the rebuilding of civil society. This is the policy being promoted by the UN Special Representative for Afghanistan, Kai Eide. This is a most important move and I am pleased that we in this House have sent out such a signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my thanks to my colleagues from the other political groups, to the Commission – and Commissioner you have a wonderful team in Kabul and in Brussels dealing with the Afghanistan problem – and to the Council’s Special Representative, as well as to the many Afghan and international NGOs that have been involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore say that this makes it all the more difficult for me to have to withdraw my name from the report. I was unable to persuade a majority that the problems of Afghanistan cannot be solved by military means. If a majority in this House should now then call for troop levels to be strengthened and in so doing ignore the national reservations of the Member States, this would defeat the real issues raised in the report and would run counter to my own personal concerns. The fact that the majority wishes of all the peoples of Europe should be disregarded is unacceptable for Afghanistan – the events of recent days bear this out – and is absolutely the wrong policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before beginning, like Mr Brie, I, too, wish to strongly condemn, on behalf of the Presidency, yesterday’s attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul, which killed more than 40 civilians, including a number of embassy personnel, and injured hundreds. This attack sought to destabilise the consolidation and reconstruction process under way in Afghanistan. The European Union is fully determined to support the Afghan Government and the Afghan people in their efforts to build a stable and democratic state, and these tragic events highlight the importance and urgency of our discussions this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, the Council is convinced of the need for a long-term commitment in Afghanistan. Our objective must be to help the government to develop the structures needed for a modern and democratic state that can function properly, guarantee the safety of its citizens, respect the rule of law, and promote economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that the combined effort of the Afghan authorities and the international community has produced some impressive results that should be highlighted: 25% decline in the infant mortality rate and 6 million children attending school, a third of whom are girls. In this respect, I must pay tribute to the work carried out by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and by the Commission in general in this area and in all aspects relating to the restoration of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must build on these successes, but we must be aware, too, of the extent of the challenges that lie ahead, especially those highlighted by Mr Brie: governance, insecurity, corruption and drugs, which go hand in hand and have a negative impact on the normal functioning of the institutions and the sustainable development of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore work with our other partners in the drugs field to ensure the application of Security Council Resolution 1817, adopted on 11 June, which should enable the international community to step up the fight against trafficking in the precursor chemicals used to produce heroin.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, the Council places the utmost importance on the democratic process in Afghanistan. During the 2004 and 2005 elections the Afghan people opted very clearly and very determinedly for democracy and stability, and we must help them to establish the best possible conditions for the preparations for the forthcoming presidential election in 2009 and general election in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was extremely interested in the report on Afghanistan presented by Parliament and summarised by Mr Brie, and wishes to highlight three specific aspects. The first is that the Council hopes that the Afghan Government will assume a greater share of the responsibility for Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development process. Moreover, in all areas emphasis should be placed on the Afghan people assuming their responsibilities and the need for guarantees in the area of good governance, hence the obligation on the Afghan authorities to fulfil their commitments in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council underlines the importance of moving forward in close cooperation with the Afghan Government towards a single vision within the international community of how to achieve common objectives, ensuring in particular that the actions carried out are coherent in terms of their military and civil dimensions. That is the mandate given to the new United Nations Special Representative, Mr Kai Eide, and the Council wishes to express its full support for him in his mission. It is in the same context that the Council feels that it is necessary to strengthen the capacities of UNAMA (United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan) in order to extend its presence throughout the territory, notably in the south and west of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third and final observation concerning Mr Brie’s report is that it is essential to improve cooperation and relations between Afghanistan and its neighbours in order to ensure permanent stability in the country, especially given the multi-dimensional nature of some of the problems clearly highlighted by Mr Brie, notably drug production and trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, these brief comments on the report presented by Parliament should not take away from the fact that in general the Council and Parliament have very similar views on the policy to be implemented in Afghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome and encourage the initiative presented in Mr Brie’s report aimed at strengthening the cooperation between the European Parliament and the Afghan Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons the Union will continue to act and play a major role in mobilising the international community to assist Afghanistan. That goal formed the basis of the Council conclusions of 26 May, which were largely inspired by the worked carried out at the International Conference in support of Afghanistan held in Paris on 12 June. This Conference was a great success for Afghanistan, as it was for the European Union, which succeeded in putting across in full its positions on key aspects of the country’s development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should point out that a few months earlier, at the NATO Summit held in Bucharest from 2 to 4 April, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, together with President Karzai and the UN Secretary-General, attended the meeting of Heads of State and Government on Afghanistan. The countries contributing to the IFAS, for which the EU Member States provide almost half of the personnel, adopted in Bucharest a new strategy for their common commitment guided by four principles, which I will mention here: a firm and shared long-term commitment; support for enhanced Afghan leadership and responsibility in security matters; a comprehensive approach by the international community to reconstruction; and a shared political strategy involving Afghanistan’s neighbours, especially Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to highlight certain areas where the European Union makes a significant contribution and where its action is essential for strengthening State capacities and consolidating the rule of law in Afghanistan. First of all, as you know, the Union has had a Special Representative since 2002 and that post is currently held by Mr Francesc Vendrell. The difficulties initially encountered when setting up the EUPOL mission, which were logistical in nature, have now been resolved. EUPOL is particularly involved in the reform of the Ministry of the Interior and in the development of a strategy for the Afghan police.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wanted to point out that by deciding at the last General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 May that its goal was to double the number of personnel involved in its Afghanistan police mission, the European Union sent a clear message to both its Afghan partners and the international community regarding its enhanced commitment to Afghanistan. This increase in the size of the EUPOL mission should improve the visibility and effectiveness of our action in the key sectors relating to police reform, in spite of the violent events that have taken place in recent days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also endorse the words expressed both by you and by the President-in-Office of the Council. It truly tragic that yesterday we again witnessed such a calamity as this terrorist attack. On one hand we of course have to express our clearest condemnation, but on the other there are also the victims to consider. This is precisely the setting in which this debate unfortunately has to take place. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that I think this very comprehensive report is very important in this difficult and precarious security situation and we cannot, and will not, allow those who wish to take Afghanistan backwards to prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last months, and particularly during the preparation of this report, we have been working very closely with the rapporteur. I wanted to thank you for your interest as witnessed, firstly, by the two visits the European Parliament has made there and, secondly, in November 2007, when you again received parliamentarians from the Wolesi Jirga in Brussels, which was an important sign for them. We have worked with a dedicated Delegation for relations with Afghanistan; you are following developments on the ground very closely, and we try to help where we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, your report addresses <span class="italic">the</span> central issue: how can we stabilise Afghanistan, what are the challenges facing the international community, and how can we deal with them? In the same spirit, at the important conference in Paris we said clearly that we want to overcome the threat of terrorism; but, at the same time, we also have a challenge in our public opinions everywhere, because they do not always appreciate the challenges, and do not always embrace all the efforts that it takes to combat this threat.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Paris Conference was also a very important and good opportunity to review our strategy, to focus it even more clearly. The Commission has committed EUR 1.2 billion from 2002-2007. We have particularly worked on the following: firstly, providing better security in Afghanistan by financing police salaries, closely linking this to support for Afghanistan’s police and its reform; secondly, providing alternative livelihoods to the opium poppy and thus helping to eradicate drugs; thirdly, improving the lives of Afghans – we have focused here particularly on healthcare, where we already have been part of the undeniable success of recent years, and I would also say that we have worked on the infrastructure and regional integration with transit links, such as the important road from Jalalabad to Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Paris Conference also delivered a distinct political message about overdue changes. These changes are indispensable if we want to realise mutual obligations under the Afghanistan compact and turn international efforts – all our efforts – into success on the ground. Therefore, we all know that more and better coordination is needed among all the actors involved. I can also praise Mr Kai Eide, whom I have known for many years, who is an excellent person. He will play a central role and I can assure you we will all work with him very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">But, of course, we also see the necessity for a genuine commitment by our Afghan partners. They really have to go for more ownership in their state-building process, and this comes, of course, with its own responsibility and with a vision for a stable country for the future. We are heading towards the elections in 2009 and 2010; undoubtedly for the Government it will be crucial to regain legitimacy, which has been dented by corruption and weak governance, notably in the provinces, and therefore we are looking into ways of how to best support the election process.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan is at a crossroads. Many of the early achievements of democratic state-building – notably human rights, freedom of expression and the media – are somewhat under pressure. It will be hard under such circumstances for a civil society to emerge. In this context, your commitment here in Parliament – and I thank the rapporteur once again – and your cooperation with the Afghan Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, are invaluable. I think you can contribute to this fostering of a democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">As the EU – and I close with that – we have the responsibility to support Afghanistan in the interest not only of the people of that country and of the stability of the whole region but also of Europe. This is what we also have to clearly tell our taxpayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank Mr Brie for the commitment and enthusiasm he has invested in this report, and would appeal to him not to withdraw his name from it because he did a very good job of work, along with the other shadow rapporteurs and myself. To say what? To do what, at such a crucial moment for Afghanistan? What happened yesterday demonstrates that the commitment of Europe and others to Afghanistan is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">What we demand in this report is, firstly, a stronger commitment in terms of military presence, because without that we shall get nowhere; secondly, a stepping-up of the commitment to improve democratic structures in the new Republic of Afghanistan, which has fallen into a situation of total lawlessness over the past 30 or more years and, worst of all, lies at the heart of international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">When we began to turn our attention to the phenomenon of international terrorism after September 11<span class="sup">th</span>, we went into Afghanistan and then Iraq and found that we had entered a viper’s nest. The last outpost – like Hitler in his Berlin bunker, as it were – of terrorists in the world at the moment is Afghanistan. They are trying to regroup, taking revenge in Afghanistan for the defeat they have suffered and are still suffering in Iraq.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, during the vote in committee, two important ideas contained within the compromise amendments fell victim to the political prejudice of colleagues who prefer to ignore the problems facing the international community in Afghanistan, problems horrifically illustrated by yesterday’s suicide attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul. As a result, the reference to the need for the international community to reassess its civil and military strategy fell by the wayside, as did the passage underlining the growing popular discontent at the corruption spreading through government institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I call on my fellow Members to support the amendments reintroduced by the PSE Group in order to rebalance the report. How can a report of this House on Afghanistan refrain from mentioning the role of Pakistan and its military regime that for so many years has misgoverned that country? How can we, as Members of the European Parliament, ignore the secret prisons of our US allies in Kabul and not only that? Why do some Members reject legitimate criticisms of the Afghan judicial system? The position of the PSE Group is clear: it is possible to support the increased presence of international troops in Afghanistan while, at the same time, defending the need to reassess the military strategy of the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force). It is possible to be in favour of close cooperation between Europe and the United States in Afghanistan, without closing our eyes to the crimes committed by the Bush Administration in the name of the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is possible to support the Afghan institutions while, at the same time, drawing attention to their severe limitations. Europe will only be able to assume a strategic role in Afghanistan when it stops being afraid of presenting its own vision for the future of the country. Why not start here and now with this report? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has dealt with this difficult topic thoroughly and from various angles.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary challenges for Afghanistan are restoring security and establishing a functioning state. It is a difficult task, because the security situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated rather than improved. Improving the security situation is an essential requirement for all development, but a military solution alone will not remove the complex problems of the country, as the rapporteur stated.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconstructing the entire society, implementing the rule of law, improving democracy and human rights, promoting equality and building a functioning government, educational institutions and healthcare for the whole country are enormous tasks. Afghanistan also needs a programme for the comprehensive development of rural areas and the creation of alternatives for opium farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">All this also requires greater contributions by the European Union to supporting and reconstructing Afghanistan. The EU must also strive to make the activities of the international community more effective by coordinating them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would still like to emphasise the significance of the civil society that is developing in Afghanistan for strengthening the rule of law and democracy and for defeating the culture of violence. The development and freedom to act of independent, pluralistic means of communication are extremely important in this work. There is still a lot of work to do in this area in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason Operation Enduring Freedom, which was begun by the US, the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic, France and Romania, together with the present ISAF mission, which brings together a military coalition of almost all the Member States in the European Union, should be treated as a success. The education system is working better, the healthcare system is working better and the Government of Mr Hamid Karzai is in control of a significant part of the country under very difficult circumstances. The terrorist revival in 2007 can only mean one thing for us: what Afghanistan needs from the European Union and NATO is increased financial, political and military support. A different approach, which can be seen in the amendments put forward by the left, would be a demonstration of selfishness, hypocrisy and short-sightedness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Group will recommend that everyone reads the original report produced by Mr Brie so that they will understand the nature of the challenges facing us in Afghanistan. What then happened was that a majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs simply amended and deleted the measures that were so urgently needed. We simply cannot say: more troops, everything to continue as before, everything is going well. Nothing is going well! Yesterday’s attack showed that. We need to revise the military strategy; we need to bring all the different initiatives together. This was actually what we wanted to achieve together.</p>
<p class="contents">My group tabled the amendments in conjunction with the Socialist Group in order to fight now to achieve this important objective, Mr Brie. I say this with all the respect that I have had for the work that you have done in recent years: we are arguing here about what is the right position to take and it is cowardly on your part – just because your Group has stabbed you in the back, and all over a subtly different position that also states that we need troops, but we need to do it properly – to simply duck your head and say that you are withdrawing your name. This is not helping the Afghan people, neither is it helping this Parliament to develop a coherent strategy for Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on everyone to vote for the amendments, then we will be fulfilling our responsibilities: our responsibilities to those we are sending over there, the policemen and the soldiers, and to those we want to help, namely the people of Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this attack will not deter India, an important ally in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, from continuing its assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a greater tragedy in Afghanistan than the destruction of the buildings, and this is the destruction of human life and individuals over the last 35 years. It will take a greater effort than we can imagine and a longer time to reconstruct and help rebuild those lives in such a shattered country.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing, however, which Afghanistan needs is more security, not less security. I welcome the fact that the report reflects a consensus, which also exists on the ground in Afghanistan, that a political solution is only possible if we sustain the military pressure on the Taliban and the insurgency. We have to sustain that pressure if we are to ensure a political solution to the situation. We have to support the policy of the Afghanistan Government that talks with Taliban elements are possible only with those who accept the constitution and put their weapons down. They can return to the political process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to support Mr Karzai and the Afghanistan Government in retaking control of their country and in retaking control of the policy initiatives in their own country. Therefore I welcome very much what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said about focusing on the elections next year. Afghanistan needs a strong government, a committed government that looks forward and does not look backwards towards its past.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me again say that I believe that the Commission is making an excellent effort in organising our assistance programmes in Afghanistan. In particular the Ambassador, Mr Kretschmer, and of course the Special Representative, Mr Vendrell, are doing an excellent job representing the European Union. We need today to send a strong signal of support to our people in Afghanistan, to our services and to the Council to continue their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The military pressure on the insurgents must be matched by an intensive political process, and by a dialogue with all segments of the population that recognise the Constitution and are willing to lay down their weapons. I am of the opinion that the European Union should play an increasing role in supporting Afghanistan in building its own state, with stronger democratic institutions capable of ensuring territorial integrity, state unity, and economic and social development. At present, support is urgently needed for the south of the country in particular. Strengthening of administrative institutions and a gradual takeover of the responsibilities for running the country by Afghan authorities must, however, be accompanied by effective human rights protection for all, under the rule of law.

<p class="contents">Our discussion has highlighted the fact that we are dealing with a very complex situation, which requires more than just a military solution; that we are facing an extremely difficult situation; that the international community needs to make a long-term commitment, which is necessary and a critical element for the European Union, as you said; that it will take a long time to raise the people’s hopes; and that when it comes to governance in particular, as the Commission pointed out, we must concentrate on the preparations for the forthcoming elections. For its part, the Council is of course going to continue to monitor the election preparations very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the governance-related aspects, respect for the rule of law and for everything related to our traditions is not a dividing element; we must also tell the Afghan authorities this.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the security rules and presence on the ground, I should point out that EU personnel account for more than 50% of the IFAS and the Council will concentrate on four priority areas over the coming months. The first priority will be to implement the substantial increase in EUPOL personnel decided on at the Council of 26 May. Clearly, all aspects relating to police effectiveness are important and Parliament is right to be concerned about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council will endeavour to monitor the implementation of the conclusions of the International Conference in support of Afghanistan: the European Union must play a key role in this respect given its financial contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union must stress the need to improve relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan – as several of you mentioned – and to encourage both countries to continue to work actively to strengthen their cooperation, notably in the fight against the common challenge posed by terrorism and in all matters relating to drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is important for the Council and the Commission to have the European Parliament’s full support in this matter, which is critical for the international community and – as several of you also highlighted – for the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will just make three remarks. The first is on Pakistan. It is absolutely clear that it is very important to work on the border area also, and I think also to exploit this window of opportunity that is there following the new formation of the government in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">But at the same time we already see rising tensions there, and hopefully these will not, of course, jeopardise the somewhat improved bilateral exchanges at grass-root level.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working, therefore, in the border areas and we see that regional cooperation, including border management and regional trade facilities, is important, and we also support the G8 dialogue initiative that has been started with Germany on Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is my first remark.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is on justice. Indeed, we think that good governance is of course important and this goes hand-in-hand with police and justice. If there is impunity the police can do what they want. There has to be a good system of justice. Therefore, together with the Council, which has been working on police, we the Commission have been working very strongly on justice and we have, therefore, contributed substantially to shaping Afghanistan’s national justice strategy and programme and again this has to be a sustainable programme which means for the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a dedicated window, this is the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) for the justice sector to which we plan to contribute also from Afghanistan’s bilateral programme and we have delivered on the process and promise already at the Rome Conference, but of course a lot of reforms are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last remark is on rural development. The Paris Conference has clearly shown that our focus has to be very strong on rural development. I must say we have from the beginning also had this as one of the important sectors and have worked on that. We are strongly engaged in continuing and in providing economic alternatives to opium poppy production.</p>
<p class="contents">We also – and this is so to say, the news spin – improve rural infrastructures through river-basin management and irrigation and improve local seeds and animal breeding. And I personally think it is highly interesting to look into a regional approach, for instance in the north, with cooperation with Tajikistan on hydro-power for electricity and for gaining water for irrigation of fields, thus of course giving much better food production for the Afghan population, which could bring them away from drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus we are indeed looking forward to a continued close and fruitful joint cooperation with Parliament because it will be for the long haul that we are there, and I do hope we get your support for the policy as such – for the strategy, but also for the implementation. We know it is taxpayers’ money but I think we have to be there and work together with you for the stability of Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to say to Mrs Beer that I am not afraid of my own group and would be fully up for this debate. One of the most dreadful amendments to my report in committee came from my group: it stated that there had been no positive changes in Afghanistan. The arrogance of this really incenses me. I believe that we all need to take a very realistic and discriminating attitude towards Afghanistan. That country has a society that is not only rich but also contradictory and multifaceted, and the problems facing us are even more so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, many colleagues and fellow Members have said to me that we need to shoulder our responsibilities towards Afghanistan when it comes to dealing with terrorism, opium growing, corruption and so on. Many of my left-wing colleagues would possibly say that this applies to the occupation too. My own personal viewpoint, which I have tried to make clear, has to do with the interests of a people who have lived through 30 years of war. I think that much of this is in the report and for this I would again thank all those persons and all those groups involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, while I disagree with important parts of the text I am happy to continue to work on the report as part of my ongoing commitment to Afghanistan. There is no question of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a country that experiences many terrorist attacks, with worsening internal security, and where human rights are not respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The country is a producer of an enormous quantity of opium, which also has a negative impact on security and politics, as an economy based on opium production is a source of corruption, weakening public institutions, particularly the legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">Over half of the Afghan population lives below the poverty line, with unemployment reaching 40%, and renouncing Islam is still a punishable offence. Despite the fact that this country embarked on a complicated and painstaking process of reconstruction, it needs to satisfy its inhabitants’ needs much better in areas such as education, health, housing, food and public safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Help given to Afghanistan should involve short-term and long-term measures made possible by far-reaching improvements to the system of government. The support of the European Union should be based on the experience and knowledge of the missions of Member States that are present in Afghan territory, using civilian or military forces as intermediaries. The presence of NATO forces is also vital to combat terrorism. The large-scale participation of the population in elections should have a positive effect on the country’s future, as this shows a desire to create a democratic state. It is also extremely important to continue the battle against corruption and to encourage the creation of new structures in Afghan institutions. Restructuring and the joint international effort can have an enormous impact on pulling Afghanistan out of the difficult situation it is in, caused by the long-running internal conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title6"></a><a name="creitem6"></a>

<p class="contents">The international economic and political context is difficult and it made the negotiation of this text especially tricky. Several factors had to be taken into consideration: first and foremost, the rising price of oil, as well as the need to preserve the global competitiveness of European airlines, the Union’s desire and commitment to combat climate change, and the conclusion of an international agreement in Copenhagen in 2009. It was vital to take account of the interests of each party, including the interests of the regions that, as a result of their geographical situation, are extremely dependent on aviation for their development or for their links with mainland territories.</p>
<p class="contents">We also took into account the airlines in the new Member States, where the mobility rate is low at present but is growing quickly. Finally, the specific situation of small and medium-sized enterprises is also taken into consideration, with the result that the compromise before you today is a balanced yet ambitious package of measures. This compromise recognises that the aviation industry will have to contribute to the efforts to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, and at the same time it enables that sector, which is obviously very important, to prepare for, and adapt to, the new environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The proportion of allowances that may be auctioned is moderate, very moderate, and the limit used to calculate the allowances allocated to the various operators is realistic. This agreement has a global scope: it concerns European companies but also companies from third countries. On the one hand, it will have to take into account the equivalent measures that these third countries could implement and, on the other hand, it will, above all, have to be seen as the precursor to a future global agreement on the participation of international aviation activities in the carbon market. That is our ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the Commission thus wish to pursue the discussions in the various international bodies to establish the conditions for such a global agreement, or bilateral agreements, with a view to forging links between the European system and other national or regional systems in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we took care to send a specific message to the developing countries, many of whose airlines could be exempt from the scheme due to the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> clause incorporated in the text of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, in this same spirit the text indicates that the auctioning proceeds should be used to tackle the effects of climate change within Europe and outside Europe through a whole series of measures that are set out in the text. Particular emphasis was placed on the measures aimed at facilitating adaptation to climate change in developing countries, aeronautical research and low-emission forms of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am satisfied that it has been possible to reach an agreement at second reading. The MEPs have played a decisive role in safeguarding the integrity of the Commission’s proposal and in setting higher objectives for the environment on certain important points.</p>
<p class="contents">By reaching an agreement on the directive, the Community institutions have demonstrated that the European Union is able to adopt specific measures to accomplish its ambitious objectives on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is the first of a series of measures aiming to achieve the EU target on greenhouse gases for 2020. Adopting it sends a positive message for the upcoming negotiations on the package of climate and energy measures.</p>
<p class="contents">All sectors of the economy have a duty to contribute to the accomplishment of the EU climate change targets. The inclusion of the air transport sector in the emission allowance trading scheme is an indispensable element of the European Union’s overall approach in dealing with the impact of air transport on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Air transport emissions are rapidly increasing; they have almost doubled since 1990 and are expected to double once again by 2020. It is therefore necessary to take decisive action, which is feasible only at European Union level, not at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">Reaching an agreement at second reading also confirms the power of the EU emission allowance trading scheme, which is the largest one in the world. Through the international negotiations aimed at establishing an international agreement on climate after 2012, the emission trading scheme may constitute the foundations on which the global carbon dioxide market will be built.</p>
<p class="contents">Participation in the EU emission allowance trading scheme will allow airlines to gain the experience that will be required for future restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to adopting and implementing the directive, the Commission will continue its efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and with the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reach an effective global agreement designed to deal with air transport emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to press for the inclusion of air transport in an international climate change control regime after 2012, when the Kyoto targets expire.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no global agreement can be reached if no one is willing to lead this worldwide effort. By including air transport in the EU emission allowance trading scheme, we are assuming this leading role, but we are at the same time stressing that we are open to discussion with our partners, which we hope will lead to a worldwide system.</p>
<p class="contents">On certain crucial points, the European Parliament has been successful in its negotiations and, therefore, the final legislative act goes beyond the Commission’s initial proposal, especially with regard to the maximum limit and to the proportion of allowance auctioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament insisted, throughout the negotiation process, on the need to ensure an ambitious directive to deal with the impact of air transport on climate change. The agreement on this directive is an important step forward in fighting climate change. The European Commission is, therefore, able to accept the compromise package in order for an agreement to be reached at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Liese, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have in fact doubled since 1990, and possibly even more than doubled, for the most recent figures are not yet available. This does not fit in at all with the European Union’s target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, which is actually to be increased to 30% if others join in. The decision to include aviation in emission allowance trading has therefore been overdue and it is good to see that we have now reached a compromise at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is an important signal for the general climate and energy package that we still hope to conclude this year, if at all possible. I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this successful outcome, namely the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of other committees, such as Mr Jarzembowski of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the various staff members, the representatives of the Commission and the Council, and especially the Slovenian Presidency, which in my opinion delivered a master-stroke in view of the difficult discussions that were taking place at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">We had to argue and wrestle over many important issues, but at the end of the day we came up with a workable compromise containing many elements that can generally be regarded as positive. Emission allowance trading for the aviation sector will now be able to function smoothly right from the off, which was not the case for the power generation and energy-intensive industries. There will be no national allocation plans and therefore no related problems such as over-allocation, distortion of competition and such like. We shall put in place a standardised European distribution system based on benchmarks and auctioning, which means that undertakings that have already invested in clean technology will be rewarded and not in some cases penalised, as in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we persuade the Council of Ministers to agree to a formulation involving the earmarking of revenues, which goes further than anything the Council has yet been prepared to accept elsewhere. This is all to do with climate protection: we do not want to introduce any new taxes here but rather to ensure that the revenues are earmarked. It particularly appeals to me personally that we should focus support on those who use environmentally-friendly means of transport such as trains and buses, for they too are suffering from the high oil prices and, compared with the airlines, sometimes have to cope with all kinds of different taxes, which in my country also means having to pay an ecotax. We really need to think about making some changes to this and we now have an opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The revolutionary aspect is that flights and airlines from third countries are included. This is necessary for environmental reasons, for two thirds of the emissions covered by our system originate not from internal European air travel but from intercontinental flights. We also want to incorporate third countries for competition reasons. We are convinced that our regulations are compatible with international law, for example the Chicago Convention, and there is much legal opinion to bear this out.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to live with the fact that the present administration in the United States sees this differently. I am not someone who criticises President Bush in everything he does – I tend to be more discriminating – but in this case I find it really intolerable that the Government of the United States is saying that we should still be negotiating at international level, which means at ICAO level. The ICAO has been in charge of reducing aviation emissions since 1997, in other words since Kyoto, and it has so far achieved nothing, absolutely nothing, and one of the main reasons for this is the resistance that has been put up by the current American Administration.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I would like to say something once again quite clearly: we want to see an international agreement, but realistically it has to be said that we shall only achieve this when someone enters the White House, whether it be John McCain or Barack Obama, who really takes climate protection seriously. Then we will be able to make some progress here too. All in all I think that everyone has to make concessions, but this is a good compromise and I would be pleased if this House could now vote for it with a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two aspects to this: firstly there is the well-balanced and successful outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council, but secondly we also have a balanced result as far as the environmental lobby and the interests of the transport industry and commercial sector are concerned, and we can see that this is a very complex set of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that we have agreed on 2012 as the date for introducing the scheme. This gives us an opportunity to make progress in our negotiations with third countries. I would at this point make an appeal to you, Commissioner: we cannot simply take the position that we are right and everyone else should follow us, for then we shall have other countries taking retaliatory measures against our airlines. This is not on. We should not be sacrificing the airlines, and the European airports too because of the translocation effect, to a one-sided environment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also call on you to take seriously the task that the Council and Parliament have been set and to act quickly in the negotiations over the next few years. I admit that with America you can leave things until 2010, but with the other countries – such as Russia and China – we need to talk things through so that our non-integrated solution does not endanger our airlines and our airports with their many thousands and millions of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that things have been kept in balance, for we are in fact going back to the years 2004 to 2006 as the reference date for the allocation of certificates, but we have been very reasonable in setting the cap at 97% and 95% and by initially allocating 85% of the certificates free of charge, with only 15% to be put to auction. We thereby hope to achieve the intended effect of reducing the environmental burden imposed by the aviation industry. At the same time we shall be able to keep airline costs and passenger charges within reasonable bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel we have to ensure that we balance the interests of our citizens between the environment on one hand and their transport and mobility needs on the other. For this reason I would once again congratulate the rapporteur on his achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This gives me great hopes for the forthcoming energy package that we shall be producing here in this House and then in association with the Council, and all to be done in this legislative term.</p>
<p class="contents">The present compromise shows that Europe is now taking climate change seriously. This compromise, which transcends national boundaries, is also an indication that internationally we are making progress when it comes not just to climate protection but to energy efficiency too. I am particularly pleased that all aircraft above 5.7 tonnes are included in the measures and that certain aircraft, such as corporate jets, are not excluded. The public would not have understood it if we had provided exemptions for privileged groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had many hearings in this House in recent weeks and months on the subject of climate change. Every single expert has said that we need to halt the trend for emission levels and we need to do it in the coming decade. With this compromise we have succeeded in stopping the trend in the aviation sector. In 2012 we shall introduce an upper limit of 97% in the allocation of certificates, which will be reduced to 95% from 2013. This will halt the trend in this specific sector, where emission levels have been rising rapidly, increasing by 73% between 1990 and 2003. We can then set about achieving a trend reversal.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Some of my fellow Members have already mentioned this: 85% of the certificates will be allocated free of charge, while 15% will be auctioned. I would have preferred a more ambitious approach here. However, this is a compromise that everyone can now live with and a compromise is better than going to third reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The revenue should be used to combat climate change and to fund adaptation measures. This is explicitly stated in the directive. I would once more call on Member States to actually employ the money for this purpose and not to use it for plugging holes in some budget or other. These revenues must be allocated appropriately, otherwise they will be perceived as an additional tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that the directive is to be reviewed in 2014, which will allow us to establish whether we need to make readjustments somewhere or can adopt a more ambitious approach.</p>
<p class="contents">During the legislative process for NO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions I supported the introduction of a multiplier system.

My surprise is at the speed at which Parliament’s rapporteur, in a back-room meeting with the Council Presidency, managed to sweep practically everything from the table that Parliament has considered to be of importance to this dossier over the last two years. This should not be the benchmark for our debate of the energy package that is before us, for that is back-room politics not transparent democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am pleased that we have kept our feet on the ground. In our inclusion of the airlines it is especially important to keep the cost of the system down, for any airline today that does not operate an efficient fuel management regime pays for it with their own demise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am concerned at the wishful thinking that seems to be affecting many of us as regards the international situation. Mr Liese, emissions trading in the US was not rejected by the President but was defeated in the Senate, in which the party that holds the majority could well be providing the President the next time round. We really need to be realistic in our assessment of the situation, for even if we succeed in convincing the Americans to join in the emissions trading system we shall still be faced with a list of other countries around the world and I personally am not sure how we are ever going to start talking to them. I am thinking for example of the Emir of Dubai.</p>
<p class="contents">In commercial terms this region is for us a much greater challenge and the competition from that particular source is much more significant than that which comes from a couple of – if you will forgive the word – bankrupt US airlines. This is something that we have completely ignored. It is very important to keep a sense of proportion, a sense of perspective when debating that we should certainly move ahead but not make so much progress that the others can no longer keep up with us. We are provoking a trade war here. This is something, Mr Liese, that you must have been made aware of one-to-one during your hearings in the US Congress, though funnily enough you will never say that openly here.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we now have a compromise that is fairly realistic but, it is to be hoped, in terms of procedure is not ...</p>

One is, of course, an achievement – the fact that from 2012 quota trading will begin throughout the sector, and also in the three state companies that operate flights within the European Union. Secondly, though, I would like to emphasise the special 3% quota that offers additional opportunities to young and very quickly growing EU companies, with an average growth of more than 18% in four years. I think this will give them the opportunity to compete on those markets and at the same time it will also establish a quota ceiling of one million for such companies.

I am only sorry that despite his best efforts the agreement we have before us today is one that my group can support only very reluctantly. That is a direct result of the deeply disappointing lack of ambition shown by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For years now, governments have been talking with such enthusiasm about the ETS as the great answer to ensuring that aviation makes a real contribution to emissions reductions. Trading does indeed have the potential to play a useful role, but everything depends on the design of the scheme. Because of the Council’s intransigence the agreement we have today is a far cry from what is really needed and represents starkly the enormous gap between our governments’ rhetoric on climate change and the degree of political will that they are actually willing to muster.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement lacks crucial aspects, like a gateway to limit the degree to which aviation can just carry on business as usual by buying up emission permits from other sectors. It lacks full auctioning of emission permits despite the fact that it fulfils the Commission’s criterion of being able to fully pass on the costs, and it lacks a cap which is anywhere near as demanding as that required of other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Parliament has done its best, and the agreement before us does at least represent some improvements on the common position. It is a small step in the right direction, but it is also a truly missed opportunity for what could have been. In order for it to become meaningful and for aviation emissions to be genuinely addressed we must now make sure the efforts are rapidly scaled up and given the environmental integrity they urgently need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of the world’s biggest glaciers are now sliding from the inland ice in Greenland out into the North Atlantic. Never before have so much ice and snow melted as over recent years. I saw it with my own eyes on a visit to Greenland last year. Everyone, including the experts on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are amazed at the melt which is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">This frightening development is of course directly linked to our emissions and to global warming. It is we in the rich world – the USA, Australia, Japan and of course the EU – who are to blame for this. That is why we must subject all sectors which contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases to a critical examination.</p>
<p class="contents">The air transport industry has increased its emissions by around 100% since 1990. The air transport industry has got off lightly so far. Aviation fuel is exempt from tax, and local and regional authorities often subsidise airports in Europe. Here in the EU we fly as never before.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise on which we now have to decide unfortunately falls far short of the necessary action that we in the GUE/NGL Group wanted. The reduction targets for aviation should have been higher; emissions other than CO<span class="sub">2</span> should have been included; emission rights should not be distributed free of charge. This is at all events an agreement which is a small step in the right direction. Aviation will be forced to reduce its emissions, and a small proportion of emission rights must be put out to auction. The auctioning process will also generate revenue, which will be used for climate measures in Europe and in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to put a question to the Commission: can you give a pledge that countries which want to adopt parallel measures to reduce the emissions from aviation, such as the United Kingdom’s Air Passenger Duty, can continue to do so? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a positive move, for we all support the European commitment to climate change and we all agree that we need to reduce CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, although not at any cost. We thus need an international agreement and without doubt the ICAO must play its part. The European Union must play a decisive role in the debates held within the framework of the ICAO in order to ensure a realistic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We still want to see a more competitive Europe; surely we do not need to shoot ourselves in the foot and thus be determined to include airlines from third countries. We need to be careful not to damage our low-cost airlines or even our large airlines, which could decide to stop serving certain markets that are too costly. In the end, it will be the consumer at the bottom of the chain who will suffer and who might begin to see air travel as a luxury. We therefore have a compromise that is essential for the talks in Poznań at the end of 2009 and, of course, for our Copenhagen commitment in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one very important point: the proceeds generated by the auctions. The European Parliament will be very vigilant about the use of these proceeds, which must be used for clean transport, which must be used for research and development in the aviation sector, but which, above all, must not be used for other purposes; otherwise, the effects will be particularly devastating and could hinder the conclusion of an international agreement. It will therefore be important to step up the fight against CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions by ensuring the simultaneous implementation of the other elements of the policy: the technological element and the ‘single sky’ element. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could have been better but it does establish some very important principles about auctioning and about the use of the resources. It also shows that Europe is serious about climate change. Madam Minister, you said that we want to show the world that we can tackle climate change, that we do not just talk the talk at European summits, but that we walk the walk in legislation in the European Union. I think the agreement here today is a good sign that we can, if we want to, get the agreement on the climate change package before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">But you will have heard, as will the Commissioner, people in this House suggesting that they are not so happy with the agreement put together by Mr Liese. I would ask them what the alternative is. What are they suggesting instead if they do not think Europe should take a lead on aviation? What are we going to take a lead on? What are we going to do about the emissions trading scheme? Are we going to wait until something in the White House changes? Minister and Commissioner, I hope that you will both stick to your guns and that we will work together with Mrs Doyle on the emissions trading scheme. This is an agreement on aviation. We want to work on shipping as well. If we are asking citizens to play their part in tackling climate change, we have to do our bit here in this European Union on legislation. So I ask those on the other side of the House, who are not here now, but who have expressed doubts, to come up with alternatives if they have better ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rising oil prices have significantly reduced the extent to which air carriers are able to raise prices of transport services, which, together with the additional requirement to cover the costs of purchases under the emissions trading scheme, will put a brake on growth in this sector, as well as delaying or even making it impossible to introduce ecological solutions. For this reason it would be sensible to avoid sudden and risky measures in the air transport sector, especially in new Member States, which are only now beginning to catch up. There is no point in restricting air transport without providing a practical alternative, or providing the time necessary for systematic adaptation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The inclusion of aviation activities in the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme is a logical step. There will be free distribution of 85% of the permits, but at the end of the day it is the polluter who pays. This gives us the opportunity to rein in climate change. We will have greater opportunities to retain our quality of life in Europe. I am very grateful to Mr Liese, the rapporteur; working together with him we have found an excellent solution for the special reserve, which has been provided for rapidly growing aviation companies. Latvia’s accession to the European Union made it one of the fastest growing states, and I am also proud of our national airline, airBaltic, whose growth in recent years has been as high as 50%. The European Parliament is developing a high-quality environmental policy, in conjunction with a responsible transport policy. Of course, this will also have an effect on the European tourism industry. I am convinced that responsible tourism can lead to a much better quality of life. Responsible, high-quality tourism forms the basis of Europe’s tourism policy and is a driving force for the economy, and it causes far less damage to the environment, infrastructure and culture. The adoption of the directive on the inclusion of aviation activities in the ETS certainly undermines the status of the aviation industry, and most of all the ‘holy cow’ status of national airlines. Perhaps it was high time for this, though. Once again, I would like to thank Mr Liese, and I call upon you to support his report, the first raft of compromise amendments and the special 3% reserve for newly arrived and rapidly growing companies. On behalf of rapidly growing companies, I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank him, not because this is required by good manners, but on the rapporteur’s own merits. Mr Liese is a colleague who has understood the duty of a rapporteur. It is not to force the group to listen to his own ideas, but to make people want to listen to and find out about the group’s ideas and do them justice. Mr Liese has done that very well, so thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked together on air traffic for several years. We can be relatively pleased with the final outcome, taking into account the fact that emissions trading as a unilateral activity can never be a desirable way of working. A unilateral decision may cause trade disputes and also, in the worst case scenario, airspace disputes. Carbon leakage is a danger, since it has a direct impact on the environment, but especially on the European economy and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This threat is real, because airlines are being punished right now by higher oil prices. There have been many bankruptcies and traffic has been shut down. We want this decision to be made quickly and not to wait for the results of Copenhagen in this matter, and we want to achieve an international sector agreement. Instead, the Single European Sky, which would generate carbon dioxide savings immediately – 12 per cent a year – has been awaiting ratification for more than ten years. This shows that emissions trading is not always about protecting the environment but more about politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will be accepted for worldwide emissions trading for air traffic as soon as possible, and that it will not cause any carbon leakage but really reward a reduction in emissions and the rationalisation of all kinds of activities, bearing the environmental targets in mind. Now, emissions trading mainly punishes European companies, which on the whole fly with very new fleets. This being the case, it was wise to relinquish the use of the multiplier factor in this phase, because it would have led to cheating and the environmental benefits would have been small.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that my opinion on ploughing the profit from emissions trading into research on reducing emissions from air traffic in particular has been adopted in the final compromise. It would have been a serious mistake to keep air traffic out of it and invest the funds into competing modes of transport, as was proposed to begin with.

He has succeeded in reaching a compromise with the Member States at Council and, although it may not be as ambitious as some might have hoped for (perhaps that is the sign of a good compromise), it does deliver the framework for including the fastest-growing transport sector in the EU ETS from 2012. As rapporteur on the review of the EU ETS proposal, I understand the complexities behind this issue and the difficulties in negotiating a good and balanced compromise. Peter has shown that it can be done, and my challenge will be to replicate his success in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the EU-sponsored deregulation of the sector, EU citizens have spent around EUR 80 billion a year on flight tickets, and this figure does not even include the low-cost carriers. There can be no doubt that access to lower fares, even zero fares in recent times, has made travel more accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given the problems we face in the light of global climate change and the 2°C target, it would seem irresponsible to exclude the aviation sector, and indeed the maritime sector, from contributing to the urgent solution of the fastest-growing global problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to move towards a thriving low-carbon economy and to drive innovation and new technologies, and emissions trading is the most cost-effective way of achieving these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the aviation sector is able to pass on costs to the consumer, it makes sense that allowances should be allocated via auctioning, even in the present fuel price climate, which makes any talk of passing on costs especially sensitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The new system will apply to both intra-EU and international flights, including third-country airlines, ensuring that the competitiveness of EU airlines is secured. The management of airports, air traffic control and a single European sky all have a huge contribution to make in decreasing fuel consumption and thereby reducing costs of fuel and carbon credits for the airlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget the importance of air transport in providing a link with the continent and between these islands so that their populations do not feel trapped. It is therefore essential to guarantee that, at the very least, there is an exemption scheme for the outermost regions. We therefore insist that the air links of the outermost regions, not only between themselves, but also with the continent, are excluded from the application of this scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this compromise represents a balance between the environmental requirements and the quality-related economic constraints. If you approve this compromise, you will be taking an important step for European Union. You will be proving firstly that Europe is capable of developing its own legislation to combat climate change and, of course, it augurs well for the discussions on the climate/energy package.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be strengthening Europe’s role as a leader in the global policy against anthropogenic carbon emissions, which also augurs well for the international negotiations in Poznań in December 2008 and Copenhagen in December 2009. Finally, you will encourage the figures and political forces among our international partners who wish to give fresh impetus to the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am thinking, of course, of the bilateral talks we could have with countries that wish to implement the same type of system, but also the multilateral discussions within the framework of the ICAO. For all these reasons I ask you to support this agreement.</p>

By reaching an agreement on this directive the Community institutions are demonstrating their determination to adopt the concrete measures which are necessary to implement the European Union’s ambitious climate change goals.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is the first of a series of measures which are designed to deliver on the European Union’s greenhouse gas objective by 2020. Its adoption is a positive signal for the forthcoming negotiations on the climate and energy package and the international negotiations in Poznań and Copenhagen. I have just been informed that the G8 have agreed on a long-term reduction target of 50% in 2050. Although we welcome this, it is only a partial step forward because they failed to agree on a mid-term target despite the fact that both the European Union Member States and the Commission insisted on the necessity of a mid-term target.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, on the basis of the agreed text, all flights to and from the European Union airports will be fully included in the European Union emissions trading scheme from 2012. This means that from 2012 aircraft operators will need emission allowances to cover their flights into and out of the European Union. In 2012 the number of emissions allowances allocated to the aviation sector will be 3% below the sector’s average annual emissions for the years 2004-2006. From 2013 the number of allowances will be 5% lower. Like other industries in the scheme, they will be able to sell any allowances they do not need on the market, but if their emissions are higher they will need to buy more allowances or emission credits from clean energy projects in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how the emissions trading scheme creates an incentive for participants to minimise their emissions. The majority of allowances to airlines will be free but 15% of allowances will be auctioned. The revenues from this auctioning should be used to tackle climate change in the European Union and third countries, especially developing countries. This level may be increased from 2013 as part of the ongoing discussions to revise the emissions trading directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In January this year the Commission proposed that 20% of allowances for aviation should be auctioned in 2013, increasing to 100% in 2020. While supporting this agreement, the Commission position in the context of the revised emissions trading directive remains that the auctioning level in the aviation sector should be 20% in 2013 and increased in line with sectors other than the power sector. For these sectors it is proposed to auction 20% of allowances in 2013, increasing to 100% in 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of nitrogen oxide emissions, the Commission indicated in its original proposal that a separate measure would be proposed to address nitrogen oxide emissions and can make the following declaration:</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission recalls that it intends to issue by December 2008 a legislative proposal to introduce measures to limit nitrogen oxide emissions from aviation, in particular to address effectively the climate change impact and to avoid any negative incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at the expense of nitrogen oxides.’</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission is very pleased. I would like to particularly thank Dr Liese for his excellent work and results. We are very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations. The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full.</p>

I would also like to thank you for the criticisms that have been expressed in some quarters.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to clarify some things again: one of the speakers said that we had been indulging in back-room politics. I do not believe this was the case. The whole process was very open and the speaker himself was present at every stage, the shadow rapporteur was kept informed of all the details and in my group we also discussed matters among ourselves. I do not know if that also happened in the speaker’s group, but in any case for us it was all very open and above board, even on an internal level.</p>
<p class="contents">We managed to get the Council of Ministers to accept many of our proposals. The Commissioner said that it was more ambitious than the original Commission proposal and the number of amendments alone that we succeeded in putting through – some 30 in all – shows that we were able to alter the common position, and in some cases quite substantially.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lucas, Mr Holm and others have said that all this falls short of the expectations of the environmental groups. That is correct, but neither would it have been a good compromise if we had incorporated everything that the environmentalists and Greens had been demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">In two areas – and the Commissioner also referred to these – there is still some room for adjustment. With the report presented by Avril Doyle we again have an opportunity to adjust the cap and the auctioning level so that they are fair to other participants in the emissions trading system We need to look very closely at this in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should again like to stress that what we want is equal terms of competition. We want a global agreement and we also want to include in it flights from third countries. However, it is about time that the airlines helped us out. I see a letter from the AEA – the Association of European Airlines – stating that even after the compromise has been reached other governments will understandably reject it. We need to consider whether we should still be engaging such people, as they make very poor lobbyists.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall now be adopting this agreement with a very large majority and will then join forces to plead our case before third countries. Then we will all be working together. However, if Parliament’s democratic decision is not accepted we will have to tell the airlines that they are only harming themselves. I ask you to approve the recommendation and would like to express my thanks for the broad support I have received. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Negotiations for this compromise have been difficult because they had to take into consideration the oil price, the competitiveness of European airlines and environmental protection, attempting to create a model system on the international scene for including aviation into the ETS. Nevertheless, the system should not endanger precisely the European airlines, which could lose their competitiveness in relation to the competing aviation sector in the US or Dubai. Penalizing the internal aviation industry will cause the occurrence of the “carbon leakage” phenomenon, namely the orientation towards markets with less strict rules than those imposed by the EU, thus starting a commercial war. We need to find a balance between environmental protection, consumer protection and the aviation sector if we want the European airspace to be more efficient.</p>

<p class="contents">We support Parliament’s decision to reform the hearing procedure in a way that will further increase the transparency and the democratic legitimacy of the appointment procedure by establishing clear, transparent and uniform procedures and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission considers that the procedures to be applied in the different cases covered by the report have to fully respect the relevant provisions of the Treaties, notably Article 215, and of the Framework Agreement, so as to reflect the legal and institutional differences between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically the procedures applied for portfolio reshuffles should be lighter than those applied for approving the whole Commission, and should respect the prerogatives of the President of the European Commission for the allocation of portfolios.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this is in the interest of both institutions. Furthermore, the Commission is legally bound by the Treaties and the Framework Agreement and therefore reserves its right to agree the relevant procedures to be applied in each of the different scenarios on a case-by-case basis and in a constructive spirit of cooperation, as has so far been the case. This approach has proved successful for both institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

This is indeed very disappointing because labelling does not guarantee safety. Parliament has now lost control in this area and has simply given in, and has unfortunately not applied the precautionary approach. That is very regrettable.</p>

The alarming findings of the Southampton study make it quite clear that we must call for a ban and that we need a ban.</p>

The European Council and the European Parliament have jointly decided to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2020, and in fact its international agreements stipulate a reduction of 30%, then 60% or 80% by 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these targets, all emitters, all industries and even we humans, on behalf of our households, have to make major efforts. If we lived in a perfect world where the fuels available to us were unlimited and cheap and where there were no ever-increasing environmental problems, I would not have voted for this present legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not have voted in favour of it because it is clearly restrictive and it is disadvantageous to the new Member States and to the Hungarian airline. However, we do not live in a perfect world, the amount of fuel is falling and the price of fuel is rising, but we have to do something today in order to halt climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, albeit in the knowledge that this legislation will put the airlines of the new Member States in a difficult position, I have voted in favour of this legislation because I feel, in the interests of the future, that the targets we have adopted jointly must be met. We must halt climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result is an integrated conceptual text that is perfectly valid for the inclusion of aviation in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, thereby abolishing by the end of 2012 today’s system of giving advantages to air traffic in relation to ground-based traffic. In addition to that, the motion for a resolution is kind to new enterprises thanks to the 15% auction allowance and it broadens the scheme in regard to flights from and to Europe. Continuing my line of thought from last November, I would stress that in order to lower emissions in the atmosphere we must persuade the rest of the world of the necessity to regulate. I believe that soon we will manage to sign an agreement with the US and other countries. I welcome the limit on exemptions. I personally cannot see why the flights of heads of state or monarchs (in contrast to flights for rescue purposes) should not be subject to the same rules on environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Aviation accounts for less than 5% of the total emissions in the transport sector and in this respect we are to some extent playing token politics here. Besides, we have not been able, as Europeans, to find a global approach to this issue, which means that our measures will put European airlines and airports too at an unfair disadvantage. What is more, we have basically failed – as would have been made clear – to carry out a proper cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the measures we have agreed on today are neither sensible nor necessary and we have created here a situation that is not convenient and that basically runs counter to the Lisbon Strategy. We have not in fact strengthened Europe’s position; we have handicapped it and we have done it one-sidedly, which is why I am against the common position. We would have done better to put more into our infrastructure and create a common European airspace. This could have produced cost savings that would have been much more beneficial than the measures we have now set in motion here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet the opposite is being claimed. It is being maintained that people want to see more debates, while at the same time the debates on the own-initiative reports are being abolished and are being replaced by written statements. However, the word Parliament comes from <span class="italic">parlare</span> and not from ‘minute keeping’. That is for bureaucrats. People talk about having more time for legislative work. We could have this on Thursdays and on Fridays. The problem is that we do not use it. That is the reason why we do not have enough time for legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">True parliamentary reform – and here I concede to Mr Sumberg – would be something completely different. We are taking away our own rights, we are reducing the amount of speaking time, we can no longer table amendments, which means that we are giving up our own capacity to compromise. There will henceforth only be ideological arguments over rigid texts.</p>

It was when she had the budget the last time that I managed to table just under 500 amendments to her budget for discussion in committee, and a number of those came forward to plenary. She is a good person to work with and she understands many of the problems that I have with those elements of the Lisbon Treaty that are already being budgeted for, supposedly under the legal basis of financial perspectives agreed at Council – although I am pretty sure that is not correct. She understands that I have a big problem with lots of NGOs being funded by the Commission budget to lobby the Commission to do more things in a bizarre symbiotic relationship that should no longer go forward, and she knows I have a very special relationship with the Special Olympics movement, which should benefit from the European budget at some point in the future.</p>

<p class="contents">Their petition resulted in a public hearing and in a European Parliament report, which highlighted the need to include other countries, and the EU in particular, in the decision-making process. The problems are due to the ecological risks that exist as a result of vast graveyards of warships and munitions at the bottom of the sea, and a risky chemical method needed to clean the pipeline before it enters into service.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not express an opinion on the land-based alternative route but I firmly believe that the European Commission and the Council must take up their role as coordinators duties and consistently demand – in the interest of the Baltic and other countries – that the investors assume full responsibility for potential ecological damage. The Commission and the Council must also request an independent impact assessment and an assessment of the alternative land-based route.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern gas supply route from Russia is important. Therefore, it is imperative that the EU signs an agreement with Russia regarding the conditions for monitoring the construction of the gas pipeline and for its safe operation. After all, Russia has not yet ratified the Espoo Convention. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a common EU energy policy or standards. We can clearly see that instead of a bilateral agreement between Germany and Russia, Europeans need an EU agreement and the consent of the Baltic countries to the construction. Parliament is now sending a clear political signal in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no benefit in the amendments, which only weaken the conclusions. The gas pipeline is dangerous for the environment, for the sea and for the countries on the Baltic Sea. Another issue is the cost of construction, which is several times more than if Nord Stream built the pipeline overland. It would be the population of Germany and Europe that would have to pay for these additional costs, as the costs of construction would be added to the price of every cubic metre of gas sold. Who will earn from this? Lobbyists, the construction company and Russian politicians. For this money you could build several nuclear power stations, which would reduce the use of gas and CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p>

<p class="contents">The Baltic Sea is a typical inland sea, with a shallow basin and a limited exchange of waters with world oceans. In addition, there is a large amount of chemical weaponry sunk on the Baltic seabed and this could lead to an ecological disaster during construction in this basin, which is a very important one from the European point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is another, more important issue raised in this report. Energy investments involving EU Member States should be the subject of the combined attention and care of Europe and all the EU and its citizens, not just of one country, in this case Germany. We must think first and foremost of European solidarity and ensuring energy security for the whole of Europe. This is not what is happening today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will send a clear signal from the European Parliament to the Council and the Commission but, especially, to the Government of Germany, that it should not be just two countries taking decisions on the Baltic pipeline, but this should be done with the understanding and agreement of this House and all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would therefore say quite clearly that this project can only be realised if the fears and concerns of the neighbouring European countries, and EU partners, are taken seriously and if they agree to it.

What is more, and the Polish and Czech Members can take my word for this, the same goes for other issues such as missile sites and the issuing of visas.</p>

Europe has used many enlightened policies at a Community level to tackle heroin abuse, and in many ways it is leading the world on how to tackle the problem through its treatment and other such programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the moment 90% of the heroin that is reaching the streets of Europe is coming from Afghanistan. I believe that the policies we are undertaking there at the moment are not really working. The open economy in Afghanistan and the insurgency are mutually reinforcing. Drugs finance the Taliban, while the resulting lawlessness and violence facilitate poppy cultivation. Many attempts have been made to try to persuade farmers to change from poppies to other crops but unfortunately they have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that there are still fields of poppies in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand and Kandahar, as this lucrative business is worth about USD 500 million per year to opium farmers and about USD 3.5 billion to the smuggling and refining business. By not effectively addressing this problem at source and by not providing sustainable and alternatives to opium farmers, we are failing not only the citizens of Afghanistan but also the citizens of Europe. What is happening at the moment, unfortunately, is that Afghanistan is turning into another narcostate, and look at all the problems that emerged from Colombia when that was allowed to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that it is not easy. I recognise that to try and tackle this within Afghanistan is extremely difficult for all the people who are trying to tackle it, but I believe that the policies we are undertaking at the moment are not really working. I do not know what the solution is. I have read a lot about it and I realise that there are people out there who are putting their lives on the line to try and tackle this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the heroin problem in Europe is beginning to increase. In Ireland this year the authorities have seized a record amount of heroin and recent reports have shown a big problem for young women with heroin-abuse problems in the state. As a former minister responsible for drugs, I believe that greater coordination to effectively combat illegal drug trafficking is needed among all EU Member States and also with other states surrounding Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was also going to make the same points as my wise colleague, Mr David Sumberg. I cannot believe the general cheek of this place even talking about this subject, when you consider how many of our Member States have got their troops in frontline action in Afghanistan. I have lots of constituents, two of whom have recently come back in body bags from Afghanistan, and I promise you, no one wants to put troops in harm’s way, but this really is a vital cause for us.</p>

Given the funding needs, it was important to clarify the existing provisions on Community funds managed by financial intermediaries because the current text is ambiguous about the possibility of continuing to re-invest such funds. Moreover, it seems logical to authorise the European Investment Bank (EIB) to re-invest within the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) the funds reflowing from past operations. As the earlier Regulations did not provide for the possibility of re-investing the funds, the ‘reflows’ are returned to the Community budget.

<p class="contents">The report by the rapporteur, Mr Peter Liese, is a balanced and realistic solution, a compromise between protecting the environment on the one hand, and ensuring the competitiveness of the European aviation industry on the other. We must not discriminate against European aviation companies, in particular those from the new EU Member States that are trying to catch up with the general trend. Consequently, the rules of healthy economic competition must apply in equal measure to aviation companies from third countries. It is necessary to conclude an international agreement, and for that reason the EU must negotiate with the US, Russia and China.</p>

Emissions from aviation have increased by almost 90% over the past few years.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time aviation gets away without paying excise duty on aviation fuel and VAT on flight tickets. Legislative measures are therefore necessary. The report aims to have the trading system start from 2011 for all flights arriving at or departing from European aerodromes. From 2012 the sector will have to emit 1.5% fewer greenhouse gases per year. The proposed level of free auctioning rights is far too high. I think that the aviation sector should start auctioning at least 25%. Ultimately the goal is not the trading itself but the reduction in emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also expressed a view on the use of the proceeds generated by auctioning: it wants that money to be used to reduce taxes on environmentally-friendly forms of transport and to invest in research into technology for less polluting aircraft.

The idea that 40 Members can present an alternative resolution just as the political groups can is, in my opinion, a step forward for democracy, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PDB totals EUR 134 395 billion in commitment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.04% of GNI, an increase of 3.1% compared with 2008, and EUR 116.7 billion in payment appropriations, leaving a margin of EUR 2.6 billion under commitments and EUR 7.4 billion under payments.

<p class="contents">For this reason it is even more important for the European Union to have the financial resources required to implement current policies and activities in different areas, while at the same time having sufficient flexibility to deal with new political challenges. For this reason the unusually low level of funds proposed for payments in the initial draft budget (EUR 116 736 billion), which is 0.90% of GNP, or a decrease of 3.3% in relation to 2008, is very surprising. Also worrying are the budget decreases proposed by the European Commission for information campaigns that were planned a long time ago for 2009, for the European Parliament elections or for the possible entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority for the July conciliation meeting on the budget should be to ensure an appropriate level of funds for payments and for the Union’s information policy. It is also vital to present the Commission with funding proposals for pilot projects and preparatory works, in order to avoid financing them from the reserves of multi-annual financial frameworks. In addition, we should ensure that there are sufficient financial resources for the European Union to be able to react to new challenges in the area of ‘competitiveness for growth and employment’, without reducing the existing funds for important programmes that are currently being implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They fundamentally belong together, like taxation and the budget or law and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">There can no longer be an energy policy without financial or other such instruments that make its components possible. The White Papers that discuss the energy matters of the Union and its Member States have repeatedly demanded clean, independent and competitive forms of energy – but there is only a functioning market mechanism for the last criterion, competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I still do not see any market mechanisms that would reduce our dependence on energy – and especially not on gas from Russia. This week, the European Energy Forum will hold discussions with OPEC. It is not a weakness for OPEC that it is an indispensable cartel that has too great an influence on our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The dependence on energy resulting from the mistakes of previous generations has been allowed to grow and flourish at our expense. It is a factor that we should remember when we make decisions on future solutions, even in the case of gas pipelines and other economic dependence. Is it sustainable development, and is it the right direction, when we are striving for a low-carbon economy?</p>

<p class="contents">This, the longest and shallowest gas mains pipeline in the world, poses a serious threat to biodiversity and natural habitats, as well as to the safety and movement of shipping in this region, not to mention the approximately 80 000 MT of ammunition sunk here during the Second World War.

<p class="contents">With the growing dependence of the EU on a small number of energy sources and their suppliers, it is important to support initiatives aimed at diversification; we should stop to think whether the Russian company Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares in the Nord Stream consortium, is the best solution in this context? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report, which comes at a pivotal time for the country’s future, highlights the challenges that face the European Union in terms of making an effective contribution to the stabilisation of the country. It points to the reconstruction efforts that have already been made to strengthen the institutions and improve living conditions. In this respect, the significant decrease in infant mortality and the rise in the number of children attending school are encouraging signs.</p>
<p class="contents">Success in Afghanistan will require better coordination among donors of the various strategies. Security must of course continue to be a priority, but it is also crucial for the Afghan people to see how the aid specifically benefits them. It is essential to build additional basic infrastructures, be they roads, schools, hospitals, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the process will also require ‘Afghanisation’ of the stabilisation process: the Afghan people must be given the tools to enable them to take charge of their future. In this respect, many hopes rest on the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), which must be supported by the international community and by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the report says that the military activities of the Taliban do not pose a direct threat to Afghanistan’s sovereignty, and on the other hand there is the warning that Afghanistan is now at a critical crossroads.</p>
<p class="contents">I would see it differently. President Karzai himself clearly says that the coalition forces are not winning the fight against the Taliban and adds – very fittingly I would say – that winning the war against terrorism will be possible only if some of the Afghan Government’s partners stop pursuing their own (different) interests. The war waged in the past in Afghanistan by the former Soviet Union proved that this country cannot be stabilised, let alone governed, by military means. Political, economic and social measures, affecting not only Afghanistan but also neighbouring countries, are the only effective way to achieve stabilisation. Let me add that US hegemonic interests in the region are probably the key aspect in this serious problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It stresses that the EU ‘should use the experience and expertise of its missions and of those Member States that already have a military or civilian presence on Afghanistan territory.’ In other words, it should utilise the homicidal acts of its military forces in the country as an opportunity to gain operational experience for its imperialist interventions elsewhere too.

The first is ensuring a safe, sustainable, competitive supply via an effective, operational and interconnected network. The second is a transformation that is needed to combat greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, in particular, and in this area as a whole, I would like to highlight the progress made by the Slovenian Presidency, which resulted in the adoption of a general framework for the ‘internal energy market’ package as a whole at the June Council. The most important element of the compromise reached relates to the effective separation – and I stress the word ‘effective’ – of production and supply activities, on the one hand, from network operations, on the other. I will mention here the form of solution that the Council adopted <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis</span> for the gas and electricity sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Although several Member States and the Commission prefer full ownership unbundling, the Member States wanted to retain some flexibility, and the Council agreed to an option that provided for an independent transmission operator. This option would be available for the Member States whose transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated company on the date on which the directive enters into force. This option implies significant adjustments to guarantee the independence of the transmission operators in terms of decision-making, of course, but also financing.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem that the mechanism adopted makes it possible to avoid conflicts of interest between the various bodies of an integrated company and to ensure a balance between the independence of the transmission operator, its development plan and its investment needs, on the one hand, and the financial interests of the parent company, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention was paid in this respect to system development and the guarantee of a compromise that does not discriminate between system operators. The action of these operators will be monitored by the regulatory authorities. The role and action of the regulatory authorities will be reinforced by the establishment of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, which is long-awaited and whose creation was approved by the European Parliament last month.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight some of the other important elements of this ‘internal market liberalisation’ package: firstly, the crucial issue of infrastructures and the emphasis on the Europe-wide 10-year investment plan. This is a vital new element that should promote integration and modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, another key aspect is investment by third countries in the transmission systems, which is very closely linked to energy security issues. We must find a pragmatic solution that is adapted to each case. The discussions in the Council are going on at this very moment and I am sure that they will result in a compromise that is acceptable to all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The next stage, ladies and gentlemen, will be the confirmation of these general elements through the adoption of a political agreement on 10 October at the Energy Council, followed by the transmission of the common position in November or December. That will allow the discussions between our institutions in the context of a second reading to begin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to the second point. I believe that it is essential to establish a low-carbon economy, in which each Member State is of course free to choose the energy sources it wishes to use. The goals of, and investments in, this global transformation of the economy must focus on the long term and they pose numerous technological challenges for the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a number of them: the commercial use of CO<span class="sub">2 </span>capture and storage, the doubling of the production capacity of the largest wind farms, the commercial maturity of photovoltaic or thermodynamic solar energy, sustainably produced second-generation biofuels, the introduction onto the public market of mechanisms allowing more efficient end use of energy in construction, transport and industry, the crucial advances in the energy efficiency of materials, biosciences and information technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In February the Council, on the basis of the Commission’s guidelines, Commissioner, adopted conclusions containing a number of operational elements, which I will mention here. The first is the introduction and launch of the six industrial initiatives proposed by the Commission: wind, solar, bioenergy, CO<span class="sub">2</span> capture, transport and storage, electricity grids and, finally, sustainable nuclear fission. The measures also seek to support and encourage research, particularly in the field of energy efficiency, and the establishment of agreements between public authorities, industry and researchers with a view to supporting the objectives laid down in the Strategic Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for the work they have done until now and I hope that our positions on the internal energy market will converge at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, I am very pleased to be here again today to discuss the second part of the internal energy market package, namely gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month this House discussed electricity and the Agency. Many amendments are very similar for gas and I will not go into all the points which were raised when we discussed electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first of all congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr La Russa and Mr Paparizov, on their excellent reports, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and all the members of the committees involved. You have managed to maintain a high-quality debate, taking into account very short deadlines for rather complicated legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain why gas market liberalisation is as essential as electricity market liberalisation for a competitive, sustainable and secure energy supply in the European Union. I will also stress that they require the same legislative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Gas is one of the main energy sources in the EU for both industry and households. Energy prices are spiking: now, more than ever, EU consumers need a competitive gas market so that they pay only the cost for efficient supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the electricity market will not function properly if the gas market does not function properly. I would like to quote the International Energy Agency: ‘In many regions, gas-fired plant sets the price of electricity a significant proportion of the time. Expensive gas therefore means expensive electricity. ... Policymakers must appreciate the growing intertwining of gas and electricity industries, and design markets and regulatory systems accordingly.’</p>
<p class="contents">This is even more the case at a time when we need more renewable energy. As the wind and sun do not always function as we would wish, electricity production is difficult to predict. It needs the back-up of a source for electricity production that is predictable and very flexible, and this is gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Gas is also the cleanest of all fossil fuels. If we want to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change, it is one of the very efficient ways, but we need to make sure that our gas supply is competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Security of supply is also important. The best way to guarantee a secure gas supply to the EU is by having one internal market for 500 million consumers. The EU is loud and clear if it speaks with one voice. It is very incomprehensible if 27 voices speak at the same time. In a common market we need to work together because we have one common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">All these arguments underline the importance of measures on which we will take up a position today. I am glad to say that they support most of your amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We need effective independence of system operators to ensure investments and optimal network use.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, ownership unbundling is the most efficient way to achieve this independence. But not everybody agrees and, as you know, the Council has reached agreement on the independent transmission operator option. I believe that an alternative to just ownership unbundling should be given a chance, just as Europe was built using a step-by-step approach.</p>
<p class="contents">You have asked for a stronger Agency. I agree with you on the principle, but we need to stay within the boundaries of the Treaty. We are bound by the Treaty and so-called Meroni jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. In particular, we need comitology to make codes binding. The Agency can then control the procedure and the implementation. A strong Agency is not in conflict with comitology. On the contrary, the Agency needs guidelines to frame its powers so that it can take individual binding decisions on market players.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to storage and LNG is as important as access to the networks. We welcome your efforts to improve access to storage in the directive. To make sure that these access rules are effective, we need legal unbundling of the storage operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency is also the key part of our proposals that you have underlined in the previous votes. Transparency should be the rule and confidentiality the exception, not only for network use but also for balancing, storage and LNG.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that many of the horizontal concerns, as regards the protection of vulnerable customers and the fight against energy poverty, have also been taken up in the gas report. These elements are essential in the implementation of market opening and should be strengthened. The Commission will look carefully at the wording in order to respect the principle of subsidiarity. It is important to confirm again that our policy should not prevent proper investment signals and market entry.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Council has clearly indicated its wish to try to find a solution at second reading. I can assure you that the Commission will play a very constructive role in finding the solution that is beneficial for all EU citizens and developing our strength, which is the internal energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second report, I would like to congratulate Mr Buzek for his excellent report and express my appreciation for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy’s support for the strategic energy technology (SET) plan initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that I have already overstepped my time limit. We have worked very closely with my colleague Janez Potočnik and so I will join in his views on this very important proposal, not just because I very much appreciate what Mr Buzek has done but because we really worked together in the Commission to move this dossier ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know that on energy and climate change we face an enormous challenge. It is perhaps the defining challenge of the 21st century. Let us be under no illusions that it will be easy. The targets we have set for Europe for 2020 are an important milestone, but they are no more than that. A much more profound change is needed in the longer term: a complete overhaul of the energy systems that have delivered our current prosperity and wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">To fulfil our promises we will need new knowledge and new tools. These will be delivered by research and innovation in energy technologies. That is why the SET Plan is so important for Europe. We need to snap out of the lethargy that has characterised energy innovation in recent decades. We have to invest more and better. We need a new mind-set in the way we work together in Europe to develop and deploy such technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome Parliament’s report on the SET Plan. It shows that there is a solid consensus at EU level for effective action in this area. Of course, we do not all agree on which technologies we need but, as we know, it is up to each Member State to decide on its preferences on the basis of their preferred energy mix, indigenous resource base and exploitation potential.</p>
<p class="contents">But more important than what we disagree on, for me, is what we all agree on. We agree on the crucial importance of energy savings and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that the capacity of the European research base has to be enlarged, strengthened and freed up to work in a much more dynamic and transnational manner. We agree on the need for more resources, public and private. And we agree on the need for enhanced international cooperation to face a global challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">You know my ambitions for the EU research policy and the development of the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">The SET Plan and the development of our research policy go hand in hand. I see it as a pioneer in many respects, including ERA initiatives such as joint programming. I believe that the SET Plan will start a process that will act as a model for the organisation of research and innovation activities within Europe, a process that will change the way we do research in Europe and one that will ultimately change Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I was present at the annual meeting of the DFG – the German Research Council. Their President, Matthias Kleiner, said something memorable: A vision without action is a daydream; action without a vision is a nightmare. There is probably no better example of how true that statement is than the SET Plan we are discussing today. We need a clear vision and we have to act urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that on this basis I can above all express my gratitude to all shadow rapporteurs with whom I worked in the process of preparing the report, as well as to the rapporteurs on the other two regulations, with whom we achieved a common approach to the resolution of third energy package problems. I would like to make a particular point of the fact that within the framework of our actions we confirmed the proposals of the Commission related to the establishment of a network of transmission network operators, but limited their functions in respect precisely to their obligations to fulfil technical tasks and develop the network, not to establish rules of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In our proposals we set aside an enormous role for the future Agency for cooperation between national regulators. It is precisely this agency that we think is the important authority which should, under the guidance of the Commission, determine the main trends and guidelines for development of the energy market, including the gas market. In this sense, the agency will not only fulfil functions on the approval of the codes, which are voluntary at this stage, but according to the last proposals we have made, through the Commission it will also be able to propose by way of comitology that some of the codes become mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the texts in respect to regional initiatives have an enormous importance for the development of the market. This regional investment plan, which is to be developed on the basis of the ten-year investment plan, will really help member-states cooperate on regional level as a stage for a future common energy market. Many other important matters related to transparency, and to boosting interaction between the participants on the market, have been resolved in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much encouraged by what Commissioner Piebalgs has said about his attitude to our proposals on the Agency and I believe that we can found, within the principles of the Meroni case and within the proposals of the Parliament, an Agency that will be viable – an Agency that will be parallel to the efforts of the Commission in the development of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am very much encouraged by what happened on 6 June in the Council and I believe that a good basis for compromise has been found. I am happy that Commissioner Piebalgs mentioned today this possible compromise unlike at the last meeting when we discussed electricity. I believe that with the support of the Commission, and of course in the trialogue that will develop, it will be possible to find a solution possibly by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a bit discouraged by the delays put forward by the French presidency. I believe we could work more expeditiously to keep the previous European Council wish that we finish the work by the end of this year, and not the end of this term, which would mean the middle of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Romano Maria La Russa, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. − </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at last on the home straight after many long months of work. It has certainly not been easy. Albeit with a few misgivings, I believe that the committee's proposals are equal to the arduous task of dismantling established monopolies. These, as well as preventing new competitors from accessing the market, have long restricted investment and the capacity for network interconnection.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who heard my speeches in the committee knows that I have regarded ownership unbundling as a priority right from the outset, so as to ensure that companies transporting gas are fully independent of companies generating it, even though of course ownership unbundling is no miracle cure for all ills. It goes without saying that, once a vertically integrated company is allowed – even if only temporarily – to retain ownership of transport systems, there is a need to establish effective regulatory control mechanisms which are neither too onerous nor too invasive.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, as we all know, the implementing measures for the gas directive will inevitably follow a different schedule from those for electricity. This difference emerged clearly in the Committee on Industry, which opted for the ITO – the Independent Transmission Operator – as an alternative to ownership unbundling. It is a compromise proposal, certainly not my own preferred option, but one that does go in the direction of greater liberalisation. Indeed, unlike the ISO, the ITO will be answerable to a separate body with genuine supervisory powers. I hope the Council will take up the ITO proposal as approved by the Committee on Industry. The fundamental role to be conferred on the Agency by the forthcoming legislative framework should be emphasised: it must not be a purely advisory role – as I fear might be the Council's intention – but one that envisages a broader remit for the Agency in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to attain the goal of reducing our energy dependence, we need a single energy market and a single integrated network. I therefore urge colleagues to support the amendments tabled by myself, and by other colleagues from various political groups, concerning the possibility of combining the various transport operators into one single European network company, in order to ensure that there is a single legislative framework and to guarantee market access for all operators, thereby overcoming the ‘unbundling yes; ownership unbundling no’ hurdle.</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important aspect of my report is the central role of consumers. I shall be brief. There needs to be a transparent, comprehensible means of determining tariffs, enabling consumers to access consumption data at any time and giving them freedom to change supplier if they so wish. Regarding the comitology procedure, I am pleased that the Commission has accepted my position: I believe that it is up to Member States to lay down the guidelines, rather than a committee speaking for the Commission alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the agreement reached between the political groups, and set out in my report, concerning the powers and role of national regulators: I think this is an important agreement, especially as regards the possibility of imposing sanctions. It is for us, ladies and gentlemen, to decide whether we want tomorrow to be remembered as a key moment in the creation of a single integrated energy market, which Europe needs in order to confront the challenges of the next millennium, or whether, on the other hand, it will mark the umpteenth climb-down, the result of a timid, cowardly reform effort which will basically be postponed until the next legislative term. I hope, moreover, that the Council will give due consideration to Parliament's decisions. That is not always the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is as if one were to talk about human rights and human diseases in a block because they are both ‘human’, which is not a very good idea. Similarly, the fact that they are both about ‘energy’ is not enough to link energy technology and the energy package together as they are very different topics.</p>
<p class="contents">But seeing both Commissioners here, I am very glad at this decision, because the SET Plan is very important for the European Union and needs strong support from some Commissioners and from the whole Commission. As you can see from the voting in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, you have support from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now go through the content of the SET plan. However, it would probably be easier if I change to my mother tongue, which I shall now do. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PL) </span>The European Union has decided to make a charge for emissions of carbon dioxide. This is a key decision. We are showing that we shall fight climate change. We are showing that we are a leader in this battle. On the other hand, we should remember that charges on carbon dioxide emissions create difficulties for the economy and result in higher production costs in almost every sector. I would like to emphasise that the energy sector itself will be hardest hit, particularly in countries where electricity or heat are generated using coal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal put forward by the European Commission concerning a strategic energy technology programme is, in my opinion, an excellent response to the threats to the European economy. It is all about reducing energy costs. The European Commission has introduced support for zero and low-emission technologies in ‘energy, production and energy processing’. For the first time we have all the methods for combating climate change and for energy security presented in one document. This means that nuclear power is also included. In fact, the continuing concerns of our colleagues, principally our colleagues from the Green Party, all the risks associated with nuclear power generation, are presented by them. However, today, the third generation of nuclear power stations is completely different from what was built in Chernobyl.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that there is full agreement as regards another great challenge and issue, namely the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. This is a new technology, so incentives are essential, as for any new and promising technology. As regards support for sustainable technologies in the power generation sector, this was never in doubt in Parliament. Parliament treats energy efficiency and energy saving as the most important issue. Perhaps as a result of this it will be possible to avoid building one or two nuclear power stations, because we will improve efficiency and energy saving.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by mentioning two points. The organisation of research at European level is an excellent idea and we are in favour of it. This could be the first sector in which the European Union does this. It is the start of a common energy market, in this area also, as well as the free movement of knowledge. In this report I proposed specific amounts of funding to support new technologies. This is essential if we want to help our industry, the energy sector, and if we want to make the Lisbon Strategy a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the ECON Committee reached our decision very coherently and by a large majority. Clearly, the emerging compromise on network unbundling is not to be seen in such ideological terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report places much greater emphasis on the question of how suitable the national approval procedures really are, realistically, when it comes to ensuring future progress in the field of cross-border networks, network development and network investment. We believe that there is still much catching-up to be done here and regret for example that in the position adopted in plenary very little emphasis has been placed on the need to accelerate the approval process at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">A second aspect that appears important to us is the question of the regulator. States would be very much more prepared to accept a regulator if the latter were given a large measure of independence. Contractual concerns have been voiced in this regard. However, looking at everything in regulatory terms it is only possible to argue in favour of a regulator if such an office would also have appropriate powers of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on this particular subject I would again express sincere thanks to my colleague Mr Buzek. We have been having an integrated discussion on the subject of energy policy and Mr Buzek has put forward some very constructive proposals as part of the SET-Plan. As rapporteur for CCS demonstration I too will be supporting this with solid funding proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">After such a heated and ideological debate I think that we should now give priority to the question of exactly what these concrete steps should be. This means that we now have a transition period in which we also have to examine whether the proposed measures actually work. To me this seems to be much more important than any ideology-laden discussion of network ownership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also feel that the consultation process carried out was extremely positive, and in our opinion this ought to continue subsequently.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret, however, that the SET-Plan focuses mainly on supply-orientated measures rather than measures to reduce energy demand, especially energy savings and energy efficiency, and we are calling for more attention to be paid to these two aspects. To this end, we would like a hierarchy to be created between EIIs, with efforts being focused on those with greater potential to reduce emissions in the short term, a reduction of 20% by 2020, obviously without neglecting measures in the longer term with a view to fulfilling the objectives set for 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to these priorities, we also feel that consideration should be taken of the life cycle of each technology and its environmental impact during the production process, and that transfer of these technologies to developing economies should be taken into consideration in order to reduce the technology gap with these countries. We also feel it is necessary to extend the EIIs to other sectors with significant emissions reduction potential such as cogeneration, hydrogen, the construction and housing sector, heating and cooling systems, and better energy storage and distribution infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we wish to say that we feel that funds for these technologies ought to be part of the debate on future financing of EU policies, and therefore the Member States should be required to make a greater effort, at least in the same proportion as they did in response to the energy crisis during the 1980s. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason I would just make one comment, for there is not enough time for anything more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has again just pointed out that in the Commission’s opinion ownership unbundling is somehow – to use his words – the most efficient solution. We doubt that, because it cannot be verified either empirically or theoretically; certainly not empirically, for there are plenty of examples to show that even after ownership unbundling undertakings do not operate so smoothly. Neither can it be verified theoretically. It is and remains a monopoly, a natural monopoly, and monopolies do not have much to do with free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">What therefore matters is not so much the question of ownership but rather of regulation. The sector has to be strictly regulated and this has to apply to unbundled network operators just as much as to non-unbundled network operators. We have made a number of proposals to this effect in the ECON Committee and we would hope that these proposals could also be taken on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our criterion has been to protect consumers and to approve socially appropriate and transparent measures to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add that this is a report which was not affected by antagonism or by any negative reactions and was adopted by the Parliamentary committees within which it was examined, unlike the rest of the energy package where the matter of ownership unbundling took centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">With more specific reference to consumers, our committee focused on matters relating to consumer protection and on proposals promoting and safeguarding a true European internal market in natural gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position on the promotion of effective regional cooperation among the Member States is a highly significant aspect of securing a true internal cross-border market. It is, therefore, necessary to create a European network of transport system administrators, where cooperation will be based on securing an efficient, representative and transparent European natural gas market.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I wish to highlight the fact that cooperation on transport systems does not require a separation of the network’s activities from production and supply. The transport network can easily become effective without any ownership unbundling in all the participating Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have argued that it is important for the European network of transport system administrators to hold talks with the bodies involved and especially with consumers and consumer associations, as these are important involved bodies in the extent to which they are also the end domestic users.</p>
<p class="contents">We have supported the transparency of information and of natural gas storage capabilities, so that fair prices and a truly open market will be sustained to their benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will keep it short. The market for energy has to be able to operate at European level mainly in order to guarantee the supply of energy to end-users at market prices. That is our aim. The unbundling is not an aim in itself but we think that this may be the way toward a functioning market. If the so-called third or fourth way, as proposed by the Council, can bring about a working market, then of course that is fine too.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in case that third or fourth way does not work, we have already produced a proposal in order to be ready with a possible alternative solution, which I hope will be carried tomorrow, for a ‘European network manager’ directed and controlled by the European Union. I hope that both the Commission and the Council can support this so that we will at least have an alternative ready in a few years’ time. In October, Mr President, we want to organise a round table discussion at which all stakeholders will be present and we hope that this idea will also be widely supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We did not always take the time that was needed for it. I would say this now here in this debate and at this particular time. I hope that it all does not catch up with us one day.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now seen again that in politics there is a real risk of staking everything on a cure-all and then railroading it through with all vigour while promising the people that this will solve all their problems. I hope that at the end of the day we really will find a solution to the problems facing us, namely how we acquire more investment and obtain more reasonable prices and how we achieve security of supply in the European energy sector. From morning to night we read in the newspapers and hear on the television about the cares and woes that all this is causing around the world. Is that the solution that we have been working towards all this time in these debates? I doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore thankful that we have made some headway on the gas directive, that we have moved a little further towards a compromise, that we have been more discriminating and have noticed that electricity and gas are different, that there is no longer a one-fits-all solution. It is good that we are now aiming for the third way and no longer just see unbundling as the number one option, and that we have managed to make a few amendments to much of what the Commission had proposed. Whether this is enough only time will tell.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that in June the Council demonstrated, through its new proposal, that even in such difficult situations we are able to rise above national boundaries and differences of opinion so as to come up with solutions. I would hope that what we have now agreed on gas will be revised slightly tomorrow and will move a bit closer to the compromise that has already been found in the Council. If we are to reach a swift settlement then we ultimately need to achieve a compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. I believe that what has been presented to us by the Council is very close to what we have now come up with for gas. Perhaps we should also take this as a benchmark for the electricity market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You must forgive me for focusing mainly on the report by my colleague Mr La Russa on the gas directive. There has been some very good collaboration between the rapporteur, Mr La Russa, and the various shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already discussed the issue of unbundling, network separation and gas supply. That is not one of the most important or central questions. I am satisfied with the compromise that we have found, even though it is very stringent, because on the one hand it still provides the option of not actually going for full separation, though this is subject to very strict conditions, while on the other the Commission can in any case use a review clause to apply quite a lot of pressure to ensure that competition exists and that competitive conditions are really maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we also need to take a slightly longer-term view of things. In this respect we would agree entirely with the basic views expressed by our colleague Mr Manders in the sense that we need to examine whether perhaps a common European infrastructure can satisfactorily be found. However, that is a possible alternative for the future and one that we cannot yet go into in any detail.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we should also have derogations, such as those that apply to any major investments where a lot of capital is involved and where we are still unable to say whether this will really lead to a solution, such as in the case of the Nabucco project. Here we also have to be sufficiently flexible. Investments of this kind are on a long-term basis and we do not exactly know when we will reach contract conclusion. That is especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a majority in this House will support our amendments tomorrow. Otherwise we shall be adopting the report as voted on in respect of transparency, consumer protection, energy and poverty. When I look at what the Commission and the Commission President last said on this subject it would be important if we had a clear declaration in this area, firstly on having transparent information for consumers, which is not always the case, secondly on setting up a help-line for network users, so that they too can request information, thirdly on an independent entry point for complaints, for there are always complaints – and each of us knows of such cases, even if we were not personally affected, which is also quite important – and fourthly on the protection of vulnerable customers, especially pensioners, the handicapped and others.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all real concerns, particularly in view of the rising energy prices. I do not understand that on the one hand the committee unfortunately did not take this on board, especially in the gas sector, and that on the other the conservatives and in the end President Barroso himself have been saying repeatedly that we have to strive to help the consumers and, more particularly, the more vulnerable customers. I do not wish to speculate whether this means subsidised rates or some other option. This would also be left to individual countries. The Member States should not always shift responsibility to the Commission but should also be prepared to take their own decisions. However, the European Commission and Parliament should be taking a lead by showing that such an option is possible and probably also beneficial if we are also to protect the social interests of consumers at a time of such high energy prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, the problem is the same as that referred to by the previous speaker with regard to the ‘islands’ in the European gas market – the Baltic States and Finland. I am not truly convinced by the agreement reached in the Council on 6 July inasmuch as existing owners, principally Gazprom and the companies associated with it, will not have to partition off their property rights until other connections emerge in these states. There is something of a chicken-and-egg situation here, since it is very likely that new connections will not emerge if it is not possible to come to a prior agreement and to be completely clear about access to existing networks. It is therefore possible that we will need to make use of some specific deadline here, with the introduction of an independent transmission operator in such monopoly situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to gas we have to distinguish between two markets. Firstly there is the fact that we have to bring gas to Europe. To do this we need a stable investment policy that also takes the gas supplier countries into consideration. For this we need long-term contracts and we must give European companies the opportunity to invest in pipelines in order to transport this gas to Europe. What we would need – and with a bit more effort from everyone, and particularly from the national governments – is a unified European policy on gas that allows the EU’s 27 voices to take the same line at international level. That is probably a better definition of what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">If Nord Stream is built we shall have gas at the crossing point in Greifswald and indeed everywhere else in Europe. Then we have the LNG market, which means the European gas market. The question that then arises is whether we are to draw up policies for the consumer or for the companies involved in this European gas market.</p>
<p class="contents">What does a company need in order to establish a cartel? The first thing is control over the pipelines so that competitors cannot gain access to their home market. The second is control over the gas storage facilities, so that while being readily able to cushion the supply a company does not then have difficulties when it comes to delivery. Thirdly there is market dominance: E.ON currently controls 60-70% of the German market while Gaz de France has a 70-80% share of the French market and there are no mechanisms in place to do anything about this. Fourthly, we have a weak European regulatory system, which means multinational concerns and national regulatory authorities that always end up coming second best. Then, fifthly, there is lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">What are Mr Reul and others proposing? Just these very things! In other words we are devising policies for the companies instead of for the consumers. This is why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance favour two basic approaches. We need to bring gas to Europe, but once this gas is inside the European single market there has to be competition: separation of the networks, better access to the storage facilities and a gas release programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear conservatives and liberals, you cannot any longer allow a situation in which we have 70%, 80% or 90% dominance on the national markets and the only weapon against this is gas release. We have tabled an amendment to re-introduce the gas release programme and we need it. Regarding point four, we of course require a European regulatory authority. This means that for the FDP and the CDU/CSU Members, as well as for the liberals and conservatives, tomorrow is the day of reckoning: either we make policy for the consumers or we make policy for the companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The majority of Parliament is calling for the separation or ‘unbundling’ of production and network ownership in connection with the liberalisation of the electricity markets. However, the Council has ridden roughshod over Parliament, and it is good that it has done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Unbundling of ownership does not by any means guarantee a reduction in consumer prices. Whatever happens with gas, the Member States will still have the option to unbundle ownership or to continue pretty much as they are doing at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction and maintenance of networks are not profitable business activities and this must be understood if the current owners are prepared to stop doing them. Company profits accrue through the pricing of electricity and gas, and the Commission’s proposal does not protect against this, nor does it protect consumers from energy poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In liberalising the markets, I would like to remind you again of the situation in the United States. According to calculations by the NGO Public Citizen, in the 14 states where the price of electricity is not regulated, it is 52 per cent higher than in the 36 states where it is regulated. Liberalisation, competition and unbundling of ownership will not automatically lead to a reduction in prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I challenge that, not least because almost all natural gas has to be imported. It places us in the hand of others, not all of whom are exactly friendly. Do I have to recall how Russia cut off the gas supply to Ukraine at Christmas time two years ago?</p>
<p class="contents">What about alternative indigenous resources? Western Europe is rich in coal, which needs only travel a short distance to a power station. Coal has a bad name, partly for pollution and partly for the extra carbon dioxide it produces per kilowatt as compared to gas.</p>
<p class="contents">But you are behind the times. Coal can be much more efficiently burned these days, releasing much less CO<span class="sub">2</span> than previous methods. Personally, I prefer not to see it burnt, but coked. Turning coal into coke produces two smoke-free sources: gas and coke, which when properly burnt together produce more energy than the coal they came from, in the ratio of 5:4. Moreover, by thoroughly scrubbing the gas, what are otherwise pollutants are removed. They are in fact the very same by-products we get from oil. And all that is under our feet.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, there is nuclear power for electricity. That too has a bad name on account of one admittedly serious incident at Chernobyl, but that was an old Soviet installation of poor design in the hands of operators who tried an unsupervised shut-down which went wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are there are doubts about nuclear energy, especially here in France, where nuclear power stations produce 70% of our electricity? Let it be noted that Finland, very environmentally conscious, has just approved a third nuclear plant.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, we have the spectacle of the EU promotion of biofuels which are now being severely questioned. Biofuels are either produced on new land produced by destroying the rainforests, or on converted existing farm land. The former produces more CO<span class="sub">2</span> than the biofuels save, while the latter is causing food shortages, especially in the less-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we need natural gas, not least for domestic use, but the thrust of these reports is for the supply of gas to the EU to be controlled by the EU itself, by way of regulation. Well, if it is anything like the CFP, where the regulations intended to conserve the fisheries have resulted in their near destruction, then heaven help us all. Without doubt, gas supply regulations will be a red-tape nightmare, just when the Commission has said it wants to cut all that down. How else will you produce a situation where the gas supply is split into two: transport and storage? Surely the most efficient system is for the storer then to supply – but no, you want to divide and increase the bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report suggests licences for the pipeline operators while at the other end smart meters will be installed so that the consumer can be closely monitored. By whom, exactly? Thus is state surveillance ratcheted upwards, while energy failure is to be a public order issue, giving the police powers of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from placing the consumer in the uncertain hands of unreliable regimes, these reports extend the power of the state over the individual. In short, it is all about control.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile it must be noted that earlier this very day, Parliament voted to approve investigation into the environmental impact of the proposed gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea. This is tantamount to approving a project to bring Russian natural gas direct to Germany, bypassing Poland, thus preserving their supplies and never mind the rest of us. Is that what they call solidarity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last we are deciding to separate ownership over the activity of generating natural gas from that of transporting it, or we are at least entrusting redistribution to a separate operator. This is quite rightly the thrust of the parliamentary amendment introducing the concept of independent transmission operator.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a welcome attempt to dismantle dangerous monopolies – as Mr Zīle said just now – and hence to settle conflicts of interest in the most effective manner: it is vital to do so in order to guarantee security of supply. Furthermore, a laudable attempt is being made to stem geo-economic and geopolitical interference by prohibiting third-country operators – albeit with waivers which I hope will be short-lived – from controlling the network of gas pipelines which are of strategic importance to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One merit of the La Russa report is this: if it is true, and it is true, that the purpose of the Community-wide internal gas market is to offer all EU consumers freedom to choose their supplier and at the same time to create new commercial opportunities, we must expect a more efficient service to be provided and then reflected in competitive pricing. The contribution to security of supply would also seem obvious. Lastly, another aspect worthy of note in view of its huge social importance is the strengthening of protection for users at national level: more vulnerable users and those living in disadvantaged or remote areas and regions. Such protection should be afforded thanks to preferential supply tariffs.</p>

<p class="contents">This House has always claimed that the reality of the gas market differs from the electricity market, since a sector that controls all its areas of activity from generation to end distribution is not the same as a sector subject to intense geopolitical pressure during the extraction and production phase that controls only transport and end sales.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why a large majority of the EP felt, and continues to feel, that we ought to consider another alternative to ownership unbundling for gas. To this end the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopted a compromise amendment to the La Russa report securing a position acceptable to the vast majority of Members, who see this as a credible alternative to ownership unbundling; an alternative that guarantees effective independence of the system operator, since only this can ensure more investment is forthcoming to increase the capacity, and this in turn removes the main barrier to newcomers and provides better and greater competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who support ownership unbundling have always said we could accept a credible alternative that would guarantee the same results. I think we have succeeded in drawing up a suitable plan with this gas compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are aware that certain people favour the alternative plan proposed by the Council, which does not support the trustee concept and intends to propose a separate vote. I wish to let it know that without this concept its alternative will not constitute a genuine alternative to ownership unbundling, but rather a legal formula allowing certain Member States to be more equal than others in terms of opening up their markets. Naturally this possibility does not seem so coherent.</p>

We are satisfied with the way in which we dealt with finance together, a common concern within such an important plan. We must also make some mention of human resources, not only because they must be increased, but because the Plan also involves other aspects such as training, mobility and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">One extremely important objective has been achieved in that a more significant role has been allocated to technologies that increase energy efficiency and to research in general, deploying the full potential of the European research area. The report enhances research and basic sciences that are essential for progress to be made in energy technology, and calls for the private sector to invest more in research and assume greater risks to make the EU a frontrunner in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements must also be made to technology transfer, a task to be undertaken by the new European Institute of Innovation and Technology, and there must be greater cooperation with the Member States and other Community instruments to bolster research, development and innovation capacities in those areas. Coordination has to extend to all fields which, owing to their multidisciplinary nature, play a part in energy technology research and development, especially information and communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to gas, it simply ought to be said that LNG facilities and their storage infrastructures, provided they have interconnections with transport networks, operate as complementary facilities which play an essential role by guaranteeing access to new operators and speeding up the creation of a genuine internal European market. It would thus seem logical to apply the same treatment in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, operating on the basis of the ‘one-stop shopping’ principle upheld by this House, a combined operator of independent infrastructures emerges as the most effective option. Using a single operator gives users access to gas infrastructures, since they will encounter similar contracts and codes, the same level of transparency and the chance to arrange services in groups.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission believes that Europe should lower the costs of clean energy and put industry at the forefront of the low-carbon technology sector. While I agree with these objectives, I would also say that the best intentions never become reality without proper financing. This is why I regret that the Commission did not publish the communication on financing for new low-carbon technologies. How does the Commission intend to finance these actions? In any case, let me assure you that Parliament will not accept the reallocation of funds from the Seventh Framework Programme or the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">This question of financing is also raised in regard to the 12 CCS projects. While I believe this technology might help industry to reduce CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions, I cannot accept that European taxpayers’ money be used to finance the development of a CCS infrastructure that will be someone’s business in the end.

We hear more and more calls for amicable, united, long-term cooperation and strategy while, at the same time, we are faced with examples of uncoordinated actions, partial proposals and investments that serve the interests of one party at the cost of others.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports that have been put forward are an attempt to deal with this problem or else to draw attention to issues and dilemmas that have not been sufficiently considered. The rapporteur deserves our praise for this. The world has never in its history seen an example of another commodity whose price has risen so much over such a short period, as have the prices of oil and gas. For this reason we can state clearly that mistakes were made in anticipating the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that this economic dilemma must be resolved by moving in two directions: first of all, by increasing the supply of energy sources, including newer and more efficient ones and, secondly, by slowing increase in demand using new, more economical technologies. The European Union must show itself to be more effective in this regard and cannot allow the privilege of monopoly access to raw materials or a majority shareholding to decide the situation in the market. For this reason access to gas distribution networks, research into new technologies and new agencies are useful suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is a time when we need urgent action and implementation. For this reason the threat to climatic stability posed by CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions should be analysed again by scientists to verify its accuracy, so that we do not find in the future that reductions in emissions only bring advantages to a selected few, these being, principally, large companies and not consumers, while at the same time destroying the coal sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What it said was that my country, Germany, was completely isolated when it comes to using nuclear power. I sometimes wonder how such reporting can be possible and whether people do not know how few countries around the world actually use nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">If you really look into it you will see that three quarters of all the world’s nuclear energy is produced in just six countries, while there are one or two others that have a marginal share of the nuclear power market. This means that on a global level nuclear energy has made little or no contribution to date. It only plays a role in part of Europe and in North America, where it figures largely.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many factors dictating whether this state of affairs will change or not, and one of these is how much public money is once more to be pumped into this dying industry. The US, which was so conspicuous in Hokkaido, has now – thanks to departing President Bush – pledged USD 18 million to promote two or three reactor projects. Nothing of this kind has been built there for twenty years and the nuclear industry needs a lot of public money in order to create a market artificially.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EUR 6 billion have been announced for the UK. This is what a reactor is said to cost there if the German company E.ON builds it. If we look around elsewhere we see that the Belene plant will be built for less, though Bulgaria wants EUR 600 million from Brussels to put the scheme into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We really have to decide whether in the years ahead we are to put public money into future technologies and new markets or whether we want to stick to technology from the last century that poses enormous risks. I am arguing for the future and against nuclear energy because I am convinced that the risks presented by this technology cannot be overcome. Today’s report of yet another accident at the Paks nuclear power station in Hungary simply reaffirms my opinion. Thank you all for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that now is the time for action and that European voters want us to adopt measures that would result in fair prices on the energy markets. The share of speculation today counts for 30% to 40% of the final price, and it would be good to introduce an energy price moratorium when the year-on-year increase is over 30%, as it is now. I think that people expect us to do this. It is clear that salvation is not to be found in the markets alone, and the old saying that ‘financiers support the state just as a rope supports a hanged man’ is confirmed. In my opinion, liberalisation will not help us in the present situation. What will help us is building new capacities (including the much condemned nuclear energy) and investments, massive investments in new technologies.

Do we really know what the energy needs of the European Union countries realistically will be over the next decades, and is this knowledge reflected in our regulations and directives? Do we really know what a stable European energy situation, as a whole, should be like? Are we able to identify clearly those countries that actively look for the solutions to their energy needs, and at the same time point the finger at the troublemakers who are just energy importers but at the same time unashamedly criticise energy producers and exporters? Have we become at least a bit more realistic, in the light of the latest World Bank study, about the Union’s nonsensical goals in the area of biofuels?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, no market functions if demand exceeds supply. It may happen to the Union pretty soon in the energy area. Consequently, we need to start supporting research and development and, most importantly, resolve all the links in the energy chain, such as production, transmission, distribution and consumption. As far as resources are concerned, whether we like it or not it is necessary to start building new facilities to replace the existing ones that are nearing the end of their lifespan in order to meet the growing energy demand. I believe that we have to start talking about an energy mix that will not discriminate against any source of energy, including nuclear energy, will respect the geographical and political maps of the owners of raw materials and will be based on modern scientific knowledge that can be used in practice, rather than on green dreams.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, of course I support the so-called third way, according to which Member States will retain their right to define freely the ownership relations between energy producers and transmission networks. I also welcome the boost given to the independence of competences and duties of the potential operators of the transmission networks. I believe that in this way we will manage to prevent increasing unilateral dependency on gas supplies from Russia, and at the same time invest in the distribution and security of natural gas supplies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also especially important not to exclude long-term contracts but rather to ensure that these are considered when planning for stable energy supplies to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be thinking about the production and supply conditions for the trans-European networks. By providing support and incentives on one hand we could, on the other, demand that unbundling, even ownership unbundling, serves as a basis for setting the production and supply conditions. There are countless models that could be used here to safeguard the future markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A key issue – and one that has already been discussed today – concerns the operation of nuclear power stations. It is high time that the European Commission plays an active role in this area by setting up an agency or regulator that would be responsible for the safety and security of nuclear power installations. This regulator should also have the authority to remove unsafe nuclear power stations from the network.</p>
<p class="contents">The French agency could serve as a model in this respect. France has provided us with an excellent example of how to set up an independent regulator. It would be useful if this French regulator were given a say in the activities of the regulators in the other 26 countries.

<p class="contents">However, not enough attention has been paid to customers and consumers, who are in a weak position; this applies to the poor and to those living in remote areas. I therefore ask you to support our proposed amendments. Secondly, it is good that a compromise has been reached with the Council, ensuring that the countries from which there is no pipeline to the other EU Member States will not end up implementing all the internal market rules because they are not participating in the internal markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A strategic energy technology programme really is needed, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fact that energy efficiency has been included. There has been inadequate funding for energy technology. This has led to supply and demand failing to coincide. The crisis that has occurred in all sectors of the energy industry has led to the industry, which has woken up to climate change, not obtaining the technology it needs quickly enough. Quite simply, there are not enough suppliers of components.</p>
<p class="contents">Waking up to the reality of climate change has shown how poorly prepared for it we are. However, the change in the attitudes of citizens is clear, and cooperation is now needed from the Community, the Union, its Member States and industry at the same time as we have to prevent developing economies from spoiling our living conditions by polluting them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve cooperation with the United States in the field of the environment and at the same time we must conclude an energy cooperation agreement with Russia. It is therefore important to consider consumers, industrial development and cooperation with the United States and Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives us a long-term view of the market and thus ensures that it operates in a more stable and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns the security of systems and, above all, the security of gas supply. Gas transmission networks are of even more strategic interest than electricity networks. The question of ownership is vital in relation to the configuration of the European model, characterised by high dependence on producing countries, which are outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I support the amendment in favour of the third option, which guarantees non-discriminatory network access. In addition to this, as it did for electricity, my group proposed creating a single European transmission system operator, which would preserve our strategic interests.

Many speculators have switched their investment strategies into the commodities market and this speculation has contributed to increasing pressure on oil prices in an upward spiral.

The liberal approach consists of treating gas and its supply as a good and a service just like any other, giving rise to uncontrolled competition and totally excessive dismantlement of integrated public service companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, prices rise, the services provided deteriorate and commercial and marketing spending shoots up to the detriment of research and development, and to the detriment of security. What is worse, it generates harmful competition among the various forms of energy, thereby encouraging short-term choices based on the sole criterion of maximum profit in the minimum amount of time.</p>
<p class="contents">That approach forms the basis for the reports presented to us. There is another approach, however, which consists of treating energy, gas and their supply as a public service that should be provided to all on the basis of equality and territorial adjustments. That would result in a real Europe of energy based on cooperation and the general interest. It would be built around a European energy agency that would coordinate and pool all the research efforts of the Member States and would guarantee equal access to energy for all citizens. It would be based on an economic interest grouping integrating European energy companies, both public and private.

<p class="contents">The essential condition and a necessary requirement for responding to these challenges is that the players operate on a transparent internal market and under uniform rules.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, a difference between the electrical energy sector and the gas sector. In the gas sector our dependency on imports is as high as 60% and, according to some estimates, by 2030 this dependency will be 80%. From Russia alone we import 40% of total gas imports, and some Member Countries import all their gas, which means their dependency on imports is 100%. For this very reason it is extremely important that we should take care to ensure that an integrated Europe is a competent and an equal partner to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">With liberalisation in the energy sector, we are introducing several independent protagonists. Given that in Europe securing a critical mass of well-trained labour is now already a considerable challenge, due to a further liberalisation will be even more difficult to secure experts in the future. This particularly applies to smaller Member States with relatively insubstantial power-generating undertakings. An additional challenge in this respect is to maintain the political responsibility for welfare within a country despite the changes on the European energy markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-trained labour force is also required in order to make use of the opportunities available within the SET programme. During the last four years alone we have adopted a number of mechanisms for the promotion of research and development in the energy sector. I therefore expect that the Commission will dedicate special attention to the harmonisation of various contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Slovenian Presidency has made considerable endeavours to promote the third market liberalisation package. I hope that the French Presidency will continue the work with the same conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Undoubtedly, there is quite a difference between the electricity and gas markets, and we should distinguish between them in our documents, as was rightfully done by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Alas, we have only a few gas suppliers, and if we do not do something to achieve maximum reduction in dependence, we will be vitally dependent on them, both now and, highly probably, in the future. Reducing our dependence is of the utmost importance and the documents under consideration will play a huge part in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us adopt a realistic outlook and choose the third way. It is necessary to consider the realities of the position of the Member States’ gas markets. For example, Lithuania, along with the rest of the Baltic States, relies on a single supplier, Gazprom, for its gas supply. There is no doubt that the Kremlin is prepared to maintain and increase its authority in the EU gas supply sector. No financial resources are being spared. Everyone has witnessed the level of lobbying with regard to the Nord Stream and other projects. This is not economics, it is politics, and quite aggressive at that.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way we can resist this dictatorship is through solidarity in our actions and the creation of a common EU energy system as well as by supporting and implementing the alternative and, of course, nuclear energy projects.

This is a time when the European Union ought to respond to the increase in gas prices through market liberalisation, which is the only instrument that accurately reflects the relationship between supply and demand. Unfortunately, it is still possible to see that the energy sector is in the grip of European energy companies that are integrated vertically and at state policy level. I would therefore like to express Parliament’s gratitude to the committee concerned for its endeavours to direct reform in the direction of market liberalisation. Mr Piebalgs is right, however, in saying that we must give the distribution of property rights a chance. The case for this is strengthened by the fact that seven EU Member States have in fact made this move. The Council has laid down exemptions from the directive for small, isolated gas markets. At any rate, Latvia, the state I represent in the European Parliament, cannot talk about complete isolation, since it has a common gas market shared with two other EU Member States and a gas storage facility that supplies the region. These are sufficient preconditions to create the elements of a market in the region. I therefore call upon you not to support the Council’s proposals in that direction, at least not for the three Baltic States, but to grant an exemption from the directive. They need to prepare for the integration of the EU gas market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To achieve this more rapidly, the supporters of the proposal are insisting on ownership unbundling of the networks, without any concern for energy security.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the acknowledged results of having liberalised the electricity market demonstrate that neither workers nor consumers benefit from liberalisation. On the contrary, this has reduced employment with rights and increased the prices paid by consumers. It is clear that the profits of economic groups in the electricity sector have increased, but that fuel poverty has also increased, in other words more people and families are struggling to access energy. We therefore regret that the same route is being taken with natural gas. Although these are different sectors, the economic and social consequences will be identical, hence the reason for our opposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also applies to the discussion about the next phase of our legislation regarding carbon dioxide emissions: how to share the burdens and how to develop a scheme of European emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to turn to the presidency and stress that, when we have debated here today and voted tomorrow on the second part of the energy package, it is of the utmost importance that the presidency start the discussions between Parliament and Council. There must be no delays, because we need to have these markets functioning with a new legislation in place. We can ask ourselves whether the European energy markets are functioning as well as they should. The answer is very easy: they are not.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a difference between the electricity market and the gas market. Electricity is dependent on a number of different sources of energy and different producers, while gas tends to be more dependent on distributors. That is why the difference in the legislation which we are talking about – namely that we have full ownership unbundling on electricity and this scheme that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy decided on in Parliament – is acceptable. But what is important is to ensure that this is discussed and negotiated as soon as possible. It is important to make sure that the legislation on gas allows for a separation between production and distribution that also gives real strength to the third-country clause of the energy package.</p>

I believe that just as we are on the brink of adopting this energy package we must keep in mind three challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the energy challenge or the climate challenge, which highlights the extent to which we must be mindful of the nature of gas as a resource and treat it in a very specific way. The second challenge is the one our fellow citizens are bringing to our attention: price. Their spending power is currently affected by the price of oil; they want to have access to a high-quality, reliable constant resource, and for their interests in particular to be protected. Then, of course, we have the challenge of companies and the challenge of employees. There are many fears at present: both among consumers as regards their access to energy, and among employees faced with the prospect of the dismantling of gas companies. That is why, Mr President, I believe that we must pay very close attention to all the solutions that are suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is important to talk about it, I will mention the issue of the third option. I would first of all like to thank my colleagues in the ITRE Committee, who in their wisdom adopted the Vidal-Quadras/Laperrouze compromise last month. I firmly believe that this consensual approach allowing each of our Member States to make the necessary improvements to their gas markets, in accordance with their traditions, will be a useful basis for discussion with the Council, and I would like to call on my colleagues to confirm that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, when prices are higher awareness of the delicate nature of climate change is heightened.

<p class="contents">I would first of all like to thank the European Commission and the Members for this interesting debate and for all the work that has been done on this ‘internal energy market’ package.</p>
<p class="contents">As several of you pointed out, the adoption of this package will have direct consequences on the lives of our fellow citizens. We are dealing with a topic that reflects the expectations of the people of Europe. In my view, the improvements our citizens expect can come from two angles. The first is the need for consistent rules and mechanisms throughout the European Union, to which this package will contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is a need for clarity and visibility for the actors in the market and consumers. As far as consumers are concerned, Annexes A to the directives must in particular be transposed by the Member States; they provide for better information, greater consideration of citizens’ concerns and, obviously, greater concern for the situation of vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The work is not complete, however. Consensus has yet to be reached on a number of points, notably the application of effective separation not only with regard to gas, since our positions there are already quite similar, but also with regard to electricity. The French Presidency will firm up the general framework adopted on 6 June at the Energy Council on 10 October. It will not be until that date that we have a consolidated position in the Council. In particular, we need to work on the third-country clause in order to take account of the Member States’ concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will then forward its common position to the European Parliament so that the ‘internal market’ package can be concluded before the end of the parliamentary term; that is our intention in any case. I hope that our joint efforts will be rewarded with a constructive spirit and a desire for compromise among all our institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two reports dealing with the market in natural gas are in favour of liberalising this market in Europe. The legislation offers an alternative to full ownership unbundling, using the ISO model. The positive features include, in particular, the duties of national authorities to include renewables in transmission networks, guidelines for third-party access, setting up tariffs for access to networks and imposing sanctions for discriminatory behaviour. The creation of the European network of transmission system operators for gas, i.e. the body active in the area of cooperation, and of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators is also valuable. These institutions are a precondition for creating a natural gas integrated market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should add that the advantages of market liberalisation can only bear fruit where a diversified supplier market already exists today, and that means most of the countries of Western European. In contrast, natural gas suppliers in most of the new Member States have almost a monopoly. Paradoxically, these countries may in the end suffer as a result of the liberalisation package because the proposed legislation will weaken the position of transmission operators who have contracts with producers with monopolies. The so-called third way is better suited to this economic relations model. I support market liberalisation, but when it comes to natural gas, in most of the new Member States we must first do away with the market monopolies and introduce more suppliers; only then can we proceed (for example) with ownership unbundling without any risks.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me say a few words about the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan. It is closely linked to energy consumption in the Union, to reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions, to Europe’s energy dependency. However, as the rapporteur points out, little attention is paid to economical production, co-generation or poly-generation, savings by end users and industrial energy efficiency, and the budget for the established goals is very small. Funds are also lacking when it comes to technology demonstration, for example carbon capture and storage. It would be nice if the sweeping European gestures and statements about energy research were accompanied by the corresponding budgetary sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the Commission has divided EU countries into the better ones, which can increase their emissions, and worse ones, which have to reduce them. These latter ones are, of course, principally the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. According to the Kyoto Protocol, the reference year for calculating emissions under the ETS should be 1990, not 2005, as has been imposed by the Commission. This would be more honest and show greater solidarity. Being a leader in the area of the questionable impact of emissions on climate change should not take place at the cost of poorer populations. Efficiency and energy reductions should, however, be priorities, while renewable energy should be a supplement rather than an alternative. In the medium term the future belongs to clean coal energy and, in the longer term, as is already clear, to nuclear energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have an import requirement which will rise to 65% in 2030. We have consumers who cannot choose what kind of energy they are to have and who are hit by increasing energy prices and the effects of greenhouse gases and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Paparizov report, which we are debating today, concludes that there is a need for increased cooperation between system operators and for increased investment in the gas market. That is fine, but it is not enough. The Buzek report covering research and innovation concludes that we invest far too little. I would remind you that Parliament also wanted to increase investment in research and that we are soon to embark on new budget negotiations. The La Russa report covers the unbundling of monopolies and improving the functioning of the gas market. Those who are against this think that it would give rise to higher energy prices if ownership and distribution monopolies were broken up. So I have to ask the following question: when we have increased energy prices and the effect of climate change, are we going to solve the problem by more monopolies? Absolutely not! The outcome of the votes in committee has yielded something of what we need, but we still have many steps to take before we get a functionally efficient and environmentally friendly energy market in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This pressing challenge requires a new definition of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan based on two redefined pillars: ensuring better, cleaner production with regard to CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions through innovative technologies; and using less by decreasing energy use in all its forms and by promoting all the solutions. This basic good sense is unfortunately not sufficiently recognised in our major policies and measures to reduce energy use are not given adequate support in the SET-Plan or in the EU’s major structural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial element is the urgent need to increase both the human and financial resources needed to actually achieve our European goals. When will we at last provide a concrete response to the crucial demand, the formidable challenge represented by climate change? We are lagging behind when it comes to financing research on low-carbon technologies. To use Aristotle’s words again, Mr President, if we begin to provide extensive funding for research into these technologies, we will already have won half the battle in this new world.

The gas market should be considered separately from the electricity market because of the European Union’s considerable dependence on imports. Ownership unbundling could be an extremely useful instrument for guaranteeing the creation of a unified gas market in the European Union and for the creation of real competition in the EU energy market and, in practice, could lead to a reduction, or at least a stabilisation, of energy prices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also be cautious. The liberalisation process requires concrete structural changes, for which not all European Union countries are prepared. Market liberalisation and ownership unbundling just in Poland, without this happening throughout all the main energy producers in the EU, could give West European firms an advantage over Poland.

Today energy is almost synonymous with foreign policy and tends to relegate even climate change to a secondary position. It is evident that the current situation has caught Europe off-guard. Our national energy systems are parochial, monopolistic, complicated and obscure. Consequently the tendency to try to manage current challenges individually is irresistible. Thus efforts to create a single integrated energy market are increasingly resisted and Europe’s objective to reduce its dependency on foreign supply sources becomes almost unreachable. Equally, attempting to integrate new solutions in old frameworks would only make our task even more difficult. Therefore Europe urgently needs to overhaul the current arrangements, push decisively for a single energy market and start investing massively in research on alternative sources of energy. For Europe this is simply a matter of survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy policy must take into consideration the fact that there are significant differences in the potential of different countries to diversify sources of imported gas. There are different capabilities for obtaining and purchasing this raw material. I have often pointed out that it is vital to prepare a united energy policy that will guarantee energy security to individual Member States. Measures aimed at ownership unbundling in the natural gas market will certainly improve competition and the quality of services supplied. However, because of the considerable differences in gas and energy markets I would be in favour of the rapporteur’s proposal that these sectors be regulated separately. The gas market will only really be competitive when customers have full access to information on the amount of natural gas they are using and the possibility to change suppliers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one hand renewable energies have a major role to play here, while on the other natural gas does of course provide competition for renewables. I believe that this very competition gives us an opportunity to push prices in the right direction and by supporting this with efficiency measures we can also achieve a corresponding price reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper energy distribution in Europe is set to play an ever-greater role in the years to come and our small and medium-sized undertakings in particular will have an increasing contribution to make towards energy efficiency, because building refurbishment and the restoration of older properties naturally plays an important part in all this and there will also be an appreciable level of competition for the supply of gas to the household market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Buzek, Mr La Russa and Mr Paparizov, for developing such a type of consensus. We know that we are looking for secure, sustainable and affordable energy supplies and at the same time we also now realise that the change in the energy sector came a bit earlier than everybody anticipated. That requires us to take much faster action and to be more determined.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention one particular synergy that I have seen and that is very relevant. Yesterday I visited the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, not very far from Strasbourg, in Stuttgart. They have a research project on how to increase the efficiency of energy supply, combining the cycle of gas turbines and fuel cells, so in a way trying to rely on existing energy sources and increasing their efficiency with new technology. They are advancing reasonably well but there are a lot of technical challenges. To really move ahead we need more support for such a type of project. But, at the same time, we also understand that, if there is no competition in the market, these projects will always stay in laboratories. So we need to act in both ways to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">For the internal market package, I believe that now, after the vote, it is very necessary for all three institutions to move ahead rapidly to wrap this thing up and go on to the implementation stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to really doing everything to find a fast compromise in the second reading and to get the package agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the strategic energy review: it is at the start of the process. The technology plan is only the starting point. We will still need a lot of measures to really move ahead. One of the measures that I have promised to my colleagues and also here in Parliament is a communication on the financing of low-carbon energy sources, but this is not the only one. We believe that there are a lot of other measures needed if we are to really move ahead. Very wise words were said at the time of the first oil crisis. We do not have too much oil but we have ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – at least this is my opinion and it was said in the debate – we really need to use the ideas that we have. We do not have too much oil left in the soil in the European Union. </p>

It is clear that gas is not a market in which there is free competition; 90% of contracts are long-term, so it is very important to have strong rules and not to solve the problems by a single unbundling model. That was said in this Chamber and I think this was a good message for the next stage of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What was very important was the support for my proposals on the 10-year plan, on the development of regional initiatives that will become the basis for a common market: we should not be ideological; as many of our colleagues have said, we should be pragmatic and develop a transparent market with a clear set of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What was said in the debate about the role of the different participants in the markets was also very important. It is true that ENTSOG, the new body, may develop a lot of technical codes, but it is also true that the Agency, based on the national regulators’ initiatives and on their experience, could develop very important principles for the development of these codes, and together with the Commission ensure that this market is regulated by rules that will be applied by all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not be very happy to over-develop the control mechanisms within the different companies, so I believe the compromise that has been developed in the Council would be a basis that could be applicable both to gas and electricity and could open the way to speedier resolution of the Third Energy Package, because it contains a lot of new improvements both for consumers and concerning transparency. It would be a pity to postpone, for purely ideological reasons, this package, which is very important and much needed for the development of our energy independence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A large number of colleagues have spoken, and it would take at least one more working day to reply to each one. Our timetable does not allow for that. There has in addition been a good deal of – too much – praise and flattery expressed towards me: I trust it will not unduly go to my head.

<p class="contents">I should therefore like to express particular gratitude to my colleagues, Mr Manders, Mr Swoboda and Mr Reul, Commissioner Pibelgas of course and also Mr Vidal-Quadras. Thank you all. I think our work during this period has been absolutely transparent and cooperative, trying to consult everyone and involve everyone in the directive. I do believe that we have achieved clarity and transparency. On a few occasions I did perhaps ask certain colleagues to divest themselves of the mantle of national parliamentarian, in other words to cast off their partisan allegiances, so as to function a little more as Members of this House at the service of all EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to conclude by allaying the fears of Mr Zīle, who raised the problem of Gazprom and Russia. We are of course well aware that this is an extremely serious issue which has to be addressed, explored and resolved very carefully and above all very thoroughly.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to give an example. The same companies receive enormous incentives from citizens’ taxes for renewables. There are also commercial renewable installations and companies are doing business – nothing else – and I very strongly support these incentives for renewables. If you really want to solve the climate change problem on our planet we must solve the CCS question because we do not know the true answer for that. So from that point of view, as in the case of renewables, we should also have incentives for the first movers on CCS.</p>

At present there are a number of energy centres in Europe, each of which is managed by national regulators. It is natural that national governments wish to ensure a supply of cheap energy for themselves, as well as jobs in a sector that they treat as a priority. However, in this way, divided by national selfishness, we are losing in Gazprom’s European energy offensive. An integrated European market and a united front in the face of suppliers from outside the EU would make sure that we had energy security even before we diversified energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the EU’s failure to create a free-flowing and competitive energy market is, without doubt, being exploited by Russia. Opening the European internal gas market to competition will lead to greater efficiency and a strengthening of consumer rights as well as national regulators. The creation of a kind of system of connected tanks will make it easier to react if there is a crisis of energy supply for individual Member States and this will make the risk of energy blackmail less likely.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop the expansion of Russian companies in Europe and force Russia to respect mutuality in the treatment of investments in the energy sector.</p>

This is no different in the gas sector. For this very reason, it may be regarded as an important step forward that the European Parliament will shortly adopt the report on the gas market. We feel that the document prepared by the European Commission is an appropriate first step in the direction of more effective regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legislative package may contribute to the creation of real competition on the European market. There is only a great need for this because the Member States are largely at the mercy of external suppliers. With regard to imports of natural gas, Europe already has 50% dependency, and this may grow further in the decades to come. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the defencelessness of some Member States even exceeds this severe level. For example, Hungary depends on a single supplier, Russia, for 80%. The new regulation will not do away with this dependency at a stroke, but nonetheless it will create more transparent relations. It will promote more vigorous competition and reduce the burden on consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel it is an important step forward that the proposed legislation will reinforce the consumer protection measures that are already in force. This is particularly important if we know that rising energy prices have become one of the most significant causes of poverty. We hope that the new regulation will make it possible for consumers not to have to face unbearable prices in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present the natural gas market is dominated by large concerns, which often control both gas production and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">An efficient internal energy market is important for realising the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and for ensuring approachable prices for energy consumers. During this debate we should not, however, forget about energy security, which must be guaranteed through diversification of the supplies of imported raw materials for energy.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that the energy market is the same in every area. The natural gas market differs significantly from the electricity market and, for this reason, it is not possible for the regulations resulting from the work on the regulations for the electricity sector to be transposed to the natural gas sector.</p>
<p class="contents">A real liberalisation of the natural gas market sector should be based on ownership unbundling of transmission system operators. Only in this way can we avoid unnecessary conflicts of interest and fair and non-discriminatory access to the network. For fair competition in the common energy market, investors from third countries should be subject to the same criteria as regards ownership unbundling and independence as companies in Member States, which is something on which we should put very considerable emphasis.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European market will soon be an open market with an effective separation of the activities relating to energy production and supply on the one hand and network operation on the other, thereby ensuring greater market transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They relate to the very significant supply constraints, which make it necessary to guarantee long-term contracts with supplier countries, but also to the particularly high cost of investment in transmission and distribution networks, which must offer consumers the highest level of security. Consequently, the political challenge here is clearly to stimulate investment and innovation, to promote our knowledge and skills, and to ensure that our supplies are secure.</p>
<p class="contents">By focusing its proposal on ownership unbundling, the European Commission, in line with its obsession with competition, did not in any way respond to these challenges. Its text destabilised a specific strategic market: we are hugely dependent on foreign imports and companies with which we should be able to negotiate from a strong position, rather than a position weakened by prospects of industrial dismantling.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting the amendment on effective and efficient separation of activities, as a possible alternative to full ownership unbundling, we should be able to achieve a more balanced and, above all, proportionate text. It is therefore important to support this position, which will reinforce the excellent work also done on investment, system access and system operation. In that way, security and competition will be able to sit side by side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title36"></a><a name="creitem36"></a>

I hope, Mr Verheugen, that you will be able to report back to Commissioner Charlie McCreevy on the nature of our debate.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time we have had active sovereign wealth funds in Europe, primarily the Norwegian fund, and yet until now none of the actions of this fund had posed us any problem. Two new events have shaken up the current situation, however. The first is the constitution of important reserves by oil monarchies and countries that have accumulated trade surpluses that feed these sovereign wealth funds. The second event is of course the subprime crisis, which has shed light on the strategic role these sovereign wealth funds could play.</p>
<p class="contents">Previously, when these funds were used to invest here and there, particularly in the United States, their strategic character was called into question. Now, when we look at the role taken over by sovereign wealth funds from investment banks in terms of injecting liquidity or own funds, we realise that they have instead become investors of last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">In these conditions, emotions come into play, and that is why we wanted to ask this question. It is also undoubtedly why, unlike the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, the President of the Commission himself felt it useful and necessary to publish on 27 February a document that forms the basis of our discussions today.</p>
<p class="contents">We run the risk of seeing a strategy being implemented in each of the Member States that, at the end of the day, would not help to tackle the reality, which is that sovereign wealth funds have today assumed a responsibility, an active role in the capital market. As a result, this new situation to some extent places obligations on them and on us in the dialogue we wish to hold with the managers of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we would like to raise five questions today.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are of the impression that the Commission’s response up until now has been to say: ‘Let each Member State implement its own strategy, in terms of the transparency and governance requirements relating to these funds, and at Community level we will simply verify whether the requirements in each Member State infringe the rules of the Treaty or the rules on the functioning of the internal market’.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not seem to us to be the correct strategy. In our opinion, in a case like this we should instead be working towards a proactive approach and establishing coordination at Community level: on the one hand to prevent unfair competition among Member States – for it is clear that there is to some extent a race between the Member States to see who can benefit most from the sure, long-term investment capacities of these sovereign wealth funds – and, on the other hand, to define and work together on strategic or sensitive sectors that need to be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question relates to the problem of the registration of these funds. Would it be possible to envisage at Community level registering these funds, just as we are currently considering doing for rating agencies?</p>
<p class="contents">The third question concerns the interpretation of Article 58, which provides for restrictions on the free movement of capital on grounds of public order. As far as the Council and the Commission are concerned today, is there one interpretation that should take precedence in this area? We would like further details on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question is as follows: is this not a debate that has an international dimension? In our opinion, the European Union would be much better equipped and better prepared to tackle the international dimension of this debate if we had to some extent defined the position of our base camp, the position of the European Union, rather than the position of one Member State or another that might have rushed into this race, attracted by the financial possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The last question relates to the exchange rate. What is your view on the situation where the oil monarchies are currently investing in euro assets with funds from oil sales in dollars, thereby aggravating the tense exchange rate situation, with the resulting repercussions on our trade balances?</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Mr Vice-President, those are the questions the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to ask and we look forward to the responses from the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add a number of other reasons why they are being discussed. Of course, they have taken off in recent years: according to the IMF, they generate between EUR 2 200 billion and EUR 300 000 billion today. However, we also need to look at their investment strategies, their transparency, the clarity of these strategies and, possibly, the emergence of new funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In October 2007 the finance ministers of the G8 countries asked the IMF and the OECD to look into these issues. In response to these invitations both institutions got to work: the IMF focused on the countries responsible for the sovereign wealth funds while the OECD concentrated on the recipient countries. The IMF examined the funds’ current practices, organised a round table focusing primarily on these topics and set up an international working group composed of 25 countries that possess such funds with a view to drawing up a report, which is due to be published at the end of October of this year. The aim is to draw up best practices, which sovereign wealth funds would be free to adopt, particularly as regards transparency, investment strategies and governance. It should be noted in this respect that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund has been highlighted by many as the reference in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the OECD is concerned, emphasis has been placed on best practices for the recipient countries, and the OECD ministers adopted a declaration a few weeks ago. The work will now continue in the Investment Committee, which will focus in particular on peer monitoring of policy development and hold a wider debate on the investments controlled by foreign governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to the Community dimension. As you know, in February 2008 the Commission presented a communication entitled ‘A common European approach to Sovereign Wealth Funds’. In its communication the Commission notes that new legislative measures at Community level are unnecessary, but it advocates a common European approach based on cooperation between the countries receiving the sovereign wealth funds, the funds themselves and those responsible for them, with a view to establishing, and I quote, ‘a set of principles ensuring the transparency, predictability and accountability of SWFs’ investments’.</p>
<p class="contents">The common approach recommended by the Commission should be based on five principles: commitment to an open investment environment, support of multilateral work, use of existing instruments, respect of EC Treaty obligations and international commitments, and finally, proportionality and transparency. It is important to note that the Commission communication is recommending the common European approach as a complement to the prerogatives of Member States regarding the use of their national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 March the Council examined this communication and submitted a report to the Spring European Council. The latter took over the ideas set out by the Commission, clarifying two principles in particular. On the one hand, rather than expressing its support for the multilateral approach in general, it preferred to express its position specifically on the work under way in the IMF and the OECD, which I have just mentioned. On the other hand, rather than referring to the use of the existing instruments, and once again taking a more general approach, the Council thought it more appropriate to adopt as a basic principle the use of national instruments and EU instruments, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">So as not to leave anything out, it is important to note, too, that the question of sovereign wealth funds was discussed at the meeting of the Transatlantic Economic Council, with which Commissioner Verheugen is very familiar, held in Washington on 9 November 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as national initiatives are concerned, it is true that certain Member States have already taken some or plan to do so. This also applies to other countries that are major recipients of sovereign wealth funds outside the European Union. Of course, such national measures should not contradict the common European approach advocated by the Commission on the basis of the principles I have just mentioned and supported by the European Council. The national measures must be envisaged in the context of a common European approach, which they should complement. I believe that that this corresponds to the concerns expressed by Mrs Berès.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination of the national measures is one of the cornerstones of the common European approach proposed by the Commission. As you suggest, an analysis of the existing initiatives in the Member States will quite probably be necessary in order to establish effectively such coordination and ensure that it does not encroach upon national prerogatives and competences in terms of protection. This analysis of European practices could take its lead from the results of the peer monitoring that will be carried out by the OECD Investment Committee, as I said just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 58, which you mentioned, Mrs Berès, it stipulates that the Member States have the right to put in place restrictions on grounds of public order or public security. However, as far as the Council is aware, this article has never been invoked in the context of sovereign wealth funds. In terms of the need to clarify this provision, I will simply point out that the Lisbon Treaty did not amend it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Council wishes to look at the European Union’s role in the international bodies. The Commission communication clearly demonstrates that we are actively participating and will continue to participate in the work of the IMF, the OECD and other bodies. As sovereign wealth funds have an international scope, it is clearly important for Europe to cooperate with the other recipient countries, on the one hand, and with the sovereign wealth funds and those responsible for them, on the other. The Union should thus play an active role in ensuring that the work in the multilateral bodies I mentioned moves forward, rather than simply following the discussions like a silent observer. That is why the Spring European Council supported the ideas put forward by the Commission. In particular, it explicitly set out its support for the current work to obtain an international agreement on a code of best practice, which the sovereign wealth funds would be free to adopt and which would set out the principles applicable to the recipient countries at international level. The European Council also added that the Union should endeavour to contribute to the current debate in a coordinated manner and it invited the Commission and the Council to continue the work in that direction. The Council fully intends to continue along that path.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your final question concerning the link to oil-related financial issues, as stated today in the G8 we are all aware of the importance of the issues involved in reducing the global imbalances. Certain emerging countries, notably oil-exporting countries, have large surpluses. It is crucial that adjustments be made, particularly through adequate currency appreciation. These questions are naturally being very closely monitored in the G7-G8, but also by the IMF with, of course, the participation of the EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its aforementioned February communication the European Commission has therefore set out how, in our opinion, Europe should respond to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">At its spring meeting the European Council unreservedly endorsed the approach being proposed by the Commission. The situation as it stands is simple: the European Union is the world’s largest exporter of direct investments and at the same time also attracts a lot of investment capital in the opposite direction. This is all very welcome. Investment and openness are two of the main driving forces for growth and employment in Europe. We cannot step back from our commitment to provide an open environment for investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Sovereign wealth funds did not just arrive on the investment scene yesterday but have in fact been investing in Europe for about 50 years. These responsible and reliable investors have pursued a long-term, stable policy that, moreover, has certainly stood the test during the recent turmoil in the financial markets. These funds have provided capital just when it was most desperately needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do we at this time have any grounds for assuming that sovereign wealth funds are having a negative impact on exchange rates. There are no real indications that such funds are switching from US dollars to euros and, moreover, their order of magnitude is not yet on a level that would enable them to have a significant effect on developments in the international money markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The number and size of these funds is currently growing rapidly. Investment patterns are changing. Even the geopolitical map of those countries that are setting up these funds is changing. The scope and the quality of the information that the funds are making available to the market tend to differ enormously from fund to fund and hence the fear that the investment of these monies could give the foreign governments concerned excessive political influence, and that is a concern that we have to take seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">If the funds are transparent and comply with clear rules of accountability then the fact that they are State-owned investment vehicles should not give cause for concern. What we need is confidence in the purely commercial nature of their objectives, which means that transparency and corporate governance are the key factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication from the Commission sets out some of the options that are available. Regulation is scarcely the best response. All investors in the single market should have to observe the same regulations as they apply to competition, the internal market and employment law. The various instruments on foreign investments that Member States adopt in order to protect public security, law and order must abide by Community guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mrs Berès, I would like to point out that Member States are entitled to adopt such measures and indeed most have been doing that for some time. The Commission will monitor this closely, though there are as yet no plans to carry out a detailed audit. Any review of investments in sensitive sectors at EU level also has to examine all investment sources, not just sovereign wealth funds. We are certainly in agreement that there are other types of fund that give more cause for concern than sovereign wealth funds and here it is not so easy to talk about transparency and corporate governance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly correct to say that we cannot tackle a global issue by adopting a narrow European approach, but rather we need to seek an international and global solution. The Commission believes that the best answer would be a code of conduct that would be developed jointly at a global level by the recipient countries and by the funds themselves. A voluntary code of conduct that lays down basic standards for governance and transparency would ensure greater clarity in the functioning of the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Council meeting in March signalled its support for this approach the European Commission has been actively involved in the work of the IMF and OECD on the definition of best practices. Progress is being made in both these organisations. I can certainly say that a solution is now beginning to take shape and we have a well-defined and integrated European approach that we are now pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that this is a bilateral process. It is in everyone’s interest to achieve clarity. For the funds themselves, this will mean stability and reduce the risk of setbacks. For those national economies in which the funds are investing, a stable, predictable and non-discriminatory framework will eliminate the risk of these important investors voting with their feet, in other words leaving Europe and investing elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to take the work of the IMF and OECD further. We have a strong consensus within the Union and this means we have a common approach. Member States have not opted to go it alone. In fact not one single Member State wishes to play a lone hand. This strengthens our argument and it is important that we maintain this whatever happens. With this kind of support we can expect our policies to carry a lot of weight and the Commission is confident that by the end of this year we will have concrete results of a positive nature to report to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are the trend of the 21st century and this debate is very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">These funds have become more visible again in a time of financial crisis involving multiple banks and investment firms as they stepped in to provide much-needed capital injections to some of these firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Sovereign wealth funds are predicted to grow at an increased rate in the near future, which should not scare us. This is a natural part of market development. The capital that sovereign wealth funds bring to the global market is needed to keep investment flowing. They have the capacity to provide liquidity to the financial market and to companies. This is sometimes vital to their survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to their size and resources, sovereign wealth funds are able to invest where funds are sometimes desperately needed but where others cannot or will not invest.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, like any other investment funds, also SWFs seek good yields from sound investment which moreover tends to be long-term. They do not a priori pose a threat to global financial markets or the European economy; rather they are very beneficial to it.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is some concern today with the rising economic power of some oil-rich countries as well as countries such as China and the implications of this, the response to this unease should not be the exclusion of these countries from global financial and investment markets. On the contrary, Europe should welcome the inflow of funds coming from these states and their investment funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally the fact that some of these countries are not abiding by the same basic principles with us politically is a cause for some concern. If political objectives drive their investment strategies – however, this has not been the case – there is no evidence that sovereign wealth funds would have caused any major crisis. They have operated in a sound manner without political interference. It is both counter-productive and against the principles of good regulation to discriminate against all SWFs based on their origins.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle of financial markets and corporate governance regulations should be the same treatment of all actors involved in similar activities. Of course the code of conduct would be welcome but it should be based on this undifferentiation of the source of income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sovereign wealth funds have been around for a long time. In the current context of serious economic problems, as has been said, their capitalisation potential and the interest in this potential have increased. The opening up of strategic sectors and the assignment of essential public assets to private initiative is another characteristic of the European Union. However, it is important to guarantee that all operators, and sovereign wealth funds in particular, are guided by clear and transparent rules and that their objectives are compatible with the proper functioning of the markets, with fair competition between operators and with both short and long-term protection of the rights of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Commission’s commitment to a multilateral code of conduct, under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund. However, as is happening with hedge funds and private equities, a code of good practice is not enough. We would ask the Commission for an independent and much stronger guarantee that, in the internal market, the principles of transparency and governance will be duly respected by all financial operators, including these funds, based on European and not solely national or international criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many believe that this involvement is just the first step and that sovereign wealth funds are now lining up for a massive shopping spree that will end with many companies in Europe and possibly elsewhere too coming under their influence or even under their control. Here the fear of political influence is mingled with the anxiety that at the very least an attempt might be made to gain access to technologies that would otherwise not be accessible, especially since we are now dealing with partners and market players that have not previously been active on the international stage, namely sovereign wealth funds from Russia and China.</p>
<p class="contents">The money is certainly there. With more than USD 3 billion to hand these operations have now twice as much under their charge as the international hedge funds. However, from a historical viewpoint it has to be said that there is no evidence to support this assumption. The funds – as has already been pointed out – have so far always proved to be good shareholders. They are interested in the long-term, positive development of their business and hence in obtaining a good, long-term rate of return on their investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless we should not be wide-eyed and naive as we watch these events develop. We need a set of rules, but we do not want to have isolationism or protectionism, for sovereign wealth funds are, after all, an example of the fact that the free capital market is working and it is in our interest that this remains so.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals therefore support the Commission in its approach and in its call for a code of conduct and we hope that such a code will really bring transparency, that the basic motives for the investment of these sovereign wealth funds become clear and that the funds themselves apply good corporate governance and stick to it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need an EU-wide solution – not 27 different EU solutions – and we need an international solution too. I therefore welcome what the Commissioner has said, namely that intensive talks are now under way with the OECD and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years the free movement of capital has contributed to growth in Europe and in the world at large. We must not endanger this in the future through overregulation and protectionism but rather should abide by our free market principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The funds in sovereign wealth funds have increased enormously in recent years in, for instance, China, Russia and the Arab states.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of sovereign wealth funds is to invest surplus state reserves to yield profits. These countries may well, I think, be entitled to seek the best way to invest their reserves in foreign currency, so I take a positive view on the contribution of these funds. The funds improve the liquidity of the financial markets and create growth and jobs. They also contribute to investment for the longer term. They create stability for the companies they invest in. We should, therefore, continue to allow them the scope to invest. These funds can, however, bring threats along with them too. We will have to look at the type of investments they are making and whether they meet the requirements for transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still not complete clarity about the political involvement in these sovereign wealth funds. The disadvantage of this lack of transparency is that it can result in growing uneasiness on our part about these sovereign wealth funds. The Commission should, therefore, take action and that is a good thing. Otherwise countries will deal with these sovereign wealth funds at a national level. I am against too much national policy on this. Europe is the right level to respond to this and we should have a common response.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to have a coordinated position at European level. I am pleased, therefore, with the response of the Council and the Commission to collaborate closely at the level of the IMF and the OECD. I look forward to seeing the guidelines that the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD develop and I hope that they will incorporate transparency, good governance and reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to reciprocity, I take the view that we should confine ourselves to the sovereign wealth funds. We always want private investors, but we can require reciprocity from sovereign wealth funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They can also lead to problems and distortions.

We must prevent conflicts of interest, and the paradox whereby European sectors whose efficiency was entrusted to market logic again become a matter of public discretion; this time, however, it is the discretion of third countries.

One of the problems of state-owned funds is their enormous growth. Since February this year alone, their assets have risen by 600 billion dollars to approximately 4 trillion dollars, i.e. 4000 billion dollars. What power! This, combined with the fact that many of these funds do not have adequate transparency, which has been mentioned, as regards their investment practice and that some of them originate in non-democratic countries, I think indicates that we should be interested.</p>
<p class="contents">The funds are needed, the investment is needed, but we need rules of play and regulatory systems applicable to all, under which transparency must be exemplary. The Norwegian Oil Fund is, I think, an example which has been mentioned in this debate. It should also serve as a model when the code of conduct is drawn up.

I must, however, point out that the first time I heard of sovereign wealth funds was the 1993 ‘KIO scandal’ in Spain, which, according to the Kuwaiti authorities of the time, caused more economic damage than Saddam Hussein’s invasion in 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Other names have emerged since then. We have already talked about Gazprom, Chinese activity in Africa and Venezuela’s use of the funds to export the Bolivarian revolution, and we will be talking more today as a result of the financial crisis. Many companies are being bought up or receiving financial assistance through these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Kauppi said on behalf of my group, it is true that the funds have some unquestionable advantages: they help improve allocation of resources, they inject liquidity and reduce volatility, and these are all very useful at this particular juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the concerns aroused by the funds have also been mentioned: more extensive government intervention in economies, intervention that may occasionally be dictated by political rather than economic objectives – which can lead to market distortions and threats to national security – and the national reaction of each government, which could further fragment the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">To paraphrase Lenin, what is to be done? Obviously we must continue to investigate how these funds operate and produce an accurate diagnosis of their workings, and the Community framework must be reviewed. It is true that they are subject to rules on competence and investor protection, but is this sufficient? We must also come up with a voluntary code of conduct to guarantee transparency, predictability and accountability. Finally, the code of conduct ought to be exported to the international framework.</p>

This is because they often do not have a long-term-oriented focus, whereas sovereign wealth funds, together with pension funds, often have this long-term orientation and can strengthen the role of minority shareholders, as well as having a positive role in providing the market with liquidity.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is that they are often not transparent enough in their investment strategy and intentions, and I hope that the Commission will focus on this. The Committee on Legal Affairs recently adopted a report in this Parliament on the transparency of institutional investors, and there we asked the Commission to come up with a directive guaranteeing common standards of transparency.

The capital held in sovereign wealth funds now totals well over USD 3 trillion, which is twice as much as that held in hedge funds: reason enough for us now to look into this whole business. So far we only know of a transparent Norwegian system that operates good governance. However, just like private venture capital, sovereign wealth funds can cover up exactly who the entrepreneur is.</p>
<p class="contents">Sovereign wealth funds can invest strategically and can grow rapidly. Transparency is therefore urgently required. Employee rights can be restricted and employment conditions altered as a result of corporate transfers that have been influenced by sovereign wealth funds. Transparency and due notification is therefore needed in this area.

Nevertheless, there was agreement on a number of political principles that should prevent us from being too naive.</p>

These contributions from Members will certainly help us to continue the work in the Council and in the Commission with a view to drawing up a code of conduct.

<p class="contents">Someone asked how this work is proceeding at international level. Let me just say that while the activities in the IMF and OECD are running in parallel they are not dealing with exactly the same themes. They could more be described as complementary. The Working Group in the International Monetary Fund, which meets monthly, is attempting to establish how the conduct of the sovereign wealth funds themselves can be influenced in the ways that we have been discussing. The OECD Working Group, on the other hand, is seeking to determine how we ourselves should behave in response to the influence exerted by sovereign wealth funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is being tackled from two sides and once again I can say that the progress made to date has been satisfactory.

<p class="contents">However, the Council also laid down certain preconditions: the target must be achieved in a cost-efficient manner; the biofuels must be produced sustainably; second-generation biofuels must become commercially available; and the Fuel Quality Directive must be amended accordingly to allow for adequate levels of blending.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Mr Crowley, the Council had invited the Commission to present the necessary proposals as soon as possible. In January 2008 the Commission thus adopted a proposal for a directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. This would oblige each Member State to ensure that at least 10% of all transport fuel comes from renewable sources by 2010, as you know, and this obligation would apply not only to biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions on the Commission proposal are still ongoing in the Council’s preparatory bodies and in Parliament’s competent committees. The 10% target is of course an important element of these discussions, but we cannot draw any conclusions, other than to say that it appears that it will be difficult to meet the current target.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the increase in food prices, this is a complex phenomenon that has many deep-rooted causes and many consequences. The European Council of 19 and 20 June highlighted the importance of ensuring the sustainability of biofuel policies, for example by improving the production of first-generation biofuels and by encouraging the development of second-generation biofuels made from by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">It also underlined the need to rapidly assess possible impacts on agricultural products for food and to take action, if necessary, to address shortcomings. It agreed, too, that further assessment should also be made of the environmental and social consequences of the production and consumption of biofuels, both within the Union and outside the Union in the contacts it has with our international partners. We will therefore examine the Commission’s proposals very carefully from the point of view of both sustainability and the monitoring and evaluation arrangements. We know that Parliament is very conscious of these issues and we believe that we will be able to agree on rules that will allow us to enjoy the benefits of biofuels while minimising any harmful indirect effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, on the issue of biofuels – and the President-in-Office spoke of a first and second generation – the reality is that the problems that we now face in the linkage between biofuel production and food production are the result of using first-generation biofuels only. What we should be looking at is the third generation – going beyond the whole issue of biofuels to biomass, bioenergy and by-products from the whole energy sector – which could help us to achieve the reduction in our dependence on fossil fuels as well as assisting the environment. However, two key elements are required for that. Firstly, coordination of research and development of technology and, secondly, a flexibility within the guidelines as laid down by the Council meeting in January 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council’s conclusions of May of this year on both the Rights of the Child and the speeding up of the Millennium Development Goals are very welcome. However, in light of the Council’s recognition of the extreme vulnerability of children exploited for child labour, is the Council concerned with closing the gap between MDG 2 and the ILO Child Labour Conventions? MDG 2 only calls for states to provide universal primary education, while the ILO Conventions set the age of 15 – or 14 in some developing countries – as the threshold for child labour. This leaves children between the ages of 11 and 12 to 14 and 15 unprotected and uncatered for, especially in many developing countries where the resources and perhaps the will are not there to go further than MDG 2 and where children are most at risk from labour exploitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the international Conventions and the Millennium Development Goals are two approaches that are certainly different but are also complementary.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the aim of the Millennium Goals adopted in 2000 is to improve living conditions by 2015 through precise and concrete goals, of which you are aware; ensuring universal primary education is the second of these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these Millennium Goals, the international community has recognised education as a fundamental right and an important factor for economic development. Recognising the right to education is certainly one way of combating child labour, but it is not the only one: there is also the first Millennium Goal, namely poverty eradication in general, which is a decisive factor in the fight against child labour and increasing the number of young people attending school. The Conventions of the International Labour Organisation establish the legal framework for the fight against child labour and it can be seen clearly in both the Millennium Goals and the ILO’s protective Conventions that they complement one another, just as legislation and action or the general framework and legal application complement one another.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also an age gap in terms of the provisions of the Millennium Goals and the ILO’s binding legal provisions. The fact that this age gap exists, as Mr Aylward pointed out, does not in any way affect the Council’s determination to support the fight against all forms of child labour and the application of the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions that the Council adopted in May demonstrate that the European Union will endeavour to use the instruments at its disposal to act and to use the political dialogue between the European Union, the Member States and third countries, be it via trade negotiations, development cooperation or action in international bodies, to ensure that these Conventions are applied everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions the Council emphasised the need for the negotiations carried out by the European Community and the agreements concluded by the European Union with third countries to promote the ratification of, and compliance with, the ILO Conventions on child labour and contribute to the elimination of all forms of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will strive to make the most of the development efforts in order to further strengthen partner countries’ own systems and capacities for delivering basic services without discrimination; the Council’s conclusions thus also make explicit reference to protection from violence and exploitation. They mention, too, the need for adequate vocational training and skills development schemes as well as opportunities for productive employment and decent work after reaching the minimum working age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain Member States have already introduced alert mechanisms that enable all public authorities and civil society to be mobilised in a very short space of time in order to search for and find the victim. This type of protection, which is effective at a national level, may, however, prove ineffective if you only need to cross a border to get away from the warning or have enough time before it is triggered.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007 the European Commission initiated a reflection on this issue with a view to identifying the existing provisions and examining the feasibility and value added of action at EU level, and a working group was set up for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time certain Member States, namely France, along with some other countries – the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg – organised on 12 June 2008 an exercise to trigger a cross-border abduction warning. Other Member States, such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Sweden, together with the Commission, participated in this exercise as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ryan’s concern is a priority for the French Presidency, which will continue the reflection in a pragmatic manner in order to step up the fight against child abductions and to demonstrate that the Union is closely involved in these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the exercise carried out between several Member States were presented to the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers that is ended today in Cannes, and Mrs Dati was in fact due to discuss this especially important topic with her colleagues. I think that it would be interesting to initiate a reflection on the best practices in this area that allow the existing mechanisms to be pooled in a network with a view to obtaining the most effective warning system. Of course the Council will keep Parliament informed of all initiatives that might be taken in the next six months on this particularly sensitive and important topic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More recently, in September 2007, the Commission presented to the Council and the European Parliament the results of this strategy and prospects for the future. In addition, as the honourable Member knows, the Green Paper on ‘Future relations between the EU and the Overseas Countries and Territories’ has just been published. The Commission has thus just launched a broad public consultation, which will pave the way for a new policy of partnership with the overseas countries and territories.</p>
<p class="contents">These territories have many things in common with the outermost regions, as you know: remoteness, isolation from EU territories, vulnerability, including to climate change, and of course all of the issues relating to transport, both air and sea, management of migratory flows, agricultural policy and maritime policy. All of these points are common to both the overseas territories and the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the situation in the world today, what we realised was that, in order to succeed, a coherent development policy needed to be part of a wider regional framework; hence the ‘wider neighbourhood’ action plan that was launched by the 2004 strategy in Seville, which seeks to strengthen the regional integration of the outermost regions in their geographical position, in other words with certain ACP African and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This perspective, this regional dimension, is also taken into account in the economic partnership agreements negotiated between the European Union and the ACP states with a view to ensuring greater regional integration of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of different instruments for that purpose, with which you are undoubtedly familiar. First and foremost, the financial instruments need to be better coordinated, be it the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, the ERDF or funds subject to cofinancing. We must strengthen the current maritime links between the outermost regions and their non-EU neighbours. It is also important to participate in Community research networks between these outermost regions, the overseas countries and territories and their neighbours so that they can participate in Community programmes. Finally, we need to adopt new guidelines in the area of migration, especially within the framework of the cooperation between the ACP states and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member Mr Ortega said, the implementation of the strategy for the outermost regions, whose objectives will also be taken into account in the review of the Regulation on the programme of options specifically relating to remoteness and insularity, is part of the Council’s work programme for the French, Czech and Swedish Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the French Presidency has a special interest in these issues: as proof of this, an important meeting on the island of Réunion, which began yesterday and will end on 11July, is focusing on the strategies that need to be put in place to combat climate change and the loss of biodiversity in these outermost regions and overseas countries and territories. We hope that that meeting, too, will manage to give fresh impetus to this policy, on which we place the utmost importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The outermost regions are part of the EU, a continental territory, and they are offering us a splendid opportunity.

<p class="contents">What I want to say to Mr Ortega in general is that, notwithstanding the difficulties linked to the delay in the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty under the French Presidency, we are going to try to genuinely add a new dimension to these policies and to ensure that their horizontal dimensions are reflected as far as possible in concrete actions.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Sri Lanka</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council will be aware of the escalating violence in Sri Lanka and the increasing likelihood of all-out civil war breaking out. Most recently, 11 people have died and more than 70 were injured in a bomb explosion on a packed commuter train, two more were killed in an explosion in the capital, Colombo, and the television reporter of Tamil origin, Paranirupasingam Devakumar, was fatally assaulted on his way home from work, the ninth journalist to be killed in Sri Lanka in the past two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will also be aware of Sri Lanka’s failed re-election bid to the UN Human Rights Council, a clear rejection by UN Members of a country which many consider to have abused its position on the Council, not to promote human rights, but rather to protect itself from international scrutiny based on widespread and documented evidence of human rights abuses perpetrated not only by the LTTE but also allegedly by the Government’s own security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this, does the Council not agree that the EU should be seen to be at the forefront of efforts to finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict? What approach is the Council considering taking to this end and how will this affect negotiations with Sri Lanka regarding entitlement to GSP Plus status (Generalised System of Preferences)? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the beginning of 2008 the European Union has actively stepped up its dialogue with the Sri Lankan Government. From 16 to 18 March a troika of senior officials visited Colombo, where it met four government ministers and other senior politicians. On 10 June a high-level delegation from the European Commission took part in the 17<span class="sup">th</span> meeting of the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission held in Colombo. Both visits provided an opportunity to discuss the European Union’s concerns regarding the current situation in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">During the EU troika’s visit to Sri Lanka, the Union reiterated its commitment to its role as Co-Chair of the Tokyo Process and to its provision of humanitarian aid. The European Union is Sri Lanka’s largest donor of aid, as you know. It emphasised, however, the importance of establishing a more favourable climate to allow the NGOs, United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross to work effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Sri Lanka currently benefits from considerable advantages under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, which forms part of the European Union’s generalised system of preferences. The rules of this arrangement stipulate that all countries that wish to continue to benefit from GSP Plus will have to apply for it again by October 2008. The conditions for granting this arrangement are based on economic vulnerability criteria and on the ratification and implementation of 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, the environment and governance principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, Sri Lanka also has to apply for the arrangement.</p>

You are well aware of all of this too, Mrs Doyle.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency also welcomes the progress made under the Slovenian Presidency. In this context, you are no doubt aware of the progress report presented by the outgoing presidency to the Council in June. From the debate based on that report it emerged that the Council supported the general architecture of the package. In addition, it was decided that some of the proposals concerning the review of the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme and the sharing of the effort in the sectors not covered by this scheme should be analysed in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the provisions on the fight against carbon leakage, the use of auction proceeds, the flexibility needed to achieve the national objectives and the increase from 20% to 30% will be have to be examined in detail, as will the specific situation of certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that it is going to be difficult to achieve all of these targets. We also know that the French Presidency will have to provide clarification on all these points, that there are very conflicting interests and that we still need to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the elements I just mentioned, notably the mechanisms for allocating auction allowances, the measures to prevent carbon leakage and the various flexibility mechanisms that are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we also know, Mrs Doyle, is that it is of course absolutely vital to have a political agreement for the Poznań Conference at the end of the year, but above all it is needed for the Copenhagen Conference. As far as our Presidency’s work is concerned, in the context of the institutions, which you know as much about as I do, and the legislative deadlines, in conjunction with your House we have to reach an agreement that is ambitious enough to put the Union in a strong position for its international negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009, and the legislative time we have for that is running out. That is undoubtedly the most difficult challenge we will have to tackle, Mrs Doyle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing some very technical matters this evening, but in my opinion they are ones which will make a much more significant contribution to building Europe than many of the speeches we address to one another on so many other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We may not have noticed, but there are now almost 700 000 wagons in Europe which are able to move from one country to another and can be used by one company rather than another; until now, however, they have been prevented from crossing borders with relative ease because we had not established common safety rules on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, by tackling two issues that complement the rules on interoperability and on the mutual recognition of rolling stock, already carried forward in January, we are eliminating other barriers, and doing so in such a way as to ensure that there is a harmonised system, not least from a safety point of view. With the regulation under discussion this evening, we are taking a second step forward: as well as extending the powers of the European Agency, we are giving it a crucial role in setting up the single railway signalling system, intended to replace no fewer than 23 existing systems in Europe. We are at last beginning to glimpse that single railway market envisaged by the first Treaty, back in 1957, but which has still not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for a directive on safety, our main concern was to devise a maintenance certification system for wagons, at the service not just of railway companies and companies managing the infrastructure, but also, perhaps, of a third party deciding to invest in a fleet of wagons. None of this would detract from the liability of railway companies for the use of that rolling stock when it is on the move.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed at length whether or not certification should be made voluntary rather than mandatory, and whether or not to confine ourselves to wagons rather than all other rolling stock. I believe that we came up with a good solution: the system will be mandatory and will cover wagons for the next two years; it will also cover other vehicles – passenger vehicles – within ten years or so. This system has been outlined, this road has been followed, and we will shortly arrive at our destination. The Agency regulation, I would emphasise, fully covers the European signalling system, making it possible to take a technological step forward and envisage the eventuality of eliminating other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We had two difficulties: how to ensure that technological innovation – which must be fostered and increased – does not jeopardise the timeframe required for investment in the transition to the new signalling system. It seems to me that a solution has been found here too: namely to adopt a version 2.3.0 of the current system and move ahead with that, bearing in mind that by 2012 we will have introduced the even more advanced, definitive system. For these reasons, having – it seems to me – ingeniously solved both problems, I believe we can recommend that the House vote in favour of the agreement reached at second reading, enabling us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our work and of our relations with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These measures seek to support the revitalisation of the rail sector by eliminating the obstacles to the movement of trains on European rail networks. The two texts that are the subject of this debate, the amendment of the Directive on railway safety and the amendment of the Regulation on the European Railway Agency, are part of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment of the Regulation establishing the European Railway Agency had two main objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first was to broaden the Agency’s competences so that it can play its role in implementing the new Interoperability Directive. It will have to identify the various national procedures and technical rules currently in force for the approval of locomotives. It will then have to draw up the list of equivalent rules and thus requirements that, once verified by a national safety authority, no longer need to be verified by the authorities of the other Member States that a locomotive may have to enter. This work will be carried out in conjunction with the networks of national safety authorities, which the Agency will have to coordinate. The Agency will also be responsible for preparing technical opinions at the request of the national safety authorities or the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, some of its tasks needed to be clarified, especially with the introduction of the ERTMS system, the Directive on the certification of train drivers, and the registers and databases the Agency will have to draw up. The Agency will in fact have to play a crucial role in the introduction of the ERTMS system, not only by laying down the specifications of this harmonised signalling system, but also by guaranteeing the technical compatibility of fixed equipment fitted with different versions.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, the Chairman of the committee, Mr Costa, for the work that is being done at second reading in order to reach an agreement with the Council. This result was obtained following several lengthy meetings and enormous efforts by all those involved. The results of the negotiations are still quite cautious: amendments to the two common positions that the Council had adopted on 3 March 2008, which the Commission can support completely.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I thank you for your work, Mr Costa. I am now very much looking forward to listening to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me begin by offering the rapporteur very warm thanks on behalf of my Group. Over the past weeks he has constantly fought about technical details and sought improvements. With the two amending directives that have now been agreed between the Council and Parliament we are improving rail safety and also have a chance to improve interoperability and advance towards our aim of actually shifting more freight from road to rail.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it most important that the new certification procedure, the mutual recognition of certification rules, will quite definitely reduce certification costs and, as a result, promote the Europe-wide use of rolling stock. At the same time, however – and that was one of the thorny issues for us and I thank the rapporteur for being so stubborn – we must ensure that the question of responsibility for wagon maintenance is resolved clearly and unambiguously. That is the only way we can expect our citizens to agree that wagons can be used across borders without extra controls and promote interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also in favour of the Agency endeavouring to make progress with the ERTMS system and I agree with the rapporteur that the best is the enemy of the good. If we change version too quickly, we will probably find nobody going for it. So we must proceed carefully and cautiously in promoting the ERTMS version.</p>
<p class="contents">We all love trains, especially historic trains. I am, therefore, glad that we have made it clear here that heritage and museum railways are exempt from all the technically difficult but generally necessary safety provisions. I hope our friends will hear and see us. We fully recognise the interests of museum railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Safety must always be our top priority, and those who are given the responsibility of running our railway infrastructure and its rolling stock must be properly trained and their qualifications recognised if we are to improve both the efficiency and safety of our railways. It is right that safety certification of freight wagons should enter a new phase with the introduction of a new system in 2010. It is also right that passenger vehicles should be covered, and, whilst that must be done in 10 years, those who oppose this must surely recognise the need for such a system</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the rapporteur in his assertion that none of this should hold back railway expansion. The whole industry in Europe, particularly in the area of rail freight, is haunted by the lack of vision that sometimes emanates from our infrastructure providers who latch on to any excuse to do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must expand our railways, both in infrastructure and rolling-stock terms, so that we can deliver an efficient, effective and sustainable railway network devoid of obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must thank our rapporteur and all the Members for their support of my amendments exempting heritage and tourist railways from this directive. Had they been forced to comply, the cost burden would have been crippling, putting at risk the preservation of that rich industrial heritage that these railways undoubtedly provide.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe lead the way in railway heritage and preservation, a fact often overlooked by the Commission – but, frankly, never overlooked by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the end of the 19th century, the railways, together with the postal services, were one of the main responsibilities of the State. Each country was responsible for its own railways.</p>
<p class="contents">In most countries the State had become the owner of the main or the only domestic railway company. The need for this arose because the original private companies were mainly geared up to making quick profits. They had not succeeded in guaranteeing the quality and continuity of the service. After they were taken over by the States, the infrastructure and frequency of service improved. The infrastructure belonged to the national railways and therefore to the State.</p>
<p class="contents">The running of passenger trains and freight trains was in the same hands, so coordination between passenger and freight transport, on the one hand, and maintenance, expansion and optimal use of the infrastructure, on the other hand, was good. There was no need for any separate bureaucratic state bodies to interfere. Almost everything, apart from the sleeper cars and restaurant cars in international trains travelling long distances, was regulated at national level. Besides, international cooperation was very good. International train travellers saw the railways as one large overarching European institution. At station ticket offices you could get hand-written tickets to anywhere in Europe and good information about services abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cross-border connections and connections over very long distances between countries which did not share a border were much more readily available than they are today. That system, which we might envy today, had four weaknesses, especially after electrification. Countries opted for different mains voltages and different types of electronic safety systems. Freight trains were impeded by controls, and having to uncouple and transfer freight at border stations. As public transport increasingly was operating at a loss due to the rise of the car, sections of track at the borders were thinned out and passengers had to pay an extra charge to cross the border. After the arrival of air travel, information and ticket sales for long international journeys were increasingly neglected.</p>
<p class="contents">Solely on points like these the European Union could deliver improvements. It has been a matter of great concern to my group for years that intervention by the European Union has not focused in the first place on these cross-border improvements but mainly on further liberalisation. To limit the damage caused by these changes, more bureaucratic supervision is again necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In a series of earlier decisions on the railways since 2001 certain <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> have been established. Based on this new reality my group is seeking the best possible outcome for the future. The outcomes proposed in second reading look relatively good. A number of considerations relating to subsidiarity, safety and the desire not to leave everything to agreements between the now privatised railway companies have led us to the position where, despite our earlier criticism, we will vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, however, we must create the many conditions we need to implement that. The same applies in particular to the railway, which is a highly environmentally-friendly means of transport. We have some serious technological catching up to do here if we want to make the systems interoperable and we need to take a range of measures to ensure that we really achieve an internal transport market.</p>
<p class="contents">After lengthy and detailed negotiations between Parliament and the Council, we have achieved a good result. So we should not badmouth it but should actually endorse it tomorrow by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do think some reservations are in order, especially on the subject of agencies. Our experience so far in Europe with agencies has been, to put it cautiously, less than perfect. We often began by allocating too few if any budget resources at the start-up of the agencies. Then problems arose and we kept having to compensate after the event. We had and still have the problem of incorporating too few if any political controls and finding that the agencies have taken on a life of their own, free of any political control or responsibility. We can only hope, and the Commissioner must ensure, that it will all be different this time. Nevertheless, we must still remain on our guard, especially when it comes to agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing here with a highly technical area that is far from popular. Nonetheless, when discussing the climate plan and the aim of reducing greenhouse gases, the issue of rail transport and transport other than road transport arises.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, we have done a lot of work over the last two parliamentary terms to open up the networks. However, there is still an obstacle to the opening-up of the networks that we absolutely have to remove: the absence of technical interoperability, which is caused by numerous elements, including the many different types of control-command systems, stock recognition – which we are discussing here – and, in particular, track gauge. I am from a region called Aquitaine, where we have to change the axles of trains that come from Spain to ensure a fluid flow of traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions, which appear to be eminently technical, are actually eminently political because they determine our transport policy and the political priority of the fight against greenhouse gases and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Both of these texts are extremely important. I would like to thank Paolo Costa for the new proposals he has put forward, notably on the mutual recognition obligation. There are several ways of hindering the opening of the European networks. The rail networks were built on very national or nationalist bases. One way of hindering it is to show little or no desire to achieve mutual recognition of stock. From now on, I hope that, thanks to the text that we are going to adopt, we will have European legislation that will allow us to do away with this obstacle, which has been particularly effective between France and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to echo what my colleague Mr Rack said about the Agency: I believe that it is extremely important to give the Agency the resources it needs for its development and perhaps its democratisation so that Parliament can be more involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both cases, whether it is the ERTMS in another report or this case, the European Railway Agency plays an important role. It seeks to achieve the free movement of wagons and locomotives, thereby improving the competitiveness of the railway system in comparison to other types of transport. This can help to improve the environment, which is suffering as a result of the unbearable burden placed on it by traffic; the amendments should therefore be supported.</p>

<p class="contents">The railways have a future in Europe but can only regain market share if they are in a position to compete. The number-one condition is to be able to cover distances of 300-400 kilometres, which is the distance over which they can beat competition from other modes. However, 400 kilometres in Europe means crossing borders. That is the crux of the matter: either we succeed in making our trains cross borders efficiently and quickly or we will have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago we devised rules enabling engine drivers to do just this; today we are doing the same for wagons. Very soon passenger locomotives and rolling stock will also be able to cross borders. They will do so indiscriminately, without any need for concern that interoperability may endanger safety. This is the ultimate goal we set ourselves, and I do believe that we are close to achieving it. We are laying down European timeframes and schedules – two years for wagons; ten years for other vehicles – but it will happen. Rolling stock will at last move around using a single signalling system. The idea we pursued until a few years ago, of making trains learn to recognise more than one signalling system, was another option, but clearly that option was thwarted by the existence of more than 20 different systems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If these two matters make sufficiently rapid headway, we will have made a real, major contribution to the eventual construction of the single railway market. That market, which our founding fathers had thought would be the first to be built, will in fact be the last. What matters, however, is that it does come into being, and in sufficient time for the railways to contribute to the fight against climate change and to overcoming the constraints imposed upon us by rising energy prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is of critical importance for the effective and economic functioning of the air services market within the harmonised and coordinated rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This Regulation replaces and combines three existing regulations: the Regulation on the licensing of air carriers and the leasing of aircraft, the Regulation on free access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes and the Regulation on the liberalisation of air fares.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation we have in front of us today is for the most part based on experience acquired in the course of the implementation of relevant existing regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament completed its first reading of this Regulation in July 2007. The Council adopted its common position on 18 April 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I, together with the shadow rapporteurs, arranged in-depth discussions with interested parties and institutions. Moreover, after first reading in Parliament, we had several meetings with representatives of the country holding the Presidency of the Council to ensure that the issues we were working on were reflected in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Having thoroughly analysed the common position, I can confirm that it corresponds to the political agreement adopted by the Council last December, which reflects the issues that concern us fairly well.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aim of achieving appropriate implementation of social rights, reference is made in the annex to the document, based on the position of both the Commission and the Council, that the Member States should ensure adequate application of employment rules and conditions, including the maximum employment term and minimum rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, as Parliament has stated, the transparency of air fares, including their presentation on the Internet, would be ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ aircraft lease agreements adopted by Parliament, as well as the position on restrictions on ‘wet’ aircraft leasing, have also been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also succeeded in achieving the position that distribution between air traffic routes should depend on direct communication between the airports concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has unreservedly accepted 29 of Parliament’s amendments and rejected 8, primarily because of technicalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can accept the Council common position. I do not think that any further amendments or a third reading would bring any significant results. We have achieved what we intended to achieve. Therefore, I would like to recommend that we accept the Council common position, as it has basically been influenced by Parliament’s first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This position was accepted by a majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Prompt adoption of this Regulation would enable the aviation sector to adapt to the upgraded legal environment because there would be only one regulation instead of three.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that these fundamental achievements would allow Members to support the common position without amendments and to vote in favour of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Its main aim is to simplify and consolidate the existing legislation. I believe that the agreement on the table, following Parliament’s first reading in July 2007 and the adoption of the Council’s common position in November, allows us to achieve the main objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it cleans up the text by deleting the obsolete sections on the transition to the liberalised markets. The text is clarified and three Regulations are consolidated into a single text.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it ensures effective and homogeneous application of the Community provisions by defining more precise and stricter criteria, for example as regards the granting and supervision of operating licences. It also tightens the monitoring of air carriers’ financial viability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it enhances the coordination among the Member States in relation to intra-Community services.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it improves passengers’ rights, which is very important: the right to full information on the actual price of a ticket, including taxes, charges and fees, and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality or residence when purchasing a ticket.</p>
<p class="contents">I must highlight passengers’ rights in particular because if we want to defend the European debates we must always remember that the citizens of Europe are the focus of our work. I am therefore very pleased to see the speed at which this issue is moving forward and I would once again like to highlight the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, and the Committee on Transport on this text, which has been significantly improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there are few differences of opinion between the two institutions, I hope that we will be able to adopt this new text very soon and that it will enter into force without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved good compromises and will support his report tomorrow. Consensus was soon reached on the broad lines of the aviation regulation we will be voting on tomorrow. As he said, that regulation takes us a big step forward towards reducing red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Three existing Regulations have been put together into a legislative text that is easy to understand. Thanks to this common position, existing EU legislation on air services has been brought in line with current practice. In addition to the licensing of airlines, the regulation covers technical questions and price transparency, which is the subject I want to address in particular on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset we urged putting an end at last to the misleading adverts offering absurdly low air fares. We want to introduce substantial simplifications for the consumer, which are long overdue. This EU regulation will bring an end to the advertising tricks and inducements that often confuse the consumer. Airlines may no longer con consumers by advertising flights – especially on the Internet – at ridiculous fares of, for instance, EUR 9.99, and then face them with large extras in the form of taxes and charges.</p>
<p class="contents">In future air fares are to be set out in a comprehensible and transparent way. The consumer must be able to identify what proportion of the price goes to the state and how much goes into the pockets of the airline and airport. That applies above all to Internet offers. That is why we have also called for price transparency. We will be happy to vote for the report tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are at last adopting the necessary update to the third liberalisation package. This recast text injects new clarity and efficiency, especially in regard to authorisation for placing in service, aircraft leasing, traffic distribution and air service safety. It also makes it clear that EU and national social legislation must be applied properly, regardless of the Member State in which the airline has its operational base. Nevertheless, the social and working conditions in European aviation remain a problem and need to be put back on the agenda. The text could not resolve the question of the insurance model in the event of airline bankruptcy either, because of its complexity. That is another task for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of rules on price transparency is a great success. In future, it will no longer be possible to con European citizens with tempting offers. All customers will now be able to see not just the final price but also the proportion of the cost that goes to the airline, airport and state. That is a major contribution to consumer protection.</p>

It shows how the institutions can work together in implementing amendments protecting passengers as well as consumers and the business community.</p>
<p class="contents">Air travel has changed dramatically in a very short period of time, benefiting passengers in a world that is becoming ever more globalised. The diversity of flights available today shows the enormous change in society as regards business practices and leisure. The increased competitiveness between airlines has resulted in more flights and cheaper flights for ordinary passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw how this happened overnight in my own country – Ireland – with the introduction of deregulation in the aviation industry and the birth of Ryanair. Constant competitiveness in the industry has led to a wider choice and cheaper flights. This, of course, has created employment and, in some cases, has improved regional economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it would be remiss for us do disregard the negative aspects of this large development in the aviation industry in Europe, which has led to certain social and safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Airline profits should not undermine passenger and staff safety or other social aspects. I commend the recommendations from both Parliament and Council on these aspects. More cooperation and understanding and a more effective market must exist between Member States for the air travel market to develop in a sustainable fashion. We have already seen how price transparency has benefited passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">Air transport will be in constant change as life and society changes. However, we must have a unified approach for all those developments to be sustainable and for them to benefit all who depend on the industry. I commend the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, for his work and I wholeheartedly welcome the cooperation of Parliament and Council. We will vote for this report here tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not totally agree with the previous speaker that Ryanair is the ideal example of how to deal with air traffic conditions.

<p class="contents">Apart from flight delays, the most complaints that I receive against airlines concern the way that they lure people with what appear to be low fares and conveniently tell them the true cost only at the very end of the process. Low-fare airlines have perfected this art over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, not only will the customers see the true price, but also the security taxes levied by national governments will have to be highlighted separately. This transparency has to be a good thing, and I hope it will end what has been over recent years an exercise in deceit by some airlines which try to con the travelling public into believing they are buying a very cheap ticket when the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also make mention of the report’s tightening of the ‘wet lease’ rules for aircraft outside the EU and its commitment to ensuring that social dumping is not acceptable when airlines lease in aircraft – again, something that has happened in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">There are concerns that the number of ‘wet leased’ aircraft from outside the EU is at an unacceptable level, compromising not only our social laws but also our safety laws and undermining our own EU civil aviation industry, and our rapporteur has addressed this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an excellent report for consumers, airline staff and European aviation. It is so good, in fact, that I am pretty sure airlines will already have started to look for any loopholes – again, another thing that has happened in the past and, again, another art that our airlines have perfected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, the commitment to improve the common rules for the operation of air services in the Community must cover some fundamental points: firstly, reinforcement of the financial fitness requirements for airlines, given the potential relationship between the financial soundness of carriers and safety; secondly, transparency in the setting of ticket prices with a clear indication, in addition to the basic cost, of the taxes, duties and other charges, and, finally, the unequivocal definition of public service obligations, including conditions resulting from specific constraints in the outermost regions and the need to safeguard competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes that we accept the Council common position. This means that, in addition to the points already mentioned, the main objectives identified by Parliament at first reading have been achieved. In effect, this text formulates and defines proper rules on the issues of operating licences, leasing of aircraft, public service obligations and traffic distribution rules, while reinforcing the internal market and passenger rights. It therefore gives the Commission the right to negotiate intra-Community traffic rights with third countries and reinforces the employment rights of those working in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore congratulate Mr Degutis on his work in this respect and support the acceptance of the Council common position without further amendment. Both arms of the legislative authority have worked to achieve an important agreement. Will the result help to overcome the crisis? I was pleased to hear the Commissioner’s response. Will this help to ensure a better and more effective internal market in aviation that will be of benefit to the economy and people? We hope so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly important today, in the age of the Internet, to provide greater price transparency in air fares and thereby prevent misleading offers, while also ensuring equal conditions of competition. That is the only way to achieve a minimum quality and, in the name of consumer protection, to protect people who have little or no experience in booking trips from being lured by misleading offers. In a sense, it is creating interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to observe social legislation is the second major point in the report and there is no doubt that Member States must ensure that both Community and national social provisions apply to airline employees if aircraft and their crew are leased out to cover peak season traffic or make up for the shortfalls of airline operators based in other countries. That responds to the needs of the airline operators, the needs of the employees and, in particular, the needs of the consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is far more than that though. I would like to endorse what has been said by fellow Members about the importance of transparency with regard to air ticket prices. That is a great step forwards. It has also always been an important demand from Parliament’s side. Let us be absolutely clear: we have nothing against low prices, but the consumer should in all transparency have a clear idea in advance of the cost of buying an air ticket, inclusive of all costs. The same applies for that matter to all manner of extra services and insurance that customers have to explicitly request. Consequently, Mr Degutis, I am assuming that your report will be able to count on a very great deal of support from Parliament tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Anyone who has ever booked flights on the Internet – and many of us do so – knows that problems may arise not just in relation to price transparency but also if you do not fill in some little detail of the booking correctly. In that event, it all backtracks and you end up with far more insurance than you actually wanted and not a cheap ticket but one at an over-inflated price as a result of extra charges and insurance. The airlines themselves should not be promoting this practice and the Commission in particular and we in Parliament should monitor such behaviour.

<p class="contents">We have discussed aviation on many occasions at this part-session. Today we want to make a reality of the Regulations from some 16 years ago on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community. These amendments should help to improve safety and – I would stress this – the quality of aviation services as well as passenger protection. Clear information on flight ticket pricing is a particularly important issue. It is good that we are also considering the issue of permits to ensure that operators are reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good that the rights of air crews have been debated here today. At this point in time, when there is an enormous growth in aviation, regulation is vital. It should not, however, hamper new initiatives and should be in passengers’ interests. We should also remember that flights start and end at airports, so a good service culture at airports is also essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament felt it had a duty and responsibility as co-legislator for future measures and as a budgetary power to state its position on this Green Paper in good time. We approached the subject confidently and carefully: confidently in the sense that we want to say where the European Parliament believes this road should take us, and carefully because we do not want to question the Commission’s right of initiative but will await its detailed proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">There was broad consensus on this subject during the discussions in the Committee on Transport. I want briefly to address a few important questions.</p>
<p class="contents">A key theme that rightly concerned many colleagues was subsidiarity. They asked who should be a player in this regard and whether it was a matter for Europe in the first place and felt that perhaps we should not get too carried in making decisions, and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our answer would be this: we are assuming that the presentation of this Green Paper followed by the action plan will not affect the existing delineation of areas of responsibility in Europe but that all the competent players, the European Union, the Member States and the regional and local authorities, will make use of their competences and, crucially, coordinate them sensibly among themselves. In that respect, we would like to see an integrated overall concept and to see urban decisions on what is in fact right and important for the individual municipalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is to ensure that transport matches people’s needs. We should not mislead European citizens in the European internal transport market. If there is a green zone in one town and another green zone in the next town, that should not mean they face a new world simply by crossing a local authority border. We expect European harmonisation here and we expect Europe to set out best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">A third issue is accompanying measures. We held a hearing at which mayors complained that they often receive instructions from Europe and then, when it comes to implementing them, find that the Member States have left them out in the cold or, to be more precise, left them without funds to implement those European measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to pay special attention to passengers with disabilities. In my view, and as I keep repeating, that also applies to men and women with small children. They do not have a very easy time on public transport or transport in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to send out messages in and to the industry in good time, urging it to develop better logistics and new technologies. Most importantly, we want to raise awareness among the people. They themselves must help to ensure that we really can achieve a healthy environment through the transport system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cramer will cycle, Mr Marinescu will go home on a new high-speed train, Mr Costa will use the vaporetto, Vice-President Tajani will travel by scooter in Rome and I like to travel on foot in my home town. If we do all those things, we will indeed bring about a small but not insignificant improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by thanking the two Commissioners who have considered this issue in depth here, Vice-President Jacques Barrot and Vice-President Antonio Tajani, who is now the Commissioner responsible. I thank the shadow rapporteurs who also worked on this report and the colleagues who helped bring about a good result in committee. Let me also thank my colleagues in the committee, in my group and in my own office for their work. I hope it will produce a further good result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful to him for his lively speech. I shall go and visit him so that next time, as he suggests, we can find an intermodal means of moving around our cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s work, picking up on a Commission initiative, has without doubt been positive, as has the debate, which has focused on three fundamental points: how can urban mobility best be improved in Europe, the added value of Community-level intervention and the redistribution of tasks between the various levels of government. The Commission’s Green Paper launched the process for engaging in European-level activities in the field of urban mobility and transport. It puts urban mobility at the heart of the European debate about the best means of ensuring mobility on a basis that is sustainable for society today and for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reasons behind our debate are concerns about climate change, congestion, the health effects especially of atmospheric pollution, security of energy supplies and road safety. The many amendments tabled during discussion of the draft report by members of the Committee on Transport, and the helpful contributions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Regional Development, show how strongly the European Parliament feels about urban mobility, a subject which affects the overwhelming majority of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the consultation on the Green Paper ended on 15 March and we received more than 400 contributions. The points of view of all concerned, and of course the proposals from the European institutions, will provide valuable input into the forthcoming action plan on urban mobility, which I intend to present this coming autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now come to the report. I liked the invitation contained in the text to develop a broad-based European urban mobility strategy and the acknowledgement that Community-level action offers clear added value in some spheres. The report identifies the main spheres of action in a structured, targeted and also very clear fashion, and so I would compliment Professor Rack once again. It analyses the EU’s role in various areas: legislation, standardisation and harmonisation, the exchange of best practice and research. In addition, it raises the need for coordination between authorities and an integrated approach, as well as the responsibility of individuals and the question of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome most of the ideas set out in the text, but I should like to dwell in particular on a few specific points among the many covered. I note, for example, that the report confirms the need for comparable data and the need to take account of urban mobility in other spheres of action where the European Union has legislative powers. In this regard, the proposed European platform bringing together data, best practices and policy information, in a manner that avoids red tape, undoubtedly deserves further attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree as to the importance of EU guidance on the standardisation and harmonisation of transport systems, especially for green zones and road pricing, if we wish to avoid piecemeal solutions developed in various European cities. My support also extends to the proposals on the social dimension, envisaged for specific groups, and to the proposals on improving education, training and awareness-raising campaigns, which could contribute to changing the behaviour of citizens. As far as financing is concerned, I agree with the report that, beyond making the best possible use of Community funds, new financial instruments also need to be devised.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the observation contained in the report: there is an urgent need for new thinking and innovative concepts on mobility in our cities. With all due respect for EU principles and legislation, we must promote and not hamper creativeness and flexibility at local, regional and national level. That is what subsidiarity is all about. Your valuable report makes an important contribution to European policy-making in this area: an area close to the hearts of citizens, businesses and politicians throughout Europe, most particularly local officials.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you once again for your attention and congratulations to the rapporteur on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the 80% of people who live in cities would adopt the recommended measures on the culture of urban mobility, life would become much better and healthier for everyone. This is a good example of the way in which the EU takes care of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to expand the public transport and bicycle route network and encourage the use of more environmentally friendly means of transport. However, the most important and most difficult task is to change people’s habits. For example, in Lithuania around 50% of all car journeys are less than a kilometre. Even young and healthy people forget they have legs and that the bicycle has already been invented. With the Commission’s help we should be able to find different financial levers to eliminate or reduce the traffic jams that paralyse the life of cities and their inhabitants. It is either movement, mobility, or suffocation among iron monsters, spitting out pollutants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this will serve as an example for future projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rack’s report considers important concepts in many different areas. These include, on the one hand, technical and organisational problems relating to the environment and, on the other, issues relating to social affairs as well as matters relating to area planning and town planning. This report also examined in depth the issue that Mr Rack spoke about, in other words the practical functioning of the subsidiarity principle. The report deals with an issue that is undoubtedly part of the competences of local authorities, but goes beyond their area of activity. According to the principle of subsidiarity, however, entities at another level should assist cities in this regard: this is what the principle of helpfulness involves. Entities at another level should give assistance to cities and they should also, first and foremost, help Member States and also the European Union by creating organisational and financial possibilities, financing pilot studies and experimental research.</p>
<p class="contents">This report touches on something that we know about in theory, but here we can see what an integrated approach means in practice. It is an approach that requires many different types of factors to work together. We look forward to further work by the European Commission on this subject and we are very keen to see the action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must always remember that when we talk about urban transport, so that we preserve and maintain that richness for the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, a little worried, after hearing the first speakers, that we will lose the balance that our rapporteur set out in his report between what can be decided locally, under the subsidiarity principle, and the little we can contribute here as a European Union. If that happened we would have uniform European towns and lose the richness of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put it quite plainly: local and regional authorities that have already tackled the problems of organising transport do not need the Green Paper, while local and regional authorities that have hitherto refused to address this issue will not be more likely to do so as a result of the Green Paper or our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise, however much we love going into details, that Europe will succeed only if its citizens accept it at local level. They will not accept it at local level if they feel that it is interfering in all areas of their local life. That is why I expressed strong criticism, in committee too. I very much regret that the Committee on Transport and Tourism did not accept my amendments in committee because I fear that in the end – starting of course with best practice, with Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund incentives – we are doing something we should really be keeping out of.</p>
<p class="contents">My request is, therefore, that we take the compromise now agreed in committee as the furthest we will go. Let us not go beyond that as a result of the many amendments that have now been tabled. Europe will not be successful if it interferes in every area of people’s lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have achieved a great deal together, I think. He knows that we wanted to be more ambitious on some points and that we wanted to sum up what the contribution of the European Union should be in more concrete terms. I understand that some members of his own group do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this report contains quite a lot of good elements and so gets full support from our group. To start with, it recognises that cities throughout Europe are facing the same challenges. There is congestion everywhere, and that is a problem that leads to a great deal of stress and wasted time everywhere. There are accidents everywhere. I think that half of the accidents in the European Union happen in urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We also all want to meet the ambitious climate targets that we have set ourselves. Most towns and cities also struggle to finance their infrastructure and the European Union can play a positive supporting role in all these areas, although – and I readily acknowledge this – the situation varies from place to place. However, we can learn from each other and so I think that the idea of a kind of observatory or platform for urban mobility, in which it will be possible to exchange good ideas, should be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Towns and cities should be encouraged or even required to put mobility plans on paper in order to bring all the interested parties together, get a consensus on a common approach and conclude positive agreements. We believe that the European Union should take on the role of director in the fields of harmonisation, standardisation, interoperability, and research and development to give new projects, including public transport projects, a better chance of success and to facilitate the dissemination of sustainable solutions throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in conclusion, we are counting on you to quickly come up with as concrete an action plan as possible with a clear division of responsibilities between the different policy levels, but a plan that will certainly include a major role for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With my colleagues in the URBAN-Housing Intergroup, especially Jan Olbrycht, who has just spoken, we invited Commissioner Barrot to discuss this subject with us last year. That debate was particularly lively, notably on the topic of the integrated approach. Commissioner, in the brief time I have available, I would like to highlight the benefits of looking at that very aspect in greater detail. There is a fundamental link between urban planning concepts and urban mobility. When I say ‘urban planning concepts’, I actually mean the absence of urban planning concepts. I will mention four elements to illustrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is clear that our urban areas are currently growing, whether they are small, large or medium-sized, with the appearance of commercial, industrial, housing and leisure sectors and zones. Every time new zones are developed, mobility develops. Need I remind you that our urban areas have grown by 11% in terms of their size, while their populations have grown by just 2.5%? That in 10 years, from 1990 to 2000, the expansion of urban areas was three times the size of Luxembourg? These figures demonstrate that every time an urban area grows, our journeys get longer, no matter where they take us. Finally, within these urban areas, in 10 years the number of daily trips in private cars increased by 70% and each individual trip increased by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures, these examples, clearly show that without a successful integrated approach that takes into consideration the different urban parameters, even with more efficient, safer, more intelligent vehicles, even with faster, more comfortable public transport, we will not totally resolve the problem of urban mobility and we will not resolve the problem facing our fellow citizens, who will always be forced to make an increasing number of longer, costly and unpleasant trips.</p>
<p class="contents">These urban planning concepts, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, must take account of urban transport not just in terms of the cities and towns, the urban territory, but also, as my colleague Mr Rack said, at a suburban level. There must be a degree of consistency for all of our citizens who work, relax, learn, etc. in this urban and suburban perimeter. However, the problem that arises, and this has just been mentioned, is how to enable the different administrative structures, the different districts and the other territories to coexist. That is why, Commissioner, we are asking you to give special consideration to the integrated approach in your future action plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I find it hard to say anything positive about the end result of this report. Europe’s towns are still left to stand on their own; they are not being helped. Instead of creating a concrete and helpful framework for urban areas in the 27 Member States, the majority of committee members opted for a superficial text: towns are to become greener, there will be less noise and a better quality of life! The report is as vague about how to achieve that as the EU Commission was in its Green Paper on urban mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rack offered us a sushi bar choice of menus for dealing with transport problems. At most, however, the report presents us with a list of added ingredients but no real recipe. There is an urgent need for action at EU level, however. Eight out of ten EU citizens live in towns and they nearly all suffer from the same problems: congestion, accidents, noise and pollution. Our towns also play a crucial role in the context of climate change. Urban traffic is responsible for around 40% of all CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and 70% of all greenhouse gases. The EU will not achieve its own climate protection target unless there is less traffic and people shift from cars to trains, buses, bicycles and walking.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions from traffic have in fact risen by 30% since 1999, while emissions from other sources have fallen by 10%. That means they have virtually swallowed up the achievements in other areas. Nevertheless, the majority of Members feel that even to quote these figures in the report as an indication of the link between urban traffic and climate change is a step too far.</p>
<p class="contents">At tomorrow’s vote, the Greens will table amendments in an attempt to inject the report on urban mobility with the substance it so urgently needs. Firstly, we want to adjust EU cofinancing to make it more environmentally friendly; specifically, according to our amendment, that means that we should allocate 40% to the railways and 10% to expanding cycling. Up until now, 60% of EU transport funds has gone to road projects, with only 20% going to local public transport and rail transport. No wonder, then, that we are achieving the opposite of what we keep saying we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we only want to grant EU funds if towns can submit a sustainable mobility plan, which would put paid to a great number of senseless road projects. Thirdly, we want to improve transport safety by setting a general speed limit of 30 km/hr, while allowing towns to set their own, higher speeds for certain roads.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to do more about the environment and climate protection and ensure safe transport, Europe’s towns will need substantial EU aid. They will only get that if our amendments are adopted. If they are rejected and if another report that does not resolve a single problem is adopted, the Greens will not vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Urban mobility is a complicated issue for policy preparation at European level. It is not easy to demarcate responsibilities and that can be seen in the report we are debating here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the report states in various places that the European Union has a role in the realisation of urban mobility plans, and then elsewhere in the report it states that urban mobility is a responsibility of the European cities and local authorities and, on the grounds of the subsidiarity principle, the European Union should only have a limited regulatory role. In short, weighing up responsibilities in this area is difficult. I do think though that the rapporteur, Mr Rack, has dealt with this issue well and has worded the text well with regard to the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of criticisms, however. Firstly, I think that the report has become too detailed. This creates the impression that it is possible to design a European framework that could be used to solve all the problems in all European cities. I understand the detailed list of topics to be considered for harmonisation and the list of areas for action and they are well intentioned, but I question whether we can take them much further. I think that a general approach would have been more practical. This would have put more emphasis on exchanging best practices and on technological developments in the area of urban mobility. I realise that this approach is less ambitious, but I think that we should remember that urban mobility is a matter for the European cities and local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the list of topics for harmonisation also contains some social norms. This does not seem a good idea to me. Social norms, such as the mobility of disadvantaged travellers, are very closely bound to individual Member States and so are better not harmonised or standardised.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these criticisms, I will vote for the report. The fact is that Mr Rack has succeeded in clearly emphasising in the report that a safe, sustainable and effective urban mobility structure is a matter for the cities and local authorities of Europe and I think that this is where the great merit of this report lies. The European Union can extend a helping hand by means of directed funding and the exchange of relevant information, but EU regulations are not needed in this area, nor are they desirable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that we should not lose sight in all this of the fact that the responsibility for urban transport systems remains with the towns and cities of Europe. They will have to develop systems and work effectively with all the relevant authorities. Finally, I would point out that the success of these transport systems stands or falls with citizen participation. They also have a responsibility to contribute to the goals of the urban mobility plans: sustainable, safe and reliable transport in urban areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the degree of urbanization in the Union has been continuously increasing. Over three hundred million citizens live in cities and the percentage of urban population will exceed 80% by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Urbanization and agglomeration have become a European problem because they affect the wellbeing of all European citizens. We are actually dealing with an increased demand for new and diversified means of transport, which causes an increase in the energy consumption, the degree of land use, and a progressive degradation of the air and soil quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are major differences at the level of national legislations, as regards the urban transport and the land use planning, the European Community institutions could get actively involved in coordinating the durable urban development and, first of all, the development of urban transport services and submit efforts to ensure the efficient dissemination of good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Our colleague Rack offers us eloquent examples of solutions provided both by modern technologies, such as virtual mobility, and by the consequent application of multimodality, optimization of the use of infrastructures, the use of alternative means of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and private initiative play an essential role for a Europe of green cities and the overall Community policies should take into consideration all long-term costs and provide pertinent suggestions, efficient interregional and cross-border cooperation mechanisms, as well as the necessary information resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The structural and cohesion funds, mainly the major cause of urbanization, by their appropriate use at local and regional level, should become the most efficient and available resource for solving this challenge that 21<span class="sup">st</span> century Europe is dealing with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the reservations and reticence expressed concerning the need to ensure that this kind of action is governed by the subsidiarity principle, I feel that not only do such proposals generate some important and necessary debates; they also provide a response to serious and pressing questions of national, regional and, above all, local governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing this issue today within the context of the major debate on measures to combat climate change in the run-up to the great debate on the globalisation of costs in the various means of transport. These debates are essential, but they must be reflected in practice in people’s daily lives in their surroundings, such as cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome this splendid effort by our institution in the report by Mr Rack. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his accurate remarks, and thank him for his willingness to include my amendments, thereby accepting, encouraging and enhancing a number of essential issues such as alternative healthier forms of urban mobility – walking, bicycles or public transport – and incentives for road safety, which, as has been pointed out here, shows its most harmful and aggressive side in urban environments. There must be consideration not only for persons with reduced mobility, but also for people with children in pushchairs, who are often neglected, as demonstrated by the urban obstacles crowding our pavements.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls for efficient goods transport, including reliable loading and unloading systems to facilitate last-mile operations, acknowledging the need to promote the co-existence of mobility of people and goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it supports improved use of intelligent transport systems, with requests for accessibility and interoperability alongside flexible instruments. Finally, it encourages active participation in local urban mobility forums. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing with a matter for which we have no competence. This Green Paper on urban mobility was based on an manufactured competence, as the Commission has admitted in private. I was told that because of the climate debate and because 80% of Europeans live in towns, the Commission has now declared itself competent in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Goodness me, I would be just as justified in saying that 80% of Europeans live in a family or once lived in a family. So let us now take family policy in hand. That would be an equally manufactured competence and impossible to justify. With regard to urban mobility, the only thing that can be promoted at European level is the exchange of good practice, nothing else. To adopt legislative measures here would equate to a breach of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We may assume that the local authorities themselves are keen to deal with their transport problems, because those problems are linked to the way the economy works and to internal, urban trade. At the same time it is, of course, a question of the quality of life of the town-dwellers, who might otherwise leave town. The problems facing our towns may be similar, but they simply are not identical. That is why we need local actors to take decisions tailored to their area. Urban transport policy must be decided and formulated locally and the local authorities must be in charge of planning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warn Members against calling for legislative measures in this report or possibly interpreting the text as including such measures after the event. I also warn against creating even more mountains of data and perhaps even more red tape. Establishing a European platform for urban mobility would certainly do that. No doubt we would then end up with yet another European agency, which would produce even more paper and, of course, also cost a good deal of money.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the way to set the citizens against Europe. We cannot afford that. I ask you to ensure that we do not end up with that situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many cities often do not realise that they can prevent problems concerning transport organisation through thorough planning of local road infrastructure. When deciding to visit European cities, tourists also take into account their accessibility and the way transport in them is organised. Traffic jams certainly do not make towns and their centres in any way attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no success without innovative solutions, such as easing the traffic burden, exploiting alternative means of transport such as cycling or carpooling. I believe that research and development offers considerable, as yet unexploited potential when it comes to new safer and environmentally-friendly means of transport and sustainable transport systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone must help to solve our transport problems: the EU, cities and their inhabitants, as well as tourists.

This new culture of urban mobility is a true revolution in terms of our way of thinking and travelling.</p>
<p class="contents">To paraphrase the famous saying by Sieyès on the Third Estate: ‘What is urban mobility in a city? Everything. What has it been hitherto? Nothing. What does it desire? To be something.’ In using these words, I am expressing my complete agreement with this revolution in our behaviour and the urgent need for an integrated and general European approach to this new urban mobility, with emphasis on the consistency of the major principles of successful urban planning. I also want to express my complete support for the eventual provision of a standard basis of solutions that allows a tailor-made set of measures to be drawn up for each territorial level.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, that implies that the Commission must assume its financial responsibilities and put its approach into practice. During one speech, our colleague mentioned this method, using the image of a ‘sushi bar’ where Europe would propose different dishes and the urban areas could then take them or leave them. This flexible approach must not skip a course: our cities. We need all the ingredients to be able to revolutionise urban mobility and establish this new culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I would like to take part in the debate on the report by Mr Rack on a new culture of urban mobility. As I have said before, I like cycling in Brussels and in Strasbourg, where I enjoy the safety of the cycle paths and I particularly the consideration shown by motorists, as if not just pedestrians but also cyclists have complete priority here. I am much more afraid at home, in Prague, where I see tourists barely managing to dodge the cars, and I prefer not to cycle at home anymore. A different culture is linked to a different tradition of rules of the road, where the stronger party was the winning party. I believe that increasing European mobility implies both harmonisation of the rules of the road in the Member States and a gradual convergence of traffic offence penalties. Different rules will sustain a different culture. Consequently, for the spoiled foreign cyclists and pedestrians (and I consider myself to be one of them), the roads in the new Member States present a huge risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say this to allay the fears of Mr Ferber, Mr Marinescu and Mrs Sommer: the Commission has no intention of taking the place of local, provincial or regional authorities. It is not up to Europe to determine local administrative policies, nor is it up to Europe to decide what to do in individual cities.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Subsidium</span> means helping: thus Europe, the European Commission, the European institutions can contribute to providing solutions, they can contribute to opening up a debate, they can contribute to an exchange of information between cities, with a view to finding solutions – common ones if possible – that may be of use to citizens, to facilitate their lives, their travel and their safety, be it on the roads or in terms of protecting their health against pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial contributions are of course a possibility. I would recall the Civitas programme, which achieved good results and may be an example worth following. In the action plan which I intend to put forward – whose purpose is to coordinate and propose ideas for action – I shall draw on all the suggestions that have come to the fore during today's debate, in an attempt to give ideas and suggestions, always in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, because I am well aware what powers the Union has. I do believe, however, that since the majority of EU citizens live in large cities, the European Union has a duty to help.</p>
<p class="contents">Helping – I repeat – does not mean replacing: I too am convinced that it is up to local authorities, elected by the people, to solve the people's problems. However, the European Union does have an important role to play, be it only helping and coordinating a few initiatives and disbursing some funds, in order that our citizens can be better governed by local authorities and their officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In that regard, the past 40 or 50 minutes have mirrored what happened in the Committee on Transport and Tourism over the past months. There, too, we saw fairly wide differences of opinion. We had to vote on more than 350 draft amendments. We managed to reduce those 350 draft amendments to a relatively consistent text, which was then adopted by a very large majority in committee, i.e. 27 in favour and 2 against.

In Europe, the economic growth in the 50s and 60s has led to the expansion of the horizontal city, whose population has left the city centre in favour of suburbia. This model, favoured by the proliferation of the use of automobiles, is no longer sustainable today, in the context of the unprecedented price increase for fuels and the concerns about climate change at a global level, changes mainly determined by the pollution caused by the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p class="contents">One should welcome the initiatives allowing European cities to plan efficient public transportation systems, which meet the environmental protection requirements and are accessible to everyone, as well as the integration into the urban planning of alternative means of transport valid for short distances or varying according to the time of the day. Another challenge is the urban goods transport, which is essential for the good economic development of the city. For this reason, I consider it to be important to implement practices such as experience exchanges between the administrations of European cities, urban optimisation databases at European level, as well as to encourage citizens to change the way in which they approach the issue of personal transportation in the urban environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title42"></a><a name="creitem42"></a>

Crash tests have shown that these belts, which are the devices most commonly used by European airlines, may actually endanger children and cause serious injuries.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are considering the EU OPS, i.e. the technical safety provisions, and they will soon enter into force, I was concerned to ensure that we resolve this safety problem, which is why I showed my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism the video on the subject. In my view, it is quite crucial to take a serious look at the crash tests that have been conducted and that have shown that these belts do not save a child in the event that take-off is aborted or a plane lands rapidly and to seek an immediate solution. I think that is extremely urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">The current, proposed rules will continue to authorise these belts, disregarding the fact that far more stringent safety provisions apply to children even in cars, in most European states at least. Even if emergency landings or aborted take-offs are very, very rare – for which we are most thankful and which is also to do with technical rules – we cannot allow infants and small children to be exposed to this risk. Anyone who has seen this crash test will be convinced that we cannot allow that.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues in the Committee on Transport looked into this issue with me and I am very grateful that they too took it very seriously. We want to find a good solution to this problem. A few safety experts have now objected that there is not a single known case of this kind of belt proving dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a macabre background to that.</p>
<p class="contents">If infants or children do not occupy a seat they are not recorded in the statistics. The underlying facts have been known for years. The German Ministry of Transport has drawn attention to this and said it did not want to go back to a lower safety level. The association of German airlines, however, described the listing of the risks as populism. I must say in all honesty that this can only be regarded as a cynical approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That raises several important questions. Which authority actually authorised this loop belt, this additional belt for small children? On what basis, according to what technical standards did it do so? I am aware that authorisation has been granted for an expanding belt for corpulent persons, but so far as I know there is no authorisation for the additional belt for children. Lap-holding, which some airlines offer as an alternative, is a very old method. It was first recorded when planes in the 1920s still took off at about 65km/h. We should not and cannot wait that long.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we can leave this decision to the Member States, because we face tough competition in the aviation sector and of course the pressure of that competition produces the risk that we do not create the best safety system. We need a European solution. I ask you: when will we have it? Is there any chance of seeing it today and is there any chance that we will find a sensible solution for the transitional period?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, millions were spent on ‘liquid on planes’ without serious debate. In the present case we must invest in the safety of children. We need to do so.</p>

It is a pleasure for me to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for having raised an issue that is highly topical and relates to the safety of our citizens. I said during the meeting I had with the Committee on Transport that the protection of our citizens' health is a priority, as are citizens’ rights, especially those of the smallest citizens who are unable to defend their own interests and are therefore dependent on us to try and protect their safety as best we can.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem you have raised is a very real one. Doubts abound, and the European Aviation Safety Agency itself is aware of a number of controversial studies according to which there are problems concerning child-restraint safety devices. That is why, faced with a set of contradictory and incomplete information, the Agency launched a study in 2007 to obtain a more reliable scientific response on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The current provisions – Regulation (EEC) No 3922/1991 requiring the use of child safety devices – leave Member States free to choose. In raising this matter, you ask for the European Union to give Member States a definite response, saying: ‘Beware, the system you are using does not work and does not guarantee child safety’.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific assessment will be completed by October 2008, just a few months from now. Therefore, as soon as a definite answer to the question of safety has been received – in other words, what the European Aviation Safety Agency regards scientifically as the safest means of guaranteeing that children can travel by air at reduced risk – it will be my duty to propose immediately the measures needed to improve child safety devices. I do know that the proposed solution, namely that of child safety seats, similar to those used in cars, is one of the options being examined by the European Aviation Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before giving an answer and before taking action – which I intend to do, because it is right to be concerned about the safety of our smallest citizens – I shall await the scientifically valid response from the European Aviation Safety Agency, which has so far demonstrated its ability to do good work and adhere to rigorously scientific criteria. Therefore, I repeat, as concerns the timing – you asked me for precise dates – the study by the Agency is scheduled for completion by October of this year; as soon as I receive feedback from the EASA, I shall see to it that I notify the parliamentary committee and I will intervene directly to give the Member States indications as to the best method of protecting children and guaranteeing their safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee certainly agreed on that, otherwise the question would not have arisen in committee. I am also grateful to the Commission for starting on the preliminary work a long time ago. Therefore, we are now joining a debate that the Commission has already prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three questions that I hope the Commissioner can answer. He said that the technical data will be available in October. The question is: when will the Commission draw conclusions from that data, during this term or later?</p>
<p class="contents">There are three very clear questions. The first concerns the best technical device for protecting children. The second question, once we have the answer to the first, is whether the European Union should work on a legislative basis or start by issuing recommendations. It is thus a question of whether to introduce binding European legislation. Then there is the question of whether we can manage to do that during this legislative term or whether we should start with recommendations and then move on to legislation. Then there is a third, thorny question, which is not raised in the oral question but that we and you must answer: who is to pay for it? That is a question that needs answering.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us assume, as Mrs Lichtenberger suggested, that the rules required every small child to occupy a child seat. If that were so, the child would be taking up an adult’s seat, which raises the question: should we force parents to pay for an extra seat for their small children, or should we charge the safety costs to the community, so that all the other passengers who are not accompanied by children have to contribute to the cost of the child seat? We must, therefore, also answer the question – assuming we are willing to equip planes for the safety of children – of who will pay for that safety protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, I want to thank Mrs Lichtenberger warmly for giving us access to the video showing crash tests of loop belts. I also want to thank the Commissioner for delivering an opinion that is very much in line with our question, although a few points remain to be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">These new requirements for the transportation by aeroplane of small children will be entering into force at the end of next week. Member States will then have the choice between child seats and loop belts. As we have seen, however, loop belts can be life-threatening. My first question is: when at the latest will the Commission present a proposal making it mandatory always to use child seats in aeroplanes? That follows the same line as Mr Jarzembowski’s question. My next question is: what is the Commission’s current implementing strategy? Will it present a regulation or how does it intend to implement whatever findings the survey may produce? Thirdly, if we continue to allow parts of the necessary EU OPS regulation to be adopted under the new comitology procedure, how can we be sure we can still get and consider a regulation on safe child seats during this legislative term? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is crucial to implement the strategy in good time and I too would very much like to see an interim solution. The reason is that the current EU OPS requirements are being interpreted to mean that all airlines that already offer child seats must revert to using the loop belt. That needs to be clarified. That is the way they are being interpreted. I know that because I have asked around and I have asked people to ring up airlines to inquire about their child safety systems. That is the information I received. That is important. It must be made clear and I believe it really is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are child seats on the market that fit into traditional aircraft seats and there are fairly cheap airbags for accompanying passengers that fit into anything and could prove useful. Clearly, a child is occupying a full seat here. Let me tell you, however, that mothers have to pay even if they hold the child on their lap – I can show you the bills, which come to more or less 60% of the adult fare depending on the airline.</p>
<p class="contents">I want those who already use a better system to be allowed to go on using that system. I ask the Commissioner to tell me whether that is or is not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to address the question of costs.

How will you deal with that? You have to ask yourself these questions, as we do, too.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of costs, there is a comparable parallel. In the case of the rights of persons with disabilities in air transport, the costs are spread across everybody, which is only normal. To conceive, give birth to and bring up a child is not just a private matter but a public task, a state task. Everybody has to be prepared to take it on and also to fund it. In my view at least, that is a matter of course. Where children up to the age of 14 can travel by train for free, it is also the other passengers who contribute to that cost.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sector of air transport in particular, which is exempt from fuel tax – i.e. EUR 14 billion a year – we can surely raise a few euro to give children the best protection they need for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I am not able to wave a magic wand because I do not possess one. Instead, I believe that we must tackle these matters in a highly responsible fashion, without saying that they will be resolved tomorrow morning because we have found an instant solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no certainty from a scientific point of view as to which are the best devices to ensure children’s safety, we can do nothing here and now, not least because under the existing Regulation it is after all the Member States’ responsibility to take decisions: those using child seats can of course continue to do so if they regard that as the best mechanism. As I said, as soon as I am presented with clearer facts – with a scientific response backed by evidence that enables me to act – I shall take action. Otherwise it would be superficial of me to say: ‘Fine, I have decided that child seats are better than safety belts’. No one is in a position to say that unless they have carried out scientific tests, with physical proof demonstrating that one system is better than another.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this is the way forward. Rather, I think that answers must be given as soon as the solution is found. In my opinion, a legislative solution will not be reached before the end of this legislative period. However, I do believe that the Commission can make it a priority to amend the existing Regulation and try to introduce measures harmonising the amendments to the Regulation, making them mandatory in all Member States. This will take time, mind you, and we may not manage to approve them before the end of the legislative term. I would reiterate that I gave certain undertakings at my hearing; to promise that legislative measures, dozens of legislative measures, will be enacted is not a viable, truthful response. Undertakings should only be made, announced and entered into on aspects that are achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding my undertaking with regard to child safety: believe it or not, I am a father, and believe it or not, the problem of youngsters is a key concern of mine. Naturally I cannot be held responsible for everything that happens in the world. Rather, I believe that a careful investigation must be carried out within a short timeframe – conclusions will be reached in October and I shall receive a response – and as soon as I receive the response I shall do whatever is necessary to attempt to protect the safety of child passengers in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, by decision of the Member States, the airlines use all necessary devices, be they child seats or safety belts. Once we have some hard, provable scientific evidence we shall be able to provide answers. Otherwise those answers will be mere opinions, and in this House – even though only a few Members are present – everyone has a different opinion about the science. Since none of us, I believe, is an expert on the matter and can give scientifically proven answers, I think we must await the findings. Given that the findings will arrive within two months, thanks to the work of the Aviation Agency, we shall then be able to take action to protect children’s safety, which I consider a priority. I repeat: I regard the safety of every citizens as a priority, especially that of our weakest citizens, which is why I shall endeavour to ensure that specific safety protection measures are adopted as rapidly as possible in keeping with the legislative timetable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
