Sustainable and competitive investment patterns will be crucial. Cohesion policy is a major source of European public investment and must work as a catalyst for structural change by investing in research and innovation, resource efficiency, new and sustainable jobs and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">It must not merely be a financial tool for investment. It is a policy that generates new resources, adding to growth potential. It will require an adequate macro-economic and financial framework to achieve its full impact. The key issue for post-2013 reform of cohesion policy is how to make it more effective in generating growth, jobs and competitiveness for the European economy in a sustainable way.</p>
<p class="contents">Social, economic and territorial cohesion is, according to the treaty, a basic principle of European integration. It must therefore be a policy applicable to all Europe’s citizens, and not one restricted to the poorest regions. This is because it is not a subsidy policy based on the principle of compensation for the past, working as a supplement to national objectives, but rather a European policy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It must take into account the post-crisis territorial reality at regional level, looking for the most effective solutions to the challenges and opportunities of different European territories. It must be made an integral part of the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and its flagship initiatives. We are intensely aware of the necessity to ensure that cohesion policy and its cumulative effect over the whole territory of the Union is one of the key instruments which will enable the Union and its Member States to achieve the ambitions of EU 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy must contribute not only to reducing productivity gaps generated by the crisis, but also to putting productivity gains on track. It must invest in better links between leading regions and those that are catching up. It must better exploit territorial cooperation potential. The Regional Development Committee of the European Parliament has reached a position as to how it sees cohesion policy post-2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, many parliamentary resolutions have stressed the necessity of maintaining a strong, comprehensive cohesion policy, well equipped with sufficient budgetary means to permit regions and cities to expand their development potential. In these exceptional times, we are convinced that they must all be encouraged and assisted to invest in ground-breaking ideas, in new technologies and in innovation. Regions and cities carry the key to re-energising Europe in order to overcome its extraordinary difficulties and to successfully achieving the transformation of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope and believe that the European Commission shares our resolve to ensure that cohesion policy remains the Union’s major all-inclusive tool. It is therefore to afford the Commission the possibility of explaining its view of the future that we have tabled this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been said more than once, regional policy and cohesion policy need to be very intensively linked to the Europe 2020 strategy in future, including in the next funding period, so that we really do achieve the European added value that we talk about again and again and that now needs to be realised. It is important, in this context, that we coordinate Union policies better in order to truly deliver a common offering, an integrated approach, including towards the Member States. The keywords must be focus and flexibility. We must focus on a few priorities from the Europe 2020 strategy that are important to us and we need flexibility in the tailor-made solutions in the implementation in the regions and in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also important that we develop a system of incentives that operate on the basis of clear agreements on objectives with the regions and the Member States so that, alongside proper financial management, which has been very important, and will continue to be so in future, the elements involved in focusing on results, too, are actually brought more strongly to bear. This is because it is absolutely crucial that, right at the beginning of a period, we also agree with the regions and the Member States what our objectives are and that we also agree on and lay down measurable targets and then strive to implement these accordingly through the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, one thing that can and should bring about good cohesion policy, with its varied elements, is being the engine of growth in the European Union. We have a Stability and Growth Pact. It is a cleverly put-together cohesion policy for all the regions, which ultimately bear the responsibility for ensuring that the growth element of the Stability and Growth Pact takes effect, so that Europe, and its national economies as a whole, remain competitive globally and are able to further improve their position in the international context.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore also be necessary to adapt and develop the framework of support accordingly. What is required, in other words, is an increase both on the product side and also of the volume of finance involved that enters the realm of financial engineering, in the knowledge – and against the backdrop of the overstretched budgets of the Member States – that, in this regard, we need to do more to develop products for private individuals in order to co-invest in certain regional projects, in particular, those that also guarantee a source of revenue, so that we leave other funding available for projects that are just as necessary but that cannot guarantee any revenue in that sense, such as investments in the education and training sector, in modernising universities and laboratories and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few weeks, we will be presenting, together, the 5th cohesion report and its conclusions. The report will put forward much of what I have been able to say in these few minutes, and much else besides. Regional policy, cohesion policy, however, is a kind of policy that is capable, including under the auspices of shared management, of making European policy something that European citizens can see and grasp.</p>
<p class="contents">Two million projects, as in the current period, can only be realised if we work together with the Member States and with the citizens in the regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment has risen sharply, with the rate expected to reach 11% at the end of this year. Furthermore, poverty continues to be a daily reality for many Europeans including children.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is true that we are slowly emerging from the economic crisis, it is equally clear that our recovery needs to be based on solid foundations, and at this time, we cannot be entirely sure about these foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must not lose sight of the long-term challenges. Issues such as the ageing population, rapidly changing technologies, climate change and other environmental challenges all need to be addressed with urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund has been the main instrument at EU level for investment in human capital and social inclusion. For over half a century, it has been a concrete proof of solidarity between European citizens and it should continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESF is one of the key tools at our disposal in reaching the Europe 2020 headline targets, particularly those on employment, education and poverty reduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We need full alignment between the ESF and Europe 2020 as it will be a major instrument for implementing the integrated guidelines. Our new Europe 2020 strategy sets out common objectives for the entire Union. However, Member States will choose their own individual paths to follow in order to reach these objectives with the support of the ESF. For this to happen, the future scope of the ESF should be broad enough to ensure that all Member States, regions and local stakeholders can design operational programmes that address their particular needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, a broad scope should not lead to a fragmentation of the instruments. The Commission and Member States should work together to establish core priorities, particularly on employment. We should work towards improving the visibility, effectiveness and delivery of the Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming budget review will show how the Commission envisages the future architecture of the Union’s budget in order to achieve the political objectives agreed in Europe 2020. In addition, it will launch the debate between Member States and the European Parliament. I look forward to the contribution of this House to that debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESF should contribute to territorial as well as social and economic cohesion alongside other EU funds. This should be facilitated by establishing some common rules for all funds to make coordination between them easier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already made a proposal for a new financial regulation laying down some common rules and we will put forward some specific proposals in the course of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens expect to see EU-level funds focused on results and achievements. We need to put in place systems to monitor the performance of the actions supported by the ESF and we need to think about moving to more results based delivery systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to the funds should be simpler and also more user-friendly. The discussions on the future of the ESF are at a decisive stage now. The messages we have received from you are very clear and will make an important contribution to the work that lies ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will present its proposal for the new ESF together with the other structural funds by mid-2011. We have a clear mandate to support the Europe 2020 strategy, namely by using the ESF as its financial lever to help translate our policy objectives into reality on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That demonstrates your desire to work together towards the overall objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion. I have also read the letter you addressed to Mr Barroso concerning cohesion as part of a single integrated structure and I trust that you will stand by that position. That would enable you to be more effective than if you were to go with an opt-out and allow the various funds to operate separately. Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p class="contents">These new, difficult, times call for a new policy. We can see evidence of that now in the Commission in connection with the Europe 2020 strategy. In that context, cohesion is at the very heart of the implementation process. The European added value, which is what we so ardently want the debate on our future to yield, is nothing more or less than a part of the implementation and is important for the 2014-2020 period.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this come down to? Do not give carte blanche when it comes to the European State aid map. Objective 2 must be retained, because it is very clear. Abandoning this objective would lead to a renationalisation of this segment of European cooperation and we do not want that. The Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund should continue to operate together.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the horizontal, integrated character of the funds is vital for the entire spectrum of Europe 2020. Sure enough, the ‘earmarking’ that Mrs Hübner introduced for the Lisbon Strategy did work at the time. The Lisbon Strategy has been successful, especially in regional and urban environments, in bringing Europe closer together. European cooperation within and between Member States brings balanced territorial development in Europe a step closer and creates opportunities for all regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to add that we must improve things. We must have greater synergy between the Rural Development Fund, the Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the Research and Development Funds. That is attainable and would lead to better results. I would like to put one final question to both Commissioners: do you want to introduce the Territorial Pact in the run-up to the Spring summit, as an opportunity for increasing the involvement of regions and towns? The Committee of the Regions has made a proposal to that effect and I would recommend that you consider it, at the same time as you consider the wording of our resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an expression of major European solidarity. Solidarity, however, is never a one-way street, and my group therefore backs the principle that all the regions of the European Union must be able to participate in our cohesion policy. For us, this also means that we will not support any measures of renationalisation and that we do not want to see cohesion policy fragmented into sector-based policy approaches. We do not need any extra transport or climate protection or energy efficiency funds, but we do need to work on how we reconcile the challenges we face with a sound cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore clear to us that, alongside a strong Objective 1 area, we also need a strong Objective 2 area, and appropriate transitional rules. One thing is for certain, and that is that regions need our support at the European level. The European Union needs strong regions, too, and there is therefore a give and take in both directions. Of course, we need to review our priorities – clearly, we do need greater efficiency. My group is therefore four-square behind the proposal, in order, for example, to be able to coordinate rural development much better together under the umbrella of cohesion policy than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also back improving infrastructure, supporting businesses and supporting sustainable economic development. However, sustainable economic development is only possible if we bring the employed – the people – with us. In other words, we need employment policy approaches, we need education, we need training, we need people to integrate into the labour market. That, in turn, is only possible in collaboration with the European Social Fund, under the umbrella of cohesion policy. We support this, but with dedicated rules, which there did used to be in the past. We need to really make an effort to improve this and significantly strengthen the social side of cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the forthcoming discussions and negotiations, my group will be going in to bat for improving and simplifying the usability of the fund. We need a simplification of the application processes so that, first of all, fewer errors are made, and, secondly, so that access for those people who really want to work can be made easier through this European cohesion policy. We will strive to ensure that, in these negotiations, a stronger partnership principle really is implemented. I believe that Parliament’s role has been strengthened now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force. My group will be arguing the case for this partnership principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is extremely important in order to deliver efficiency and to be able to use the money well, despite the limited amounts in question. I must warn, however, that the plan is to achieve this efficiency by applying one and the same set of rules to everyone. The funds are very varied, have very different target groups and different contents. With that in mind, coordination is very important but the same rules are not.</p>
<p class="contents">That is exactly what we are experiencing with the European Social Fund at the moment, which is to say that it would be extremely well received by just those little communities, municipalities, if – just as the speaker before me said – for these small bodies on the ground, in particular, such an enormous amount of time and effort did not have to be spent in order to actually be able to access and use this money. That is exactly what we need though, as unemployment, poverty and socially excluded people are to be found in every Member State of the European Union, not just in certain regions, but in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, I find it particularly important that the European Social Fund, in particular, should truly continue to be available to minorities, which, to an extent, also includes young people, but also the elderly and often people from an immigrant background, in future and actually, that it should be more available, in order to give these people the chance to enter the labour market, as that is precisely what we are aiming to achieve. The Europe 2020 strategy represents our attempt to achieve greater inclusion in the labour market for the different groups. I hope that that will not remain simply a goal; instead, we now have to genuinely provide the measures and the instruments to achieve it. The European Social Fund is a very effective tool in this regard. We just need to optimise it and, above all, make it useable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important thing in these compromise resolutions of the European Parliament is the discrete nature of the cohesion policy and a clear commitment to that. It will play its part in the Europe 2020 strategy, but it also has its own value, as it is cohesion policy that holds the EU together, at its core. No region in the European Union is shoved to one side. Social cohesion also means that no one, from the poorest of the poor, is pushed aside in the European Union, and instead, everyone is given a chance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, prosperity does not just mean economic growth, as we have seen in the past how there can be a growth of GDP in many regions, but an intensification of social differences at the same time. I therefore consider it very important that, in this resolution, the impetus is given for us to develop other important criteria alongside the GDP that make it clear what prosperity means and what needs to be done in a region.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are very proud of our achievement in having this fixed in the resolution, even if only cautiously. We propose that the criterion is one which includes examining whether it is possible to support a region or not. That would result in a very different picture.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the resolution comes out very clearly in favour of a ‘GDP beyond’ and we hope that the Commission takes up this stimulus. That also means that we will finally get away from one-sided development. A further Commission study – namely, the Commission’s Regions 2020 study – shows that climate change has an alarming and detrimental impact on regional development. We therefore need to stop it. The study shows that a third of the population of the European Union would have to abandon their homes if we failed to stop climate change, as they would either be unable to find work or to live in their homes any longer. This makes it clear that there are three sides to regional development. All three of these sides must be given equal weight in the future reform of the structural funds and also taken into consideration in the support given. One key interest is economic, social and territorial cohesion. That means that ecological issues and criteria, too, represent a key element in the prosperity of regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to briefly enunciate one more thought about what has been negotiated here between Members, namely, the wording about how the ESF is to be dealt with in the joint package. I believe that the oral amendment is well worded and allows us a great deal of free scope and I therefore ask you to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, it will be very difficult to find a meaningful and rational consensus that will win the support of as many Members as possible. In my view, the first key question is what financial resources we should allocate to the cohesion policy. Personally, I am convinced that existing resources are more or less sufficient. The cohesion policy should, however, become one of the main spending priorities of the European budget. As the European budget is constrained, and Member States have seriously ailing public finances and cannot allow more money to be sent to Brussels, it is also necessary to state clearly where cuts might be made. In my view, this includes, for example, direct payments to farmers, money for the globalisation fund or the administrative costs of European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key question is what we should finance from the European funds. In the draft resolution on the European Social Fund, much is being said about the fight against poverty, support for the social model, etc. That is all very well, but in the first place, our economy must prosper, people must have work, and companies must produce and provide services. Therefore, European funds should be geared towards investment, and not consumption. The funds should make possible modernisation which, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, cannot be taken on by the state, the regions, communities or families. Reducing the economic disparities between regions and Member States must continue to be the main goal of the cohesion policy. Therefore, the only rational criterion is the level of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I can say that we are interested in a cohesion policy that will be comprehensible, simple, flexible, unencumbered by excessive bureaucracy, and focused on investment and smart growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Lisbon recommends that the ESF should focus primarily on active labour market policy. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that it is necessary for the ESF to be applied more broadly in future to general social policy and, most importantly, to be used much more effectively to combat poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, the European Social Fund should also play an effective role throughout the entire European Union and should not concentrate solely on specific regions. However, we think that there should be a greater focus on special problems in the regions, which could be accommodated more effectively via the cofinancing rates. Financing for the European Social Fund should at least stay at its current level. It should be a minimum of 1% of the gross budget of the European Union. We believe that to be absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight one other problem. The proposed increased focus on the results naturally gives rise to the question with regard to the ESF of which indicators and benchmarks will form the basis for evaluating the results and what that ultimately means in terms of preparation for the project promoters in each case. These promoters do not have reserves which would allow them to make additional payments or repayments. If the ESF is to remain in existence and play an effective role, we need to have a clear overview of this issue in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although many areas of Wales benefit under the Convergence Objective, reflecting the country’s economic shortcomings, as many as seven Welsh regions are now threatened with losing EU money.</p>
<p class="contents">EU funding to Wales, currently worth GBP 280 million, could be withdrawn. Financial support to numerous projects created under the auspices of the Regional Competitiveness Programme could be stripped, threatening thousands of associated jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission thought, at the very least, to draw up an impact assessment to judge the social and economic consequences of cutting funds? What transitional measures are being proposed? Spending on debt-ridden eurozone countries, including Greece, was pursued with little hesitation and amounts to a trillion euros over three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Wales also suffers high unemployment levels and will be greatly affected by forthcoming UK Government civil service cuts. Another threat to Wales could be the proposed renationalisation of structural funding, which could see Britain undersold on entitlement to support.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK, as a net contributor, would likely be expected to bear the heaviest fiscal burden. The EUR 55 billion spent on regional competitiveness and employment funding account for just 6% of the entire EU budget. The UK will continue to pour increasing amounts of money into Brussels, yet the one area where some of that money is recouped – albeit very little – is the area the Commission are looking to axe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, my opinion that the people of Wales would be better off if the UK left the EU. That way, we could save billions and be the sole dictators of where much-needed financial provision is channelled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF. This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future. Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds. The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome. Its legitimacy is not in doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means. Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority. I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators. That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake. Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy. Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible. Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Employment, poverty, the economic, financial and social crisis in the European Union, and the subsequent austerity measures in the budgets of the Member States, force us, at European level, to fully address the issues of employment and social policies and to regard the European Social Fund (ESF) as a tool of EU economic policy and the EU budget for meeting not only the treaty objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion but also the objectives of the strategy, the draft of which the Heads of State or Government have just accepted, which include increasing the employment rate and combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, with the ESF now under review, I would like to send out some signals to Commissioner Andor. We think that the regions are the effective authorising bodies of European public expenditure. However, that does not mean that the instruments of economic policy must be reduced to the imperative of territorial cohesion. Cohesion also includes economic and social cohesion. It may be scheduled by the regions, but it must meet economic and social objectives that concern all parts of the European Union. Commissioner, when you review these rules, I urge you to take account of the experience gained in the implementation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, where the capacity exists for individualisation and for adaptation to each of the workers concerned, which may also be useful for the European Social Fund. I also urge you to link in some of the objectives of our Europe 2020 strategy: employability, employment, the fight against poverty, and research and development. Research and development is certainly very important for Galileo and others. Commissioner, as regards social innovation, there is an immense wasteland, which I urge you to explore using the ESF with, no doubt, in this case, somewhat different cofinancing deals. I fully endorse what Mrs Zimmer said: employability cannot be the sole objective of the ESF. There is also the question of combating social exclusion and taking into account the most vulnerable sections of the population – the young, women, people with disabilities and the Roma population, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say a word on the conditions of use of the ESF. We know everyone says: ‘There is Kafka in the home, there is Kafka in Brussels.’ There are rules for the use of the ESF which are too difficult to implement. Therefore, let us think about a kind of geometry which varies depending on the quality of the use of public expenditure by the regions. Where regions are happily capable of being authorising bodies, let us relax control. Where there is a need for administrative support, let us invent new mechanisms. And, finally, as regards the return of the money that is not used in the budgets of the Member States, I urge you to imagine abolishing this rule, which is not the right way to use the European Social Funds to further employment and social inclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we are all aware, it entails much more than simply job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on the European Social Fund emphasises the role it plays in achieving the EU 2020 strategy objectives. Without regional policy instruments, this strategy has no chance of being successfully implemented at national, regional or local level. As a result, as long as regional policy and social policy are interconnected policies which operate successfully together, I believe that we should not agree, under any circumstances, to the separation of the European Social Fund from the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a decision would pave the way for funds to be allocated on a sectoral basis, thereby creating an undesirable precedent for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund must remain part of the Structural Funds, especially as it has proven its effectiveness in every region of Europe, given that it is actually a key weapon in the battle against the economic crisis, in addition to the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We need a strong, well-funded EU regional policy in order to achieve social, economic and territorial cohesion. I therefore believe that the regional aspect must continue to enjoy its appropriate place as part of both the revised EU budget and the future budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reject any attempt at renationalisation. The regional policy is not a charity policy, but an EU policy intended for all regions, which will generate economic growth, innovation and competitiveness, making it an instrument available to every Member State. If we want solutions which are appropriate to the needs and realities which we are going to face in the future as well, we must maintain the same framework. By that, I mean both the basic principles and the sums allocated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge is to identify the best instrument to enable us to measure the state of development of the European regions as accurately as possible and to have at our disposal the best decision support instrument, especially for deciding on eligibility for European funds. It is about having a political compass to guide us towards this ‘targeted approach to territorial development’, to quote the proposed resolution, towards this integrated approach. What is this guide on which to base our regional cohesion policies? Today, we have just a single indicator, gross domestic product, which is an excellent indicator and an excellent instrument for measuring economic growth and the production of wealth. However, regional development issues are not confined to increasing gross domestic product. People’s well-being cannot simply be expressed as an index or a curve. If it could, we would be in danger of ending up with an indicator that gives nothing more than a distorted, partial and therefore one-sided view. To pursue regional cohesion policies that are relevant to the objective of the sustainable development of the regions – which, I would point out, is our shared objective – the gross domestic product index must be supplemented by other instruments of measurement, particularly in the social and environmental spheres. It must be possible to assess the level of unemployment, insecure employment, education, health, environmental quality, air and water quality, protection of resources, access to basic services, etc. In conclusion, therefore, we need to do our utmost to establish, alongside gross domestic product, a battery of social and environmental indicators to facilitate regional cohesion policies whose aim is sustainable development based on the three pillars of economic factors, social factors and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all of these regions are homogeneous. There are major differences between them in terms of wealth, development and standard of living. To reduce these differences and to make the regions more competitive, the European Union implemented a regional cohesion and convergence policy based on solidarity and endowed with the appropriate financial resources: the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the cohesion funds. Nevertheless, despite the progress made, it would be illusory to believe that these differences will disappear in 2013, or even in 2020. Consequently, it would be advisable to maintain the principles of cohesion policy and the accompanying financial resources beyond 2013. Naturally, this regional cohesion and convergence policy must be pursued alongside other strategies, such as the EU 2020 strategy. However, it must be pursued independently of this strategy and we must ensure that it does not appropriate or absorb any of the funds allocated to cohesion policy under the pretext of regionalising a specific objective of the EU 2020 strategy.

We all know that this has not been the case. Those same people were hoping to get their people into key positions to cream off commissions from the appropriation of European funds. Now that the Bulgarian people have voted them out of office, there is nobody to step forward and take their place to help Bulgaria absorb European funds effectively. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a reluctant admission but Bulgaria is a new country. It cannot measure itself against France, Germany and the other founder members.

We want a strong cohesion policy and structural policy in all the European regions. It does not matter whether we are talking about a net contributor or one of the poorer Member States; structural policy remains the strongest expression of European solidarity. We are helping the poorest regions to catch up with their neighbours, but we are also helping the stronger regions to remain competitive. Europe will only be able to develop sustainably in areas such as environmental protection, industry and energy supplies, and to conquer global markets, if it can make the best technologies even better.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that we achieve these objectives, we need clear and fair rules. This means that the poorer regions must remain the central focus of cohesion policy. The lower the gross domestic product (GDP) of a region, the more help it must receive from us. Anyone who questions the use of GDP as an indicator, such as the Greens and, unfortunately, some Liberals and Socialists, is attacking the very roots of European solidarity. GDP is the guarantee that social force, education and job opportunities are fully taken into account. Poor regions often cannot provide all these things on an adequate level and they also lose out when it comes to protecting the environment. Therefore, GDP must remain the reliable indicator for regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to rely on our local authorities and federal states when it comes to regional policy. We want to implement the Europe 2020 strategy on the basis of the tried and tested principle of the joint development of programmes, joint administration and regional cofinancing. For this reason, the calls for independent EU funds for employment, climate protection and energy must not be allowed to become reality. If we were to replace regional policy with a stronger sectoral policy, the only winners would be new EU agencies, and our local authorities and federal states would be mere onlookers with regard to regional policy and cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the European Parliament has taken up a clear position on behalf of the regions. This has to do with accepting the European idea. We cannot force people to accept it. The acceptance has to develop from the bottom upwards as part of regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the internal market, social policy is the next on the list, followed by economic, social and territorial cohesion. That gives an indication of the priorities in the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from that, Article 9 clearly states that in defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union should take account of requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health. This issue is highlighted in Article 10 of our resolution on the future of the Social Fund and is, to me, of crucial importance.</p>
<p class="contents">That gives us our framework. I agree with many of the speakers who have argued that we need a framework to establish synergies between all European policies and the Structural Funds. Indeed, these must act as drivers that will help us to achieve the EU 2020 targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Commissioner Andor when he says that EU citizens expect results based delivery systems. There is also a strong argument for greater visibility of these funds, and an urgent need for simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">I regularly speak to voluntary, community, and other groups who access these funds. They have serious issues with the levels of bureaucracy and red tape that confront them. But it is not just that usual red tape: there is also uncertainty over interpretation of the rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have discussed this issue of simplification again and again in committee and in plenary, and yet nothing has changed for the better. In connection with rules and regulations, a colleague recently asked me why there is an insistence on ‘pouring sand into every moving part’. Given that context, this issue really needs to be dealt with. Perhaps we can begin to get it right this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would once again like to emphasise and ensure that Article 9, or the ‘social clause’, permeates all our policy decisions, because that really will lead to cohesion in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We consider the region to be the appropriate level at which to structure European economic policies. Indeed, it has a natural ability to withstand globalisation and, consequently, to sustain employment and ensure its fair distribution throughout Europe. Secondly, territorial cohesion policy must, in our view, form part of the long-term future. The threshold of 75% of GDP will naturally be renewed in 2014. However, do people think that if the poorest regions pass the 75% threshold in future, European territorial cohesion will be complete? Can the gap between 75% for the poorest and 150% or more for the richest – twice as much – be taken to represent the fulfilment of Europe’s objectives in territorial cohesion terms? We should therefore take a long-term view of European cohesion policy. The threshold of 90% seems to me to be an objective that we can actually set today, while at the same time clearly prioritising those who are still under 75%. Finally, with regard to the priorities of this policy: many people have spoken of social cohesion, particularly through the European Social Fund (ESF), of the fight against global warming and of territorial cooperation beyond borders, which is also a priority of the Commission; I shall not dwell on this matter. I would like to focus on the promotion of Europe’s diversity. It is expressed primarily at the level of the regions and their cultural heritage, and it is an asset that will be taken into account and emphasised within the context of regional development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the fact that the money made available by the European Union to the regions is not intended to satisfy grassroots needs; it is intended for projects needed by capital. Thirdly, the fact that the debate on cuts in resources serves the interests of the large capitalist groups and, fourthly, the fact that the plans of capital for future cohesion policy serve speedier capitalist restructurings and the anti-grassroots EU 2020 strategy, which is also being used in Greece to reform the state on the basis of the Kapodistrias and Kallikratis plans.</p>

It only follows that by underlining the importance and necessity of the cohesion policy, in a sense, we also want to ensure that during the upcoming budget debates, the common European policy at issue becomes consolidated, not fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is no doubt and it has been pointed out by many that the creation of workplaces and the increase in employment are very high on the list of priorities, we also know that European labour markets are experiencing structural tension. While, in some areas, workplaces often lack people with the right qualifications or skills, elsewhere, highly qualified people struggle to find a job due to a lack of appropriate workplaces. It is obvious that the European Social Fund has a pivotal role in counteracting this situation, with policies designed to eliminate these differences and bring them closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking about large-scale projects. We are talking about small projects and more flexible adjustment. While we endorse and support the concept of a single policy and the exploitation of synergies in the context of cohesion policy, I would also like to emphasise that where the Social Fund is concerned, we need a higher degree of flexibility and transparency and fewer rules. In this sense, there should be separate rules that apply to the Social Fund, and I welcome the Commissioner’s statement about introducing a result-oriented assessment, considering that the biggest problem with these policies – one that also undermines their authority – is often that we are unable to see the results of funds spent in specific areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that Commissioner Andor does not need to be persuaded about the successful delivery of the social policy aspects of cohesion policy, thanks to the strong synergy of the ESF and ERDF. Nor do the other two Commissioners dealing with EU funds in rural development and fisheries need to be persuaded that they are more effective working together with other funds, as they used to be, than on their own, as in the current period.</p>
<p class="contents">I am among those who expect that in the next period, we should have proposals for even stronger synergies between a strong cohesion policy and all the other funds, based on the fact that all of them together can deliver far better results than each one on its own. But for some reason I fail to understand, there are voices inside the Commission that are calling for an approach of sectoral instruments, ignoring (in my view) the realities on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, what we say in our resolution, which I strongly hope and believe will be adopted by a very large majority later today, is supported not only by this House but also by the majority of Member States, all 271 regions of Europe and thousands of local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, if the Commission follows the path of sectorisation of EU resources, we will arrive in a unique and conflictual situation where the Commission will be on one side and everybody else – Parliament, the Council and the regions – on the other side.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, the side which believes that future EU policies would be best covered within an integrated approach to planning, implementation and delivery will have to engage in a serious fight with the side which believes that sectorisation of EU resources is the way to go.

This experience tells us clearly that where money was spent on hard infrastructure investments and in accordance, primarily, with the GDP criterion, the expenditure brought advantages to the entire European Union, both to Member States which are net contributors to European funds and to those which are net beneficiaries. Acceleration of the process of reducing disparities in the level of infrastructure strengthened the common market and facilitated investment, which, after all, continues to flow mainly from net contributors to net beneficiaries. This gave clear European added value, which is something we have talked so much about today.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is with concern that I look at a situation in which we are planning a reform of cohesion policy and adding new criteria – very vague social and ecological criteria – to the system for distribution of these funds.

It is, for example, clear to us that we must continue to support these regions, which currently fail to achieve even 75% of the average gross domestic product of the European Union. However, the financial resources allotted to them should be mainly directed as a matter of priority towards constructing basic infrastructure, supporting human resources or employment, greater investment in science, research and innovation, and the target of green growth.

<p class="contents">I do believe, then, in this context, that funds such as the ESF have a vital role to play in ensuring the employability of those who are hard to reach and low-skilled.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Northern Ireland receive significant funding from the ESF administered through the Department for Learning and Employment, and I note that in a recent House of Lords enquiry into the ESF, it was noted the ESF continues to make a significant contribution to supporting economic growth in Northern Ireland, aimed at creating a knowledge-based economy with a highly skilled and flexible workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that future ESF projects and the money directed towards them can be considered in the context of domestic schemes, many of which have similar aims. That level of joined up and targeted thinking can only bring greater rewards. Regional flexibility is of the utmost importance for the successful operation of the ESF.</p>
<p class="contents">Post-2013, I believe that the limited resources of the ESF should continue to be focused on assisting the hardest to reach and least skilled into work or back into work through access to training and further education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, and must remain, the pillar of European integration. It must continue to play an essential role as an instrument for reconciling the differences between Member States while, at the same time, strengthening regional identities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, notwithstanding the architecture of cohesion policy and having reaffirmed the value and relevance of multi-level governance, partnership and the integrated approach as fundamental principles, this resolution affirms the advantages of combining GDP, which must remain the only criterion for determining eligibility, with new and more meaningful indicators for the sole purpose of analysis and assessment; the need to lay down new rules for the European Social Fund, which should nonetheless be maintained under the regulation on general provisions concerning cohesion policy; and the need to simplify procedures and use financial engineering instruments, as Commissioner Hahn also stated.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I am referring to Commissioner Hahn’s speech, in particular, to the point where he mentioned the importance of maintaining the Stability Pact within the context of cohesion policy. That is all well and good, but to achieve that aim, the wretched agreement that stipulates that investment expenditure must be calculated within the parameters of the Stability Pact needs to be scrapped or amended, because it would be like asking for more investment expenditure on the one hand, and then punishing it by reducing it, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges facing the European Union are difficult ones: employment, growth, development and competitiveness. These are the objectives of the European strategy, which provides for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. As many people have said, these can only be addressed if the future European financial framework takes into account the importance of regional policy, in order to achieve true economic, social and territorial cohesion, and if it is able to guarantee adequate financing despite the constraints on resources by carrying forward a policy where objectives are set according to priorities and assessed according to results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is vital to reduce the imbalances not only for the sake of the European Union, but also of every individual citizen and region, which requires not only human resources, but also sufficient financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The current cohesion policy requires improvements, without any major amendments. Above all, we must reject and refuse to renationalise and underfund it. At this juncture, when rich or less rich Member States are being hit by the effects of the economic crisis, cutting the budget allocated to the cohesion policy would be tantamount to jeopardising all the successes over recent years and the reduction in the disparities which we have been endeavouring to combat up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I agree with the view of President José Manuel Durão Barroso that the budget allocated to the cohesion policy in the future must be at least equal to the current one.

We must support it. However, we have to find where the problems are at present. I would point out to the Commissioner that, as at 1 September, the absorption rate for the Social Fund was just 18%, which is half as much – twice as bad – as in the previous period.</p>
<p class="contents">17 Member States are at less than 18%. Some of them are stuck at 10% or 11% absorption when it comes to the Social Fund. There is no pattern here: the countries with the biggest deficit are not showing the worst absorption rates. But the fact is that some countries were stuck at 10% throughout 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has to clarify the situation. If one looks at the other funds – the Regional Fund and the Cohesion Fund – the situation is no better. The overall absorption rate is 17.95%. Also, 60% of Member States have a lower absorption than this. For some of them, the figure is three times less.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has cut the funding under the draft budget for 2011 to less than EUR 1 000 million because the Member States have no clear idea about fulfilling their obligations. We in the Committee on Budgets supported the Committee on Regional Development in its request to restore the funding to the draft budget. The question is whether it will be possible for this money to be absorbed. If it cannot, there is no sense talking about a bright future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I believe that the draft prepared by Mrs Hübner, the former Commissioner for Regional Policy, is also balanced and, in fact, good. I understand that we all know that the crisis has created a challenge for many Member States that are net contributors, as a result of which there is pressure for the next financial perspective to be reduced in money terms. In such a case, this major heading that cohesion policy represents is also extremely important. However, it is important for all of us not to get confused, but be a little more conservative and not let go of two fundamentals of cohesion policy, namely, that it is an independent policy, the main objective of which is still, and will remain, the equalisation of development between less well-developed regions and the rest of the European Union, and second, that per capita gross domestic product by purchasing power parity is nevertheless the main criterion. If we disregard these fundamentals, any other debates (such as how better to align cohesion policy with the achievement of the European Union’s 2020 targets) will fail to achieve anything, even with ‘EU 2020’ in the context of cohesion policy.

For the period from 2007 to 2013, EUR 75 billion is available for the European Social Fund (ESF) and this amounts to almost 8% of the EU budget. As Brussels will only provide the money for the ESF when the Member States take responsibility for cofinancing, this means that there will be around EUR 150 billion on the table for creating more and better jobs. Fortunately, ESF money is not used to fund unnecessary studies, but instead goes directly to the people who need it. This is what makes it so valuable and what allows people to experience it at first hand, including the long-term unemployed, migrants, young people who have the opportunity to obtain the school leaving qualifications that they missed out on first time around, tens of thousands of trainees and retrainees, employees who want further training and budding entrepreneurs. It has a wide range of target groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What will happen after 2013? The Member States must make more effective use of the funding and we also need to take the special features of individual regions into account. I would like to see a tailor-made, bottom-up approach and effective coordination with programmes such as Daphne and PROGRESS. I am in favour of more flexibility, simpler controls and more transparent allocation of funding. However, I am opposed to a separate legal framework for the ESF. I believe it should remain within the Structural Fund regulation, which will ensure that the eligibility of expenditure is regulated at the level of the Member States. This is why I have tabled Amendment 1, together with 45 of my fellow Members, and I would ask you to support it in the forthcoming vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to capitalise on our successes with this crucial policy and amend it as required to make it more accessible and more visible. We want a strong, well-financed policy that really helps to bring about economic development for all of our regions. We want simplified rules, and we do not just want to hear them talked about; we want them to be implemented for project leaders and potential beneficiaries. We want outermost towns and regions to receive special attention. I worked on this resolution when it was with the working group and Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development.

However, I would like to talk about the role of the European Social Fund, which has a fundamental role and significance in cohesion policy as well, because if large groups are falling behind, then we also have a problem with the cohesion policy. The role of the European Social Fund will be enhanced further by the 2020 strategy, as employability is a key issue. At this point, I would like to draw your attention to two issues:</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to make sure there is a second chance. We must provide a second chance for those who have lost their jobs in the crisis which accelerated certain globalisation processes, such as the massive exodus of mass production from Europe, and for those who cannot use their skills on the labour market because there is no demand for them. This is what we call ‘skill mismatch’. A second chance must also be provided for those who are unemployable due to a lack of any qualifications, such as school drop-outs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that the 2020 strategy would increase the level of employment among women by 25%. However, this will be possible only if Member States can provide, with the assistance of the European Social Fund, the indispensable backing in the area of services, particularly childcare and elderly care. Since the support required is often smaller in extent, payment rules would probably need to be more flexible than for projects funded from the large structural funds. What is absolutely inevitable is to ensure that supervision and evaluation are more stringent in order to make funding more transparent and more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, discussion of cohesion policy is, to a great extent, discussion about the European Union – about what the Union is, how it is supposed to function and how it is supposed to be understood by the citizens. We are not only talking about money; we are also thinking of whether we are really putting in place measures which lead to economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take note of the fact that cohesion policy is a very special instrument, because it combines, on the one hand, reduction of disparities with the support of measures which lead to greater competitiveness. These two objectives are not incompatible – they make cohesion policy favourable to development. It is worth talking about this, because the policy is not one of charity, but is, in fact, a policy of measures intended to assist development. This is why it is part of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is worth saying that it is the only policy which is extremely complicated in terms of putting it into effect, because it is based on a common administration which is shared with the Member States. This means, on the one hand, that the instruments involved are extremely difficult and the procedures are very complicated, but, on the other, it produces a clear effect of cooperation between the European Union, Member States and local authorities. In view of this, let us not defend cohesion policy only in the context of the new economic conditions. Let us give thought to how to improve and strengthen it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many municipal and regional representatives have been talking about how to address the serious problems our cities are facing and about the old and new needs affecting workers, families, and small and large production companies alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis that has hit our societies has made it harder and more difficult for all of us to find suitable solutions to a new and serious social issue. In this context, I believe everyone has come to understand that, time and again, cohesion policy has been the only real instrument the regions have had available to them for trying to provide solutions. We can therefore say that over the last few years, cohesion policy has provided a vital fillip to the European integration process for all of the regions. Now we are having to redefine this policy for the period after 2013, and we are therefore at a turning point. That is why it is vitally important to avoid certain risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The first fundamental risk would be to renationalise it: that would be a serious step backwards. Next, when preparing the financing budget, we must lay down appropriate requirements with regard to the weaker areas without penalising the more competitive and more advanced regions. Lastly, it is essential to simplify the procedures for those who have demonstrated efficiency and to make more legally binding the power to penalise those who have not. We expect the Commission to take action along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment rates across the European Union have shot up. In Portugal, for example, we have unfortunately reached the record level of 11% unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another negative phenomenon is unemployment among young people in the EU. Europe is thus going through a period of transformation and faces huge challenges. The crisis has wiped out years of economic and social progress and exposed the weaknesses in its Member States’ economies and, accordingly, in the economy of the EU itself. The Europe 2020 strategy is showing us which ways to go. The EU must intensify all its efforts to promote employment and social inclusion as an integral part of its strategy to fight the economic and social crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the motion for a resolution on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF), which we are debating today, because this fund plays a crucial role in achieving the Europe 2020 targets. This fund is, in fact, the main financial instrument enabling the EU to fulfil the strategic aims of its employment policy, through improving the education and training levels of the people of Europe. The ESF must be strengthened as the principal driving force behind Europe 2020, and it needs to be used by the Member States to invest in reskilling, employment, training and vocational retraining.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that the ESF reform, to be carried out in conjunction with the reform of the other structural funds, should not only facilitate and simplify its management and improve transparency, but also focus funds on results and achievements that can make a difference to the general public in their daily lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I believe it is very important not only to reconfirm them, but also to give thought to their effectiveness by introducing some sort of flexibility between one fund and another. I refer primarily to the European Social Fund, which is crucial today in order to guarantee the quality of future jobs in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly important to stimulate recovery and growth, but it is necessary to focus on competitive models that incorporate both the quality of what is produced through knowledge and the quality of how it is produced. Quality jobs are very important for people’s dignity, as well as for their profit-making capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Social Fund needs specific and simple rules. Simplicity is not the enemy of effectiveness and quality, and if there are strict controls, it is even less likely to lead to actions that break the rules. I believe that simplification and greater control should be tightly linked. That way, we can truly equip the Europe 2020 strategy with instruments that have proven to be effective, but which have also demonstrated the need for certain updates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far. We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler. Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment. Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role. It seems that we all agree on this.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one. It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, at Member State level, policy makers may use alternative indicators to eliminate its deficiencies, if any, and to account for environmental and social aspects of development. However, in order to assert European solidarity and ensure that Member States can catch up successfully, it is essential that GDP remains the fundamental and exclusive indicator for the distribution of funds at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to point out that this is especially important for island territories, which are all external borders of the European Union, and therefore, they are very vulnerable in terms of security to illegal trafficking and also to threats from globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, every EU initiative on a Brussels level has regional and local effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the 1970s, structural aid has been available for disadvantaged regions in order to ensure that the growth of the economy and of prosperity is geographically balanced. However, looking at the current situation, we seem not to have come any closer to achieving these goals. For example, the billions paid in subsidies to the regions of Ireland and Greece have not protected them from feeling the full force of the financial and economic crisis. Those regions which lost their status as Objective 1 zones during the enlargement in 2004 are not much better off. Their situation has only improved in statistical terms, in other words, on paper, but it is a well-known fact that you cannot eat paper. Large regions may be showing strong growth, but they can, at the same time, contain small regions which are fighting for survival.</p>

<p class="contents">Overcoming the crisis, which has been a difficult one for all of us, and achieving the objectives of the 2020 economic strategy, necessitate cohesion policy and clear objectives, both for Member States and for regions. We have designated this year as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. We are also going to continue with this objective until 2020. We will not achieve this without the European Social Fund being incorporated into cohesion policy. This is what local authorities expect, too, and this is also being said by the Committee of the Regions, which represents them. We should, therefore, take very strong account of their opinion in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, so far, European policy regarding trans-European networks has met with a pitiful and resounding lack of funding, both from the European Union and from the Member States, especially in the cross-border sections, which everyone considers to be no-man’s-land.</p>

Cohesion policy is the basis for implementing the sustainable development of urban agglomerations and rural areas, taking into account their specific character and possibilities.

It therefore needs to be closely coordinated with the Regional Development Fund. It is essential to take a local approach to the problems that need solving: in other words, global vision for local action. Local and regional authorities are the ones that know best what the situation is like on the ground, how much investment in job creation they need, and what the most suitable measures are to promote employment in their regions. We have to take account of the positive experiences of the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Azores, an outermost region where unemployment generally reaches record levels, the unemployment rate is now 6.5%, the lowest in Portugal. That is largely due to the forward-planning strategy used for employment, which sets out which factors to address and how to achieve the desired targets, and also to the use of the ESF as an operational instrument of this strategy, acting on education and training and furthering employment.</p>

I think we all agree that a truly united Europe will only be built in the medium and long term if the levels of economic development are balanced across Europe. It is indispensable for the efficient implementation of the EU 2020 strategy and for reaching its objectives that regions with different levels of development all benefit from the process. This is why it is vital to keep cohesion policy funds available to less developed regions at their current level.

Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion is no longer just economic and social; it is also territorial. Regional policy is one of the spearheads of European integration. It is the second heading in the Union’s budget, after the common agricultural policy. Europe needs to adopt an integrated strategy for the development of its regions. The development of cross-border transport links is one of the major challenges of this policy. One of the priorities in this area is the route across the Pyrenees between France and Spain, which specifically concerns the European constituency of the South West. At the moment, the road and rail links do not meet expectations. Some regions, although linked from a socio-economic point of view, do not today enjoy adequate means of communication. The various projects that the Commission is due to carry forward in this geographical area will be carried out in the medium and long terms. They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, this fund plays a significant role in the areas of the education of workers, lifelong vocational training, the improvement of work opportunities and the integration of workers into the labour market. I agree that in order to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, especially in the areas of employment and social affairs, we must strengthen the ESF and increase its effectiveness, while improving this fund’s financing procedures. Currently, this fund’s financing system is far too complicated and therefore, it is very important for the Commission to simplify the financing procedures for the structural funds and make them more flexible, because only this will enable Member States to use money allocated from the ESF as effectively and efficiently as possible for the creation of new and better jobs. In terms of financing from the structural funds, we must not forget transparency and the strengthening of control over money earmarked for aid. Furthermore, I call on the Commission to distribute ESF money in an even more effective and targeted manner in future and to take all possible measures to ensure that EU money goes directly to people experiencing poverty, who need that aid the most. Only a more effective and stronger fund can contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in Europe in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly worth mentioning that the common position presented in the draft resolution emphasises the call based on experience from the current programming period for the structure of the cohesion policy for the period after 2013 to be simple, fair, and transparent. I consider GDP to be the main criterion for determining eligibility for assistance within the framework of regional policy. It is possible, however, to discuss the addition of other measurable indicators for determining eligibility for assistance within the framework of regional policy, insofar as their significance can be proven. At the same time, I consider it important to maintain the European Social Fund as part of the regulation on general provisions relating to financial resources within the framework of the cohesion policy. We need to emphasise that this fund should have its own rules. In the formation of regional policy and cohesion policy after 2013, I consider it absolutely necessary to coordinate these policies in the area of rural development with the other pillar of the common agricultural policy, so that the two policies do not work at cross purposes and lead to mutually contradictory goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their role in the success of the EU 2020 strategy is crucial. Like the vast majority of my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development, I feel it is imperative to guarantee for the future a strong and well-financed cohesion policy that is aimed at all European regions. Last year, it was rumoured that the European Commission might be planning a partial renationalisation of the Structural Funds. That is unacceptable. I shall fight to safeguard the European added value of cohesion policy at regional level. Some people would also like to concentrate the Structural Funds even further on the poorest regions. This is madness: cohesion policy is not meant to be a policy of handouts; the so-called rich regions also experience many social and economic structural problems. Cohesion requires solidarity between all regions. It would be worth examining the relevance of the criteria used to assess eligibility for the Structural Funds. While GDP must remain the main criterion, the Commission should also look at other indicators that might better account for regional difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evident that the ESF has to adapt itself again, because circumstances have changed. It has to be adapted to the EU 2020 strategy, where raising employment is a key goal. It has to adapt to the crisis. The ESF is not a crisis management tool per se, but now it has to function during a period of crisis. We should not forget that, even when macro-economic crises are over, employment levels may remain low. Unemployment has risen in Europe. Some European countries are forced to introduce budget cuts, which threaten jobs, especially in the public sector. The majority of public workers are women. Therefore, public sector lay-offs threaten women in the first instance. Enhancing women’s labour market participation is a key goal for EU 2020 and for all reasonable political decision makers – women’s participation is particularly important in order to protect and reshape our social model. Therefore, we should help those who lose their jobs due to budget cuts. Some countries would favour the ESF being nationalised to some extent in the next budget.

These include district heating investments, certain energy efficiency projects and local and regional energy network development projects. We must improve the future use of existing EU funds in a way that supports energy efficiency measures, and encourage a wider use of structural funds and Cohesion Fund sources for this purpose.

At the same time, we should not allow the cohesion policy to be fragmented. EU 2020 will be an important component of the future cohesion policy; however, it cannot become its substitute. A radical simplification of the rules of financing is badly needed in order to make EU funds better available at the local and NGO level. These levels offer the best potential for a meaningful and well-targeted use of EU means. At this point, the often excessive bureaucratic accountability takes more time and energy than goes to the real working out of the projects. Such an imbalance is an increasingly serious practical and moral obstacle for further progress. When preparing the framework for the next financial period, it will be important to engage in time the representatives of the regions and the business sector. Their experience and practical sense should be seen as a valuable contribution in efficiently implementing the future regional policy and in obtaining additional resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the opportunities provided by and the positive effects of the European Economic Recovery Plan will also decrease in the future. Under the plan, the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 800/2008) had previously allowed Member States to provide, on a temporary basis, additional subsidies and compensation for the employment of people with disabilities, subject to a number of conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the simplification proposed for the ESF, it is not the issues related to the management of the fund that should be the main focus. Instead, the priority should be to make sure that synergy (cross-subsidies and eligibility) is actually achieved in the course of planning and implementation by Member States. Furthermore, the continued increase in the number of experts without useful qualifications should be curtailed, because unemployment in disadvantaged groups should be reduced. At the same time, experts’ networks and professional cooperation should be strengthened. One framework for achieving this could be the development of cross-border cooperation based on intra-regional connections.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, let me comment on what Commissioners Hahn and Andor said: issues of urbanisation and sustainability should be given more attention as well. The reduction of burdens on families and of the disproportionate distribution of tasks within society which makes it difficult to start a family, as well as improving accessibility, are essential in reaching and ensuring a more active and healthier old age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who are well informed know that debates on the future shape of this policy are now starting to become more intense. Sometimes, the question is even raised as to whether this policy should exist at all. The cohesion policy has its supporters, but also its critics. I would like to mention the fundamental idea behind the creation of the cohesion policy in 1974 – the principle of solidarity between the economically more advanced and the economically weaker areas. In the EU, significant differences remain, and until they are evened out, the problem-free implementation of the idea of free movement of services or capital is unthinkable. There are a number of expert studies showing that the cohesion policy functions in principle, and creates the desired added value, and I therefore see critical voices more as a warning against procedural failures and a call for improvement in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the situation has changed since 1974 and that the cohesion policy is now an important instrument for the development of European regions and towns. This is also a strong argument for it to continue and to encompass the entire territory of the EU. It is necessary to have a discussion on the level of support in different regions, which will result from negotiations between the Council and Parliament. I trust that the Commission will come forward with good proposals. I would like to express my firm belief that with the right set-up, the critics will fall silent and will defend the existence of the cohesion policy for all EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the issues included in the resolution are of current concern to Latvia. Unfortunately, in the cohesion policy programme, Latvia is represented by a single region. By contrast, Poland, for example, consists of 16 regions. In this connection, blatant violations are taking place in the application of EU structural funds in Latvia. I have received many reports that far from promoting the application of EU funds, officials in the Latvian Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Regional Development are impeding this process by demanding illegal payments from ordinary people in Latvia. The application of funds is not helped either by the fact that Latvia counts as one region. This gives politically committed forces the opportunity to ‘put a brake on’ projects in those local authorities where their political parties are not represented. By the same token, they give the green light to those who are included in their tight circle of corruption. All of this gives no opportunity for a region such as Latgale to make full use of the funds earmarked for the implementation of cohesion policy. A general review of the application and effectiveness of EU structural funds in Latvia needs to be carried out urgently. I am prepared to play an active part in such a review. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This policy, which promotes the balanced development of Europe’s regions, accounts for one third of Community expenditure between 2007 and 2013. It is important to remember some of its principles: Cohesion Policy should continue to be a Community policy, retain substantial financing, ensure decentralised management of funds and multi-level governance, and retain an overall and integrated approach in order to meet the complex challenges which all European regions have to face. Although GDP should remain the main criterion in determining the eligibility of regions for European grants, it has been a struggle to get an ongoing consultation on other criteria. With its humanist tradition, Europe should remain at the forefront of the debate on new ways to assess our fellow citizens’ wealth and well-being. Finally, territorial cooperation deserves particular attention in the next Cohesion Policy. This objective is the embodiment of Europe in the everyday lives of our fellow citizens and makes an ‘ever closer union among the peoples of Europe’ possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to exploit fully the potential for growth of the regions and to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the European Union, it is essential for us to focus on the goal of competitiveness, as well as on cohesion. In particular, we must take into consideration small-scale problems in wealthy Member States. We must also pay particular attention to the needs of mountain areas, as we plan and implement structural measures. The specific geographic features of these areas give rise to particular problems which must be reflected in coordinated strategies and measures. Alongside the urban dimension, the development of rural areas under the umbrella of regional policy is particularly important.

<p class="contents">Firstly, I am keen to remind you of the professionalism and the efforts made by the other regulatory agencies to comply with standards of good administration. These efforts should not be tainted by the bad example set by the European Police College (CEPOL). That is why Parliament must assume its responsibilities as a discharge authority and refuse to grant CEPOL discharge for the financial year 2008 in the circumstances of which we are aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, Parliament cannot accept the serious managerial failings of the former director, and, what is more, it cannot condone the fact that the management board has not assumed its responsibilities by adopting the necessary measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given that the College has been experiencing major difficulties since 2006 and that progress will not be seen until 2014, it is no longer acceptable for the College to need at least nine years to reach an adequate level of good administration.</p>

Thank you for coming. Many of us remember – some of us who are very young will know it from history – the reunification of Germany 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Four great world leaders were there: the President of the United States, George Bush senior, the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher and the President of France, François Mitterrand, and, of course, the foreign ministers of the four countries, negotiating the reunification treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the foreign ministers is today with us. I am very glad to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Roland Dumas. We are very glad to see you.</p>
<p class="contents">We also greet both German leaders at that time: the Chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Kohl and the Prime Minister of East Germany, Lothar de Maizière. Welcome to the European Parliament, 20 years later.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions played a very important role in German reunification. I should also like to say on behalf of all of us: welcome home, Enrique Barón Crespo, former President of the European Parliament. Enrique, it is your home! Thank you for coming.</p>
<p class="contents">And last, but certainly not least, the President of the European Commission in those times, President Jacques Delors. We are very glad to see you. We are very grateful and we remember very well your speeches from those times. You were a great supporter of German unity and it was very important for all of us. There would be no reunification of Europe without the reunification of Germany. Those days were momentous for our continent and we can be proud of it and we will forever remember those days.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a great honour for me to be able to speak to you on this occasion today in the European Parliament. This makes it clear that the reunification of Germany was by no means just a national matter, but also a fundamental European issue. I could even say that by unifying Germany, we have put an end to the misguided nationalism of the European peoples. Therefore, I want to use the opportunity presented by this anniversary and my speech to call on all the people of Europe to strive to achieve all of the things that unite us. Today, 7 October, is an appropriate day for this occasion because it marks the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) 61 years ago. For 40 years, the Day of the Republic was celebrated lavishly and even ostentatiously on 7 October.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I became Prime Minister in order to abolish the GDR and to lead the East Germans into unity. At no point did we have the opportunity to resolve the open German question except in the context of European unity. The European Union, based on the foundations of the Treaty of Rome, has shown that the countries of Europe have learnt the right lessons from the horrors of two world wars. In 1957, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer ensured that the treaties enshrined the full membership of the East Germans in the case of reunification. This turned the intention behind the preamble to the German constitution, which refers to acting on behalf of those who have been prevented from participating, into a practical policy. As a result, the German question always remained on the agenda, because it was also one of the keys to overcoming the division of Europe. The two things are inextricably linked: the war which was started and lost by Germany and the Iron Curtain which divided Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the Iron Curtain were the same people who had suffered most under National Socialism. Neither the uprisings in East Berlin in 1953 and in Poland and Hungary in 1956, nor the Prague Spring of 1968, succeeded in seriously shaking the foundations of communist rule. However, from this moment on, many people across the Eastern bloc states knew that the system that we lived under could not be reformed, but only overcome. This insight represented a bleak hope which we continued to cherish in the face of difficult circumstances and the behaviour of those in power, but which most people, including me, believed would not be fulfilled in their lifetimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom had no voice. It was a time of oppressive silence and paralysis. However, all of this changed in October 1978 with the election of a Polish cardinal as Pope. His faith and his words alone unsettled the intolerant regimes. Firstly, the Polish people and then the whole world realised that this man said what he believed and believed what he said. John Paul II was the first conspicuous sign of the winds of change which would blow across Europe from then on and which, in 1989, would become a storm of upheaval.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The strikes in Danzig in 1980 and the founding of the first free trade union in the Eastern bloc made it clear that a process had been started that could no longer be stopped. The decisive factor in all of this is that none of the peoples were fighting just for themselves. Anyone who called communism into question was doing so on behalf of everyone. Perhaps that is an ironic result of internationalism. Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Lech Wałęsa not only changed their own world, but also ours. We Germans have a great deal to thank the Polish people for.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, we should also remember the names of other figures who were representative of many people. I will only mention Andrei Sakharov and Václav Havel, who had already pulled stones out of the wall in Berlin long before it actually fell in 1989.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like once again to emphasise our respect and gratitude towards Hungary which was the first country to be brave enough to open its borders.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was a time when people acted on behalf of one another, because of their longing for freedom. This upheaval was a genuine joint effort and its most important result should and must be a lasting European community. Therefore, we should see these experiences as a challenge to search in Europe from now on for the things which unite us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will not forget how John Paul II in his speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1996 said, looking back, that people had been separated from one another by walls and lethal borders. In this situation, the Brandenburg Gate in November 1989 bore witness to the fact that people were shaking off and destroying the yoke of oppression. The closed Brandenburg Gate stood as a symbol of separation. When it was finally opened, it became a symbol of unity and a sign of the fact that the call in the German constitution for the completion of the unity of Germany had been achieved in freedom. Now, people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom. I would like to add to what he said, if I may do so as a Protestant from Brandenburg and a descendant of the Huguenots, that with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of European unity. We Germans would not be doing justice to our national unity if we did not see it as a contribution to the unity of Europe, following the historical events which I have outlined here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The first and the only free elections to the East German Volkskammer on 18 March 1990 resulted in a parliament which represented a true cross-section of the population and expressed the vitality and persuasive power of democracy as a form of government. A total of 93.4% of the electorate turned out to vote in the elections. I believe that this is a record which will not be matched in the near future. No one was left untouched by these elections. History will see them as astonishing proof of the fact that we East Germans, after liberating ourselves in the autumn of 1989, succeeded in introducing democracy to our country in the spring of 1990. The people of the GDR acted confidently and responsibly and did justice to their newly acquired freedom. Democracy and freedom are not simply abstract concepts. They permeate and define all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the 20th anniversary of these elections to the Volkskammer, I said in the Reichstag, and I would like to reinforce this once again here, how important it was that the Volkskammer immediately made it clear to all our neighbours that the changes in the GDR and the reunification of Germany were not a cause for concern. The parliament immediately, and of its own free will, admitted responsibility for the whole of German history. It bowed its head before the victims and guaranteed our Polish neighbours secure borders. It also asked for forgiveness for the GDR’s involvement in crushing the Prague Spring. It did all of this before choosing a new government, because the new era after the end of the Cold War was to be a time of reconciliation, peace and community. This admission of responsibility alone represented the beginning of the work of the only freely elected East German Parliament. Everything that followed was linked to this admission and was the consequence of it, so to speak. This admission remains valid even now that the GDR has come to an end and it represents an obligation to search in everything we do for those things which unite us in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The East German Parliament gave me the responsibility of putting in place the process which would bring about the unity of the two states. I would like to emphasise that all of us at that time were only able to achieve those things that had long since become clear as a result of the people’s enthusiasm for unity. The elections on 18 March 1990 were also a plebiscite on the German question. However, we still had to devote ourselves to drawing up treaties and putting in place regulations covering an almost endless number of problems. All areas of society were subjected to fundamental change. The German states were reintroduced, the separation of powers was re-established, the state under the rule of law was restored and education, the police and the administrative bodies were all democratised. One decisive factor was the reintroduction of local self-government which went back to Stein and Hardenberg’s reform of Prussia and which allowed the people to take part in free local elections on 6 May 1990. We also drew up the major national treaties on the economic, currency and social union, the treaty of unification and, finally, the 2+4 treaty with the Allied powers – I am very pleased to see Roland Dumas here – which we signed in Moscow on 12 December.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In those six months, we achieved a huge amount and we are justified in referring to this as the most hardworking parliament in our history.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain grateful to this day for the fact that all our partners were highly committed comrades-in-arms. There are so many names which I could refer to at this point, but I would just like to mention Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev and George Bush senior. The speech about a common European house was one of the main starting points for Gorbachev’s policy of <span class="italic">glasnost</span> and <span class="italic">perestroika</span>. It finally opened a door to unity for the Germans. For this reason, we should never forget that Russia is an important part of this European house and that our partnership with Russia is essential to our survival.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Atlantic Alliance, George Bush provided special protection for our right to self-determination. I would also like to mention the name of Jacques Delors, who achieved a great deal as President of the European Commission and who provided us with indispensable help in the process of bringing about German unity. He was a true friend to the people of Germany. Many thanks!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I remain certain that the reunification of Germany would not have received such broad acceptance and cooperation if it had not been supported in the old Federal Republic by Helmut Kohl, who is undisputedly a very great European.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Two important things came together here. In an unrivalled act of self-liberation by peaceful means, the East Germans overthrew an oppressive regime and brought down the wall. Through democratic elections, they succeeded in bringing about fundamental change. With heads held high, the East Germans said ‘We are the people’ and then, a few weeks later, ‘We are one people’. Those who achieved so much in such a short time should be full of self-confidence and pride. They have every reason to believe that they can withstand what we are now referring to as a crisis and that they will emerge stronger from every crisis. We have experience of transformation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have also realised that we are part of this great community of European peoples and part of the Atlantic Alliance. Other states and peoples have also defended our freedom and have done everything in their power to help us to achieve unity. Therefore, it is important for us to remind ourselves and future generations that we Germans were ourselves responsible for the defeat and division of our country. We have our friends, neighbours and partners to thank for our unity and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, reunification did not just create the Germany that we know today. It also, of course, brought about fundamental changes in the old Federal Republic and throughout Europe. This process of change is continuing undiminished. Our people and our country were able to stop running round in circles over the German question. Instead, they could seriously dedicate their efforts to achieving the other great objective which is embodied in the German constitution and that is, promoting peace throughout the world by acting as an equal member of a united Europe. Now we want to be, and we are in a position to be, the driving force behind European unity and a guarantor of peace in the world, because we have achieved our unity peacefully, in cooperation with our neighbours, and we largely owe it to those neighbours. However, above all, we see this task as a valuable service provided by our country. This will allow us to put something into practice externally which internally represents the decisive content of democracy. Democracy is much less a type of state and much more a genuine service offered by everyone to the community and for the common good. More than any other type of regime, democracy calls for everyone to take action and to become involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the social market economy, which is more than just an economic system. It requires and encourages a sense of responsibility among all citizens. It puts the common good before self-interest and it uses property in the service of the community, without which it cannot be guaranteed. In one way or another, we must keep saying to ourselves that the important issue is to replace division with participation in our country and in Europe. However, participation does not mean that everyone is given something. Instead it means that everyone can contribute something and needs to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am increasingly concerned about the growing contempt for the rights which form the foundation for our freedom. The authenticity and the power of democracy come solely from the attitude of the citizens. This concept of citizenship is what allows us to live together as a community and encourages us always to search for those things which unite us. We are part of a community of peoples who guarantee the rights of citizens, strive for peace and prosperity and want to live in peace. In my opinion, the continent on which we live will have a positive future if it can find the centre point of these values of justice, democracy, peace and freedom and if it can find the unity which we lost after the Second World War. We spoke about the Western alliance, the Eastern bloc and the East-West conflict; we had East and West Berlin; our world was divided into East and West, but it no longer had a centre. An honest search for the things which unite us is also a search for our centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, it almost makes me feel irritated that all the things which we went without in East Germany and which we longed for over many years are now taken for granted and go almost unnoticed. I am thinking of freedom of travel, of speech, of trade, of the press and of religion. I am thinking of the right to free and fair elections with a secret ballot and the right to codetermination. People nowadays take all of this so much for granted that they hardly notice it any more. There is always a risk that no attention will be paid to these things and that they will not be valued. Sometimes I feel disturbed when I remember how often people tend to gamble away what they have achieved, because they take it for granted and no longer appreciate it. They also make too little effort to expand their achievements.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are often faced with difficult tasks. Now that we have enlarged the European Union, we also need to give it more depth. However, these tasks are still much more appealing than a relapse into conflict. It is so much better to work together to overcome crises and resolve problems than to face them alone.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The greatest disaster for the peoples of Europe would be a return to a lack of unity. For this reason, and in particular on a day like today, let us search for all the things that unite us. The rights and the freedoms which I have referred to form the heart and the centre of our society and of the European Union and our community of values. These are the things which unite us. From this centre comes the decisive and perhaps the only important duty which is imposed on us as citizens of Europe. We should be prepared to defend these rights and freedoms. The defence of freedom lies at the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have learned that freedom is indivisible. It is not possible for one part of a people to be free while the other part lives under an oppressive system, as was the case for us in Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall and of the Iron Curtain in Europe has not only freed the East Germans and almost all the people of Eastern and Central Europe. It has also made the freedom of the whole of Europe complete. For this reason, the peoples of Europe can only find the things that are their own in the truest sense of the word within the community. We must preserve freedom within our community in order to ensure ourselves a positive future.</p>
<p class="contents">The last century, with its climaxes and terrible low points, has taught us one thing. History is not a mysterious destiny that is visited on peoples. History is simply the things which people do. However, it is more difficult to influence people’s actions by calling on them to change than it is by setting them a good example. Those things which apply to individuals also apply to members of parliament, governments and entire peoples. We cannot demand that our citizens take a freedom-loving, democratic approach to life. We have to set them an example. Therefore, I am asking you for just one thing today and I am making an urgent call to the peoples of Europe: Let us search for, promote and defend the things which unite us in everything we do. I am grateful that I was permitted to take on responsibility and that as a citizen I am, of course, still responsible for Brandenburg, which is my home, for a united Germany, the fatherland that I love, and for Europe, whose unity will determine our fate and our future.</p>

<p class="contents">You will have realised that I did not welcome to the European Parliament former President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, because Hans-Gert, you are one of us. You sit here every day and work with us, but we are very glad that we are sitting in your honourable place among us.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have our second honoured speaker, Jacques Delors. First, he was appointed as an advisor to the Prime Minister of France, Jacques Chaban-Delmas. Later, for two and a half years, he was a Member of the European Parliament. Probably not all of us remember that. Later, he was also a Minister of Economy and Finance. He had two terms in office as President of the European Commission. He led the single market project and was a key player in the preparation and implementation of the Maastricht Treaty, which was very important for the whole European Union. He was the founder and the President of the think tank Notre Europe, and some other initiatives.</p>

Delors</span></span>  , <span class="italic">former President of the European Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr de Maizière, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Excellencies, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, barely a year elapsed between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">During the whole of 1989, the peoples of Europe expressed themselves: in Poland, the events that had begun with the Gdańsk strikes in the summer of 1980 led to the Belvedere Agreements between February and April 1989, followed by the first free elections on 4 June 1989; in Czechoslovakia, the people commemorated Jan Palach’s sacrifice by fire; in Hungary, they marked the solemn funeral of Imre Nagy, at last rehabilitated; in Bulgaria, President Zhivkov was forced to stand down; and, of course, in East Germany, increasing numbers of people took part in peaceful demonstrations. The people’s demands were gaining strength and, on 2 May 1989, the opening of the border between Hungary and Austria enabled some East Germans to cross over to the West.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore witnessed a moment in time when history accelerated, and we must admit that it took us all by surprise. Some of us knew intuitively that there were growing imbalances in the communist countries, but no one could have known that the lid would blow off so fast. 1989 was a year of profound change in many parts of the world, with, as I recall, the fall of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile and the Tiananmen uprising in China.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to Europe, the events of 1989 could, at any moment, have triggered brutal repression or resulted in bloody conflict, leading to a period of prolonged instability and threats to peace. This did not happen. This is the second lesson, after the one learned from the popular uprising. We, who have lived through these events, must bear witness to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, new generations must be taught about the events of that period, since they did not experience them first-hand. Today, they live in prosperity and peace, while seeing the tensions and revolts that are shaking the world from afar. Therefore, the only images of violence and hatred they see are through the prism of the media. Yet they must store in their memories the all-important fact that it was thanks to the wisdom of a number of world leaders in the years 1989 and 1990 that Europeans were able to live through a transition that was admittedly emotional, but free of any significant bloodshed and dangerous contamination.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will not name all those leaders – Mr de Maizière has already done so – whose calm under pressure and whose wisdom I have just lauded, for fear of forgetting someone, offending sensibilities, or being misunderstood. Some of them, I should add, have unfortunately suffered the ingratitude of their peoples and their successors. History, I am sure, will correct these errors and omissions and will shine the light of truth on these events.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us return for a moment to the shock of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. Even before politicians and diplomats had time to catch their breath, the European Community had to respond, if only in terms of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome to which Mr de Maizière has referred. On 11 November, having convened an urgent meeting of the members of the European Commission, I was interviewed on German television and I asserted that the East Germans were free to choose, and that there was a place for them in the European Community. I added, and I quote: ‘We are a great community within which we shall together build our destiny to better harness history in the interest of all.’</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, it was not possible to say more. It was my duty to send a message of welcome and hope to our East German friends. At the same time, I tried to allay the fears and anxieties felt by many people. From that moment on, many meetings were held between leaders across the world, between the United States and the Soviet Union, between the latter and the Europeans, and between East and West Germany and the four allied powers of World War Two, the ‘Two-plus-Four’ Process. Meanwhile, progress was being made in the negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and representatives of the German Democratic Republic, and primarily between Mr de Maizière and Chancellor Kohl.</p>
<p class="contents">This raised many questions, it should be said, within the European Community in light of this radically shifting political landscape. However, the European Community could ultimately only approve and support reunification of the two Germanies, which it did at the European Council meeting held on 24 April 1990 in Dublin. In acting in this way, and in taking note of the assurances given with regard to the lasting and fair nature of the arrangements made in the ’Two-plus-Four’ Process, the Community remained true to the values for which it stands: peace, mutual understanding between peoples, and solidarity, especially with all Germans in the East and in the West. Moreover, I cannot help but think that throughout the dark years, the Community’s very existence, and not just its material prosperity, always stood as a reference point and a beacon for the peoples living under the communist yoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, let me just remind you: the Community was moving in concert with these events. As early as July 1989 – as Mr Dumas will remember, as he was one of the people involved – even before the fall of the Wall, the Commission had persuaded the G7 to adopt a plan to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The spirit of openness and a favourable predisposition towards enlargement had already been formally confirmed. Nevertheless, after the fall of the Wall, the German question, it has to be said, was a major concern. What path would reunited Germany choose?</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 November 1989, on the initiative of Mr Mitterrand, an extraordinary European Council met to pave the way for regular consultations between the two Germanies and their partners. A long presentation by Chancellor Kohl summed up the situation which, of course, was still necessarily in flux. History had begun on its accelerated course.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament was also very active and attentive during this time. Its debates reflected the questions being asked about the future of Germany and the risk, feared by many MEPs, of a slowdown in the European integration process, after the boost given by the Single European Act of 1987. On 28 November 1989, Parliament adopted a very important resolution affirming, and I quote: ‘All European peoples, including the Polish people, have, in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act, the right to live within secure borders as currently defined.’ In this way, the European Parliament referred to one of the most difficult debates, which was resolved by maintaining the Oder-Neisse border.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 January 1990, I stood before the European Parliament as President of the European Commission and stated that, and I quote: ‘East Germany is a separate case. It belongs within the Community, if that is what it wants.’ This prospect led your Parliament to set up a temporary commission to study the impact of the German reunification process on the European Community. That commission, which was composed, I must stress, of highly experienced individuals including several ministers for foreign affairs, effectively dispelled doubts about the integration of the East German <span class="italic">Länder</span>, and paved the way for it. This is a useful reminder for sceptics of all persuasions that, thanks to the European Parliament, the concept of a pluralist and living democracy is not a vain hope but a reality. The commission demonstrated it on that occasion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, we should not underestimate the achievements and influence of European integration, regardless of the obstacles standing in its way. Of course, I will not attempt to single out the most important facts and ideas that were able to influence this great liberation movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly what comes first is the people’s ability to stand up to oppression, to express their thirst for freedom, and to quietly display their courage. However, it would be remiss of me not to recall the appeals made by John Paul II, and particularly his call made to the Polish people at a critical juncture: ‘Have no fear!’ Nor can I forget West Germany’s firm but open and generous policy towards the GDR during the years leading up to the fall of the Wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom triumphed, but with freedom come obligations. The treaty on the reunification of Germany presented two challenges. The first was for the people of West and East Germany to understand each other. This was met with great presence of mind, understanding and generosity. The second was economic and social, and equally difficult to meet. It required a tremendous effort in the form of massive annual transfers, from the West to the East, of resources amounting to 4-5% of West Germany’s national product, or, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 1 400 billion over 20 years. This is without mentioning the other contributions in the form of technical assistance, which was required to restructure the East German economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A single figure illustrates the scale of this achievement: over a twenty-year period, per capita income in the GDR went from 40% to 73% of the West Germans’ income. The effort will continue over the years to come thanks to the ongoing payment of the solidarity tax – if I am not mistaken, it will continue until 2019. The Germans themselves agree to this. Work still needs to be done to change mindsets as much as economic and social structures.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the European Community contributed by extending economic and social cohesion policy, which MEPs know well, to the Eastern <span class="italic">Länder</span>. While the sums pledged were not on a par with the efforts made by the Germans, the European contributions clearly indicated East Germany’s status as a fully fledged participant in the European adventure, the increased human and technical exchanges and the regular dialogue between the European Commission and the leaders of the new <span class="italic">Länder</span>. It had been my wish for the Community to do more, but the German leadership, worried about how its partners would react, asked me not to take the Structural Fund effort any further.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 20 years later, at a time when, the financial crisis aside, many people are questioning European integration, the 27 Member States are faced with an historic responsibility: to deepen European integration, or to live day to day as a result of compromises that may well be necessary but that do not bode well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, as we joyfully celebrate German reunification, how can we fail to ask Germany what future it sees for Europe? Reunified Germany is the economic powerhouse of the 27 countries that make up the Union. To cite just one figure, Germany produces 25% of the total GDP of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). I refer to the EMU because, whether we like it or not, it is the strongest link between the European nations that share the same currency, with the rights, but also the obligations, that this entails. Many people in Europe perhaps tend to forget this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In geopolitical terms, Germany is today poised between the European Union and the rest of the large European continent. This is a strong and, in many ways, attractive position, which raises many questions both within and outside of Germany. The Germans themselves agree with this view, as the White Paper on security in Germany clearly shows. I quote: ‘An important role in the future shaping of Europe, and beyond, falls to united Germany because of its size, population figures, economic power and geographical location at the heart of the continent.’</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore no longer in the pre-1989 period, when Germany showed restraint and tact, for reasons that everybody could understand and even be thankful for. This very restraint caused successive German governments to take the lead in European integration, especially when it came to abandoning the mighty Deutschmark – and I say the mighty Deutschmark because it is 10 Marks and is the symbol of Germany’s rebirth – in exchange for the euro, for the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">These remarks, far from being nostalgic, are an appeal by one of Europe’s activists, and are directed not only at Germany, whose reunification we are celebrating, but at all the Member States. Are the values handed down to us by the founding fathers of Europe still meaningful? Do they still prevail? The legacy we have been given has more to do with why we want to live alongside one another than with the treaties, which are merely necessary institutional agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would not wish to end on this slightly pessimistic note, with this question mark hanging over matters. No, emphatically not. What I retain in my memory and in my heart is that night of 3 October, when the President of the European Parliament, Mr Barón Crespo, and I had the pleasure and honour of being invited to that memorable evening gathering in the former Reichstag. The leaders of West and East Germany enthusiastically came together in an atmosphere marked by solemnity and joy. All Europeans would have shared that deep emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">After the ceremony I wanted to experience what a nation was feeling by going out on to the streets of Berlin. There, too, I saw only solemnity and joy; there was no fanfare or ostentatious demonstrations. It was a quiet night that everyone was savouring by reflecting on the separations of the past, on the anguish of families torn apart by an arbitrary act of history; a quiet night during which I thought of our Europe, freed from hatred and conflict, a Europe that I wanted to be at the same time united, strong and generous.</p>
<p class="contents">You will surely agree that so much remains to be done to consolidate our achievements and progress into the future.</p>

Naturally, my group, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), thought that that approach was quite right. To be precise, the dossier on the Police College reads from beginning to end like a Hercule Poirot whodunit. Poor management, an accounting system vulnerable to fraud, many financial irregularities and, in particular, ‘creative’ budgetary spending, unauthorised use of funds, and the list goes on. In fact, the situation was so bad that, in the end, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, was forced to step in.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a positive thing that an investigation is under way and that action is being taken against fraud. However, would it not have been better if we had prevented the fraud right from the start? How could this have been allowed to happen? Why were the controls in place so obviously inadequate? Again, we have a situation where our citizens can only look on and shake their heads. On behalf of Dutch citizens, we explicitly request that you put an end to this entire European police puppet show as soon as possible and simply leave real police work to the Hercule Poirots of individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the first quarter of 2010, 1 244 women were raped. There are an average of 14 rapes per day that we know about, because over and above these figures, the numbers of unreported cases are huge. The fact that this has continued without strong condemnation from the international community is appalling, and Europe, too, has a particular responsibility when it comes to Congo.</p>

It is scandalous that the international community has turned a blind eye for so long to the attacks that the women and children of Congo are being subjected to.

For this reason, I submitted a written question on this subject in July. The serious incident that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in April is a warning bell that we cannot afford to underestimate. In fact, there is a risk of similar episodes occurring in Europe, too.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 May, a platform in the North Sea, from which 200 million tonnes of petroleum are extracted each year, was evacuated because of a serious accident risk. We must never forget, ladies and gentlemen, that if a disaster of this kind were to occur in a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, its inestimable wealth of biodiversity would be compromised to an unimaginable extent, as Mr Iacolino just highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">According to European Commission data, the oil platforms in our seas produced around 200 million tonnes of petroleum in 2008. These figures are still too high for an economy that must necessarily free itself of fossil fuels. The Danish Government’s pledge to achieve complete independence from these types of energy resources by 2050 has been in the news recently. That decision will entail many difficult decisions, but it must serve as an important benchmark for all of the European Union’s future environmental policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to mention something of which I have personal knowledge. An important professor, a gynaecologist, abandoned his university career and made a financial and professional investment in improving health in Sub-Saharan Africa. He built clinics, in which he operated on women suffering from fistulas following difficult births. After several years, when he had already helped many women, he asked for funding from the European Union in order to expand his work. The response was negative and the reasoning absurd. He had apparently failed to fulfil the requirement to support sexual and reproductive health in his projects. I do not know what could support the sexual and reproductive health of women more than curing fistulas in the area of the genital and excretory organs. I therefore logically assume that, according to the European institutions, sexual and reproductive health is simply an abortion and anti-conception policy. These are the reasons why I was unable to vote for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I do not support the idea that it is necessary for the European Social Fund to have its own rules.

I would not like to see such a development, and no one who depends on a strong and effective cohesion policy could wish for it. I agree with the European Social Fund having its own rules to the extent that they apply to tasks and the thematic definition of its activities. On the other hand, rules in the areas of geographic eligibility, aims, guidance, monitoring and concrete mechanisms should remain common. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the scrapping of the visa requirement for the citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in December 2009, corresponding decisions regarding Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania have been eagerly awaited. Opening the European Union to further Balkan nations will bring many positive results for all parties concerned. Firstly, this is an unprecedented improvement for ordinary citizens who can now experience the European Union for themselves and can travel freely in all the Member States. Secondly, this is another extremely significant step towards the aim of stabilising the situation in the region and creating a positive climate for further reforms and the future integration of all Balkan countries into the European Union. However, we should also take the corresponding decisions on visa requirements for the citizens of Kosovo. The inhabitants of this country should not remain the only totally isolated nation in the Balkans, and the privileges linked with free travel throughout Europe should also be extended to them. I am extremely happy with the initiative taken by the European Parliament to abolish the visa regime for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. This is a further step towards the inclusion of the Balkan countries in Europe, and it has my strong support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the Commission proposal was first introduced, the European Parliament was consulted and agreed two amendments, replacing references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also pointing to a high standard of social protection as an objective of the European Union, present in the existing Regulation No 859/2003. Both these amendments have been incorporated into the position of the Council at first reading of 26 July 2010 as recitals 4 and 7. The Council is proposing a small number of amendments: it has included some recitals relating to the participation of certain Member States under the proposal’s legal basis of Article 79(2)(b). (Recitals 17, 18, 19.) Regrettably, Denmark is not participating in the coordination arrangements for third-country nationals.

Unfortunately, very little use is made of the EGF: of the EUR 500 million in funding made available through it this year, only 11% was requested to fund aid plans for workers who have been made redundant. Given the high rate of unemployment, this situation is worrying and incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress the fact that, following successive warnings and reports, an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused ESF funds has been set up. Given the effects of this crisis, which are especially being felt in the textiles sector, I would stress the importance of this plan of EUR 1 844 700 in support of the 703 workers made redundant from 82 companies in Galicia’s textiles sector. In contrast to this initiative of the Spanish Government, I find it regrettable that the Portuguese Government has not intervened in this way in the districts of Braga and Viana do Castelo, which border Galicia and have high rates of unemployment because of successive companies going out of business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Altogether, several hundred more workers have been made redundant. It is worth remembering once again that this sector is also enduring a serious crisis in Portugal, where it is suffering the effects of the liberalisation of world trade particularly intensely, while none of the actions needed to safeguard it have been taken. These effects may now become even worse following the decision to intensify the liberalisation measures for Asian textiles. This step was taken on the pretext of providing humanitarian aid to Pakistan, whereas in reality, it fulfils the desires of the major importers in the European Union. Every new application to mobilise this fund increases the urgency of the measures that we have been advocating, which are aimed at combating unemployment effectively, boosting economic activity, eradicating jobs with no security, and reducing working hours without cutting pay. These measures also involve fighting company relocations and, overall, require a complete break with the neoliberal policies that are visibly causing an economic and social disaster in the countries of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the reasons is principally a lack of experience with the processes of the fund and the long period of financial uncertainty when awaiting the decision of the budget authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the simplified procedures for assessments and decision making introduced at the end of 2009 will simplify and speed up the submission of applications for support from the fund and will accordingly bring effective assistance to employees who have lost jobs as a result of changes in the structure of world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the mobilisation of the EGF for granting aid to those made redundant. Trade deregulation in the textiles and clothing industry has brought about far-reaching changes in global trade patterns, with the upshot being a general trend to relocate production outside the EU to countries where production costs are lower, such as China and Morocco. Furthermore, the economic crisis has also triggered a large number of bankruptcies in the textile industry, resulting in a huge wave of redundancies. There were 32 700 redundancies in the Galicia region between 2007 and 2009, including 4 414 in the textiles industry, with women accounting for 80% of the redundancies. I believe that the procedure for allocating these funds must be simplified to make the EGF easy to access for firms affected by the impact of the financial and economic crisis and by the changes in global trade patterns. I must stress the important role played by the EGF in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Lithuania received a total of EUR 2.9 million in aid from the EGF, which was earmarked for workers from the construction and household goods manufacturing sectors that were badly affected by the crisis. However, the fund still has to prove its worth. Set up as a rapid counter-measure, now the EGF has slowed and become complicated due to bureaucracy. The main drawback is the necessary mobilisation of the fund. On average it takes 294 days to approve applications. As the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> wrote this week, more than 37 000 workers throughout Europe are still waiting for aid from the fund. To date, only EUR 140 million of the EGF’s total amount available (EUR 2 billion) has been paid out. The fund’s money is also distributed unevenly. Only 6% of payments are granted to projects in countries where the gross domestic product is lower than the EU average. The EGF must be more flexible if we want to avoid drowning in uncertainty.

On 8 September 2009, Denmark submitted the request for financial assistance for mobilising the EGF in the case of the Danfoss Group, which made 1 443 employees redundant. The economic and financial crisis has led to a slump in demand for mechanical and electronic equipment. Trends in the machinery and equipment production sector changed dramatically in the EU in Q4 2008 in both Denmark and Germany, where falls in production in excess of 25% were seen. Sales of Danfoss mechanical and electronic equipment fell in 2008 by up to 52% in Europe, 48% in the US and 23% in the Asia-Pacific region. Due to the competition from Asian firms in this sector, whose wage costs are significantly lower than those in the EU, the Danfoss Group has gradually relocated its production from Denmark to third countries, which has had a serious impact on the labour market. I call on the Commission to develop an ambitious, green industrial policy, capable of guaranteeing the EU’s global competitiveness and preserving jobs in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe, namely, that the entire process, from drawing up applications through to processing and obtaining the final decision of the budget authority, has so far been rather cumbersome and complex, according to the experience of many countries. For example, in 2009, the contributions requested from the fund were, on average, around EUR 5 552 700, and 30 of the applications submitted by 13 Member States related to 17 branches. However, the budget authority last year approved 10 financial contributions from the EGF amounting, in total, to EUR 52 349 000, which represents just 10.5% of the maximum annual sum that can be used from this fund. One of the reasons is principally a lack of experience with the processes of the fund, and the long period of financial uncertainty when awaiting the decision of the budget authority. I believe that the simplified procedures for assessments and decision making introduced at the end of 2009 will simplify and speed up the submission of applications for support from the fund and will accordingly bring effective assistance to employees who have lost jobs as a result of changes in the structure of world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 8 September 2009, Denmark submitted the request for a financial contribution of EUR 1 213 508 (65% of the total budget required) for supporting 139 employees made redundant from Linak A/S. These redundancies coincided with another large wave of redundancies from the Danfoss Group in Sønderborg, southern Denmark. I believe that Member States are responsible for supporting the reintegration of every redundant worker into employment. The EGF offers Member States the opportunity to support workers affected by the global financial and economic crisis and the major changes in global trade patterns. In Romania, 381 296 workers lost their jobs between March 2008 and March 2010, including 13 667 in the county of Galaţi alone. I think that other Member States, too, which have not requested the EGF’s mobilisation so far, including Romania, must examine and follow the example of the states which have used the EGF to support redundant workers due to the economic and financial crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the arguments set forth in the report justify this decision. However, I am surprised that the annual accounts have not been approved, even if they are not subject to significant observations on the part of the European Court of Auditors. Whereas the report by my colleague, Véronique Mathieu, approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control, proposes three votes (refusal to grant discharge, closing of the accounts and resolution), I find it odd that in actual fact, only two items were put to the plenary vote: the discharge and the resolution. Very strange ... to my mind, nothing prevented the accounts from being closed. We end up with a bizarre accounting situation where, in October 2010, the 2008 accounts are not closed, the financial year 2009 is over and that of 2010 only has a few weeks left.

Let us hope that the investigation being carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) will be comprehensive and scrupulous and will help to bring more clarity to the matter. However, this issue is related to a much greater problem – to the frequent lack of integrity and professionalism within police and security forces throughout Europe. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have reported a particularly high number of cases throughout Europe where the police exceeded its powers and used illegal investigation methods. In most cases, institutions failed to carry out investigations and punish lawbreakers according to international standards, and this increases the level of impunity. Often, victims become easy targets because of their minority status, whether it is due to their ethnicity or their political views. Strong police forces need a strong and honest Rule of Law and judicial independence. The European Police College has noble objectives: to promote common European policing standards, cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and uphold the rule of law and legislation. Whether it is through this or another forum, the most important thing is that these objectives are achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I come from a country which lived for almost half a century under the harshest Communist regime without any right to free travel. Subsequently, Romania has needed 15 years to persuade Europe that its citizens are not second-class and should enjoy a fundamental human right. The EU does not and never has advocated artificially putting up partitions, but has brought all Europeans to the same table by dismantling borders. The European Parliament has constantly promoted the notion of abolishing the regime imposing visa requirements because it is aware of the psychological impact which the current situation has on those who are still obliged to purchase visas to go and visit family members settled in EU countries, to go and study, or simply to travel. It is high time, 21 years after the reunification of Europe, to put an end to visas for inhabitants of Europe who would like to travel within the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The guarantee that the European Union will extend visa exemption to the two countries, especially to Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the very near future, at the beginning of autumn 2010, will reduce the risk of greater political and ethnic instability, strengthen political and economic cooperation in the region, and increase popular support for the EU and the prospects for European integration, as well as broaden the horizons of its people and restrain extremist and anti-European sentiment. I voted in favour of this resolution for visa exemption so that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania could benefit from this as quickly as possible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who today claim to be rewarding the Balkan countries are the same ones who, yesterday, were doing all they could to destroy Yugoslavia and dismantle its peoples’ achievements. The hands of the major EU and NATO powers are stained with the crimes they committed there, in an operation that succeeded in creating hatred and warfare between peoples that had long before decided to unite their wills in order to build their country. We therefore do not support the dismantling of what remains of Yugoslavia, promoted by those who want to get their hands on its wealth, exploit its peoples and make use of its geostrategic location, an old dream of big capital in the EU.

In Albania, no legal system has yet been established to counter organised crime and the very high levels of corruption. The criminal justice system faces similar problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the level of cooperation between the police and legal authorities is very poor. The visa policy allows a certain amount of monitoring and selection of who is allowed to enter from third countries.

That decision represented important progress towards the European integration of these countries, which have demonstrated that they are capable of embarking on serious reform processes. With today’s vote on the Fajon report, we have accepted the Commission’s proposal to abolish the mandatory element for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina also. In fact, I believe that a differentiated approach would have risked exacerbating the ethnic and political divisions characteristic of the region. The only region not included in the visa liberalisation process is Kosovo. This exception is substantially due to the existing issues regarding the recognition of that country’s independence, which I hope can soon be resolved. In conclusion, I must point out that the abolition of visas, which is the objective of this report, concerns a crucial aspect of people’s lives, in that it allows them to actually exercise their right to freedom of movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This document describes the illegal immigrants coming from the Balkans as containing a strong criminal element in terms of drugs, arms and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">While some of these countries remain highly unstable for geopolitical, religious or even ethnic reasons, the report from the socialist, Mrs Fajon, recommends nothing less than abolishing the visa system for all countries in the Western Balkans. Quite apart from the fact that this privilege goes against the Schengen agreements and the very principles of the functioning of the European Union and of the mechanism for joining it, to my mind, it is out of the question to authorise the free movement of persons from countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina or Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">Invoking this ‘fundamental right’ is, in reality, only a ‘hotch-potch’ utopia.

Countless people have used the more liberal visa conditions to travel into the European Union. How many of those people actually went back to their home countries once the period of time granted for their stay had expired, nobody knows. It does not seem to be clear to the people in question that visa liberalisation has nothing to do with jobs or the right of abode. The maths of stemming illegal entry into the EU through a readmission agreement cannot stack up while visa liberalisation continues to be abused. This idea needs to be put paid to. Kosovo, in particular, represents a major problem for us in this regard. The EU has never been able to decide what it thinks more important or what it thinks is correct and proper – territorial integrity or the right of self-determination for peoples – and because we have ignored the problem of multinational states for too long, what we have now is a divided Balkan state. To use a visa agreement in order, indirectly, to almost force recognition of Kosovo in this way, when some Member States have not recognised it, contradicts the principle of subsidiarity and is a violation of national rights, which should be rejected in the strongest possible terms. In light of the above considerations, I voted against the Fajon report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the critical position that the French took during the COREPER meeting on 29 September: having complained that the period between the Commission’s proposal and the assessment was too short, they referred the issue to Parliament and requested more time to evaluate the benchmarks. There are still too many issues unresolved to agree to abolish the requirement for Albanian and Bosnian nationals to possess a visa for entry into the EU. These issues concern, in particular, the fight against corruption and organised crime, the lack of biometric passports, and immigration and border controls. On this last issue, I should remind you that last March, Belgium repatriated several hundred Serbs and Macedonians of Albanian origin who had sought asylum in Europe after visa restrictions had been lifted for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will clearly give a boost to their citizens, giving them the same rights and privileges as their neighbours. The Council should now move swiftly to approve their inclusion. However, we are concerned about the reluctance of some Member States, notably France, to do so. Bosnia’s and Albania’s compliance with the EU criteria for lifting the visa requirement is actually better now than Serbia’s and Macedonia’s at the time they got visa-free travel one year ago. If the Council fails to follow the position of the European Parliament and European Commission, it would be a completely wrong signal to send to the citizens of Bosnia and Albania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have also been making progress, so that as soon as they meet the exemption criteria, they can be granted exemption and come off the negative list. It is essential to decide that a future citizen of the Union has a fundamental right to travel in the European Union. In order to put this liberalisation into practice, it is still necessary to strengthen the fight against organised crime in both countries and to develop a strategy supporting the integration of repatriated nationals, in the case of Albania, and the harmonisation of criminal law according to the Federal Criminal Code, in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ability to travel without needing visas in the near future will contribute to strengthening political and economic cooperation and reducing the risk of tensions in the region. Moreover, EU support will certainly help to broaden people’s horizons. I am voting for the document for the reasons given above. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Information about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is especially alarming as the acts of exceptional brutality being committed are taking place in the vicinity of the UN peacekeeping camp. The 1 244 women raped in just three months of this year by representatives of all the forces involved in this conflict are by no means mere statistics. Each of them is going through their own tragedy. What is even more shocking is that this situation can happen again at any time without them feeling any kind of protection. The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo provides a further argument in favour of officially acknowledging any form of violence based on gender as a crime against humanity and a war crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proliferation of warring movements and the atrocities they have committed make up some of the saddest pages in the history of Africa. The list of tragedies and violations of human rights and justice is being added to so fast that even the best-informed observers cannot keep up properly. The international community was recently alerted to a wave of mass rapes, which we can only find repugnant and which deserve our condemnation and the strongest repudiation. The use of this type of violence as a weapon of war – which, unfortunately, is nothing new – must, even so, elicit from us nothing less than unreserved condemnation and the effective prosecution of those who are physically and morally responsible for it. Congo needs peace and stability, but that will not be achieved unless the perpetrators of the most obscene breaches of human rights, who have been enjoying scandalous impunity, are unequivocally identified and punished as an example to others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN and EU missions have already demonstrated that they are not the solution but part of the problem. Our political group proposed calling for ‘an end to the EUPOL and EUSEC missions to the DRC, which have admittedly made a negative contribution to escalating violence and the situation in the country by training security forces that have been perpetrating crimes against their own civilian population’.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority in this House preferred to reject this proposal and sided with those who want to maintain the conflict and benefit from it. Peace will only be achieved through a political agreement between the various stakeholders, both inside and outside the country. It must, of course, include the countries in the region, particularly Rwanda and Uganda, which are breaching the sovereignty and independence of the DRC and playing an active part in the conflict. Above all, however, it must involve the United States and the European Union, the main beneficiaries of a war economy which sustains itself by selling important minerals used by US and European companies in the production of computer and mobile telephone components. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, the international community, have failed. However, we also failed much closer to home, in our own territory. We always rush to condemn human rights violations outside the European Union and demand that urgent action be taken. However, when attention turns to human rights violations within the EU, the reaction is mostly restrained. The EU will be hit by a huge crisis of confidence if it fails to narrow the gap between its honourable condemnations of crimes committed outside the EU and actions being taken at home in the area of human rights. It should not be this way. The Treaty of Lisbon brought new opportunities to strengthen human rights, especially the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now mandatory, not just for EU institutions, but also for Member States. Thus, it is within our capabilities to fix this human rights vacuum within the EU, but we must act now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violation of human rights and of international law continues to this very day, and is spreading across the region at an alarming rate. The European Union has taken on a long-term commitment towards the entire African region of the Great Lakes, part of which lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our efforts towards peace and stability in the region, however, have so far brought no tangible results. Our resolution of today is another appeal by this Parliament to end attacks on civilian populations in the eastern provinces of Congo, and for the victims to be provided with basic health, social, humanitarian and legal assistance. Every armed conflict has a political solution, but there has to be a will to find such a solution. The security and stability of eastern Congo therefore rests primarily on the shoulders of the Congolese Government. Economic and humanitarian assistance is important, but it is not enough in itself. I am pleased that this Parliament, through the vote of its Members, has again confirmed in clear terms that our commitment to Congo includes a clear statement on the defence of human rights every time they are violated in the region. I have therefore supported the submitted resolution, and I trust that the European Commission will find effective mechanisms for putting the recommendations from the resolution into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of countries which have stopped using this form of punishment for good has risen to 95. In fact, its regular use has been restricted to two regions in the world: Asia and North Africa. The UN resolutions on the implementation of a global moratorium have made a considerable contribution to achieving these results. The EU also continues to provide the largest source of funding to organisations campaigning against capital punishment. However, I believe that the specific initiatives promoted by these organisations must gain the necessary political support. As the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution provides significant support in this respect, I voted in favour of it. However, in spite of the positive progress, 58 countries retain the death penalty, while the statistics for the number of people condemned to this punishment are alarming. Last year, more than 700 people were executed, which is not counting the several thousand people assumed to have been condemned to death in China. I therefore would like to highlight the need to increase efforts in influencing international public opinion. Even in some EU Member States, a large proportion of citizens would agree to the introduction of capital punishment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that many states still apply the death penalty, the cruellest, most inhumane and degrading form of punishment of all, especially to women and even minors, is beyond comprehension. What makes it all the more difficult to understand is that there is no kind of evidence to show that the death penalty discourages crimes more than other forms of punishment. It is important for the European Union to continue its measures supporting cooperation between states because this is the only way, through collaboration, education and raising awareness, of enabling us to fulfil the desire to abolish the death penalty worldwide. The key to achieving the European Union’s most desired human rights objective also lies in the activities of the non-governmental sector which highlights unfair trials that scandalously impose harsh sentences, like the one handed down in Iran to a boy who was only 16 at the time he committed his alleged crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are strongly committed to working towards the abolition of the death penalty everywhere and are striving to achieve universal acceptance of this principle. According to Amnesty International, there are still 58 countries in the world that have not abolished it, 18 of which carried out executions in 2009. China alone executed more people than all the other countries put together. The only country in Europe that continues to apply the death penalty is Belarus. The European Parliament was the first European institution to launch this campaign, in the early 1980s, and the EU is currently the main institutional actor in the fight against the death penalty, as well as the main source of funding for such efforts.

Executions or death sentences have never resulted in improved crime figures, which is why the European Union should promote alternative sentences at the disposal of criminal justice systems when dealing with countries that still apply this punishment, which is contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Parliament has also expressed deep concern about the application of the death penalty to minors and to people suffering from mental or intellectual impairment and has called for it to be brought to an end swiftly and permanently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It therefore deserves our vehement condemnation and everyone’s unreserved commitment to its eradication I hope that more countries will join the group of states that have abandoned this practice forever. Irrespective of the seriousness of the specific individual actions which, in theory, might motivate or even justify such a sentence, I believe that the abolition of the death penalty represents an enormous step forward for civilisation and a distinctive feature of penal systems, such as those of the Union’s Member States, that seek to separate justice from revenge. It is essential to maintain this non-vindictive provision and to ensure that even the worst of criminals must be treated with dignity, even if they do not deserve it. Indeed, simply taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth would be unworthy of our common heritage of respect for human life, which is so often overlooked by our political decision makers. At this time, my thoughts are also with all those who are not guaranteed even a semblance of a fair trial and who are killed randomly or deliberately by the most barbaric methods in the most merciless circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a great amount of work to be done in supporting de facto abolitionist countries codifying such practice in law, in reducing the number of death penalty sentences handed down and carried out in other countries, and in supporting campaigns to repeal death sentences, particularly where trial outcomes are not recognised as legally sound.

The European Union is completely opposed to application of the death penalty, regardless of the circumstances. The actions of the EU in this field form the chief priority of its external human rights policy. The EU has consistently called for abolition of this penalty all over the world, and this is why, to the greatest extent possible, it provides financial support for civil society organisations acting to abolish the death penalty.

This event has shown that strict environmental protection measures must be adhered to when oil is extracted from the deep sea. Europe must, however, remain competitive in this sector and continue prospecting for gas so that it can diversify its energy sources. I therefore support the adoption of new safety principles, the application of strict and rigorous common standards and the establishment of solidarity funds to compensate victims for any damage caused. The urgent need for such measures is also a result of the geomorphological nature of our seas, such as the Mediterranean, and of the drilling currently under way on the Libyan and Egyptian coasts. If there were an oil spill, it would cause an environmental disaster that we would struggle to overcome, with extremely serious consequences for the economy and the environment of many European countries. In conclusion, I do not support the proposal for a moratorium, because I believe that agreements with third countries and their oil companies would be more effective. This course of action would make it easier to export safety standards and invest in prevention and technological research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that EU waters also border countries that are not part of the European Union, whereby EU legislation does not require them to comply with the relevant provisions governing liability and the remedying of damage, the European Commission must develop accident prevention policies for oil rigs and extend the scope of the SEVESO II Directive to oil rigs. The current environmental liability legislation contains several important gaps and, therefore, I believe that some new legislative provisions need to be introduced to take into account all inherent risks associated with off-shore exploitation, and liability in the event of oil accidents needs to be properly regulated. Due to the absence of a compensation fund for oil disasters, the Commission must include compulsory financial security provisions under the Environmental Liability Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An early demonstration of what will happen in 2080 as a result of these activities can only serve as a warning to stop the clock of disasters that is set for the whole world – no one is exempted, not even ourselves. There is no doubt that there are liabilities for deep sea drilling which, until recently, would never have been taken into account, but the threat of disasters similar to that in the Gulf of Mexico cannot leave us indifferent. It is essential today for the European Union to strengthen and harmonise throughout the 27 Member States safety levels pertaining to oil exploration and extraction activities, not only for existing platforms, but also for those that will be taken out of service. Secondly, we must identify and regulate operator liability, beginning with excluding the possibility of leasing installations to third parties. For this reason, I agree with what the rapporteur has stated and I want direct intervention by the Commission and the Council to bring about clarity, transparency, uniformity and, hence, safety within our territory and on this specific subject, on which, ladies and gentlemen, we must never drop our guard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the North-East Atlantic, the conditions at depth are similar to those in the Gulf of Mexico and hence, the risks are similar, too. The safety debate in Europe is all the more important in light of the fact that the majority of oil drilling and exploration takes place in the waters of the North Sea and that, in view of the tightening up of the safety requirements in the United States and contrary to the obligations of the OSPAR Convention, the neighbouring states were not able to reach an agreement. It is even more important because, in times of high oil prices, it becomes particularly profitable to develop poorly accessible oilfields and to extract under the most adverse conditions, such as from deeper and deeper depths.

Secondly, increased safety monitoring of existing installations or those being built is essential.

These standards must, in my opinion, guarantee both a sustainable energy supply to Europe and the security and durability of offshore activities. We all remember the terrible pictures of the black sea in the Gulf of Mexico, the dreadful loss of human life, the distress of the citizens affected by the disaster and the considerable damage resulting from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig. It is for this reason that I renew my appeal to create a genuine European civil protection force capable of being deployed rapidly and effectively following disasters of such seriousness. Offshore exploitation and extraction in deep water are essential for the rarefaction of petroleum. However, their impact on the environment must be controlled, and we must guarantee that they do not constitute a future threat to marine and coastal areas and to biodiversity. This is a major challenge for the international and environmental image of the European Union, which is producing very positive results in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is estimated that the global extinction rate is between 100 and 1 000 times higher than the usual natural rate, and human agency is chiefly responsible. It is very disappointing that the 2010 targets for ending the loss of biodiversity have not been achieved. Agricultural land accounts for 45% of the EU total and is a valuable habitat containing a wealth of biodiversity. The agricultural sector has contributed to EU biodiversity, and many animal and plant species now depend on the agricultural sector and farming practices. For example, it is sheep and cattle grazing that maintain the diversity of flora of open grassland. Biodiversity issues must be taken into account when farming practices are being implemented. Assistance and support must be provided for agri-environmental measures to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity. The importance of the agriculture sector to the environment must be addressed in Nagoya, and this issue should be central when the future and budget of the CAP are being discussed from now on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the current situation, where biological diversity has declined by 30% over the last 40 years, and future projections that the rate of biodiversity loss will accelerate ten-fold, it is necessary to take decisive action now to preserve biodiversity and promote the sustainable use of biodiversity. Biodiversity loss poses a threat to food security, and exacerbates energy depletion and climate change. In order to avoid the negative impact of these processes, the Commission and the Member States must cooperate by preparing a sustainable EU strategy on biodiversity preservation, which would be reconciled with the objectives of combating poverty, managing waste sustainably and reducing climate change. Adequate financing will unavoidably be required to implement the planned actions and strategies. It is likely that public sector support will be insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to attract investment from the private sector and to find new sources of financing. Furthermore, while approving the new multiannual financial framework, it is necessary to consider the plans drafted and to ensure they have the required financing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only if we have clear ideas on objectives and proposals can we really play a decisive role in the global agreements that will be reached.

In order to achieve ambitious goals, it is necessary, as quickly as possible, to adopt concrete indicators based on scientific data in order to measure progress towards the strategic targets. Studies conducted to date estimate that the welfare loss arising from the loss of biodiversity is currently around EUR 50 billion per year (just under 1% of GDP), rising to EUR 14 trillion in 2050. Therefore, the European Union considers this problem to be extremely urgent. I endorse the conviction that many links exist between protecting the climate, achieving the Millennium Development Goals and halting biodiversity loss. Steps taken to protect biodiversity have a positive effect on climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. I agree with the appeal contained in the resolution for support for efforts to enhance synergies and links between biodiversity and climate policies. However, in order to help prevent these global problems, there is a need to increase drastically the global funding for biodiversity protection, notably through existing funding sources, as well as new and innovative sources, including new and innovative market-based instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, the loss of biodiversity continues even though, as a result of growing awareness, ecological zones called ‘Natura 2000’ were set up covering almost 18% of European territory. What should we expect at Nagoya between 18 and 29 October 2010? At best, that the European Union speaks with one voice. It must also have the courage to speak about topics that can provoke anger, even with Japan, the host country, which cannot continue to use unsustainable and particularly barbarous methods of fishing for whales and dolphins with impunity.

However, as a result of human activity, the process of biodiversity loss around the world is advancing with increasing speed. Symptoms of this include mass deforestation, shrinking fish stocks and the disappearance of yet more species. Scientists estimate that 15-40% of species may disappear by the end of the 21st century. We should be aware that biodiversity loss has an adverse effect on the action of ecosystems and the services they deliver, such as the provision of food, purification of water, fertilisation of soil, protection against floods and production of energy. Biodiversity is endangered by many factors, for example, climate change, uncontrolled suburban development and invasive alien species. However, I would like to concentrate on one specific issue. I am thinking of agriculture, which is often cited as a factor which poses a threat to biodiversity. Certainly, one can agree that industrial agriculture is not environmentally friendly. I think, however, that a significantly greater threat to the environment is the discontinuation of agricultural activity. We have been seeing an intensification of this process recently. The ever lower profitability of agricultural production, which is caused, among other factors, by price fluctuations, means that people are turning away from agriculture, and this is causing the disappearance of life over large areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe must, in fact, play more of a part in this phase of the negotiations so that we can avoid a possible penalisation of the European economic system and distortions of competition. Compared to the US system, the European system is mainly financed by bank lending, but the financial crisis of the last few years in Europe and the resulting lack of liquidity have led to a drastic reduction in loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of our economy. I voted in favour of this document because I am convinced that in the negotiations on the reform of Basel II, the EU must strive to obtain equal terms with the United States on accounting standards, parity of requirements between commercial banks and investment banks, an unambiguous definition of liquidity and greater transparency with regard to the role of rating agencies. In order to cope with future periods of stress, we must henceforth provide ourselves with a greater quantity and quality of capital and greater liquidity.

Developing high quality liquidity standards is therefore a key part of the crisis response. However, these should be sufficiently differentiated in order to take account of the particularities of banks’ business models and their respective risk profiles. In view of this, the forthcoming European Banking Authority should play a leading role in drawing up and implementing measures relating to capital requirements and the rules on countercyclical buffer standards at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The failures of those banks have brought on a crisis which continues to severely hurt citizens around the world. Citizens have paid twice, with costs of a taxpayer bailout followed by the pain of recession and spending cuts. To prevent a repeat of such a crisis requires a fundamental revision of the financial regulatory framework and this must include a stronger capital framework for banks. Proposals to improve the Capital Requirements Directive are therefore central to creating stable and responsible banks. This report endorses the aims and proposals set out by the G20 and the Basel Committee, to ensure banks hold sufficient amounts of capital of a suitable quality, and that they have the liquidity and stable funding necessary to withstand tough market conditions. Labour MEPs are voting for this report as it backs the reform process, but we do not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel. We encourage further study of the impact of the measures where appropriate, but with a view to ensuring full, tough and timely international implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The own-initiative report on which we voted today focuses on a subject that I believe somehow falls within this new architecture and which I consider decisive for any economy. Defining the quantity and quality of own funds is certainly a matter of great sensitivity which needs to be analysed in terms of its impact – particularly on Europe’s economic recovery – and its general context. Since our businesses are financed primarily by the banking sector, which is one of the pillars of the economy, it is crucial in my view that the banks should manage their risks and profits within a long-term prudential perspective. Moreover, I believe these concerns should be discussed proactively and in terms of transatlantic cooperation. I voted in favour of this report since I agree with its overall content, which I see as one more step towards establishing new Union mechanisms for planning, coordination and supervision in the economic, budgetary and social spheres of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we would like to point out that we believe that the report deals with a vitally important subject – access to health care is a basic prerequisite for development. Hundreds of thousands of children in sub-Saharan Africa die each year of diseases that are not fatal for anyone who has access to basic care. In our opinion, however, this report does not have the answer to the question of how this should be provided. It is a fact that civil society has played, and in many countries continues to play, a very major role as care provider. To categorically reject the work done by private care providers and non-governmental organisations is not the right way to go about things for someone who has the welfare of the poor in mind. At the same time, we would like to stress that we do, of course, support the wording in the report concerning women’s reproductive health and the condemnation of genital mutilation and the terrible acts of violence that women are still being subjected to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a real problem in implanting a model for organising social protection systems which is specific to Western civilisation in a totally different context. Many projects intended for developing countries have failed due to the adoption of an absolutist, Western-centrist approach, whether from Europe or the United States. This has led to resources being wasted and additional problems being created for the countries concerned. The specific situation of this area makes the observation even more obvious that we cannot treat health like a commodity. Consequently, forms of health care need to be identified which can be provided on a non-profit basis, inspired by the values of solidarity and democracy. The progress achieved over time, including through the contributions made by EU Member States, can be undone by adopting a hasty approach based on commercial considerations.

In order to achieve that, the European countries must keep their promise to allocate at least 0.7% of GNP to cooperation in 2010. The EU must support the numerous existing mutualist initiatives whose objective is to promote access to health care. The Member States are called on to provide their expertise and greater technical and financial support to the governments of developing countries in order to introduce and extend social security systems. Finally, the European Investment Bank also has a role to play in guaranteeing credit, cofinancing investments in clinics and taking on part of the remuneration of health professionals.

This will contribute to a fall in serious epidemics, such as HIV, tuberculosis and dysentery. It is not acceptable for private companies to hinder access to health care for the sake of profits, and it is even less acceptable for conservative religious movements to reject sexual and reproductive health policies and question the right to abortion, thereby putting the health of millions of women at risk. In order to improve the health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the world, it is essential for the European Union to be more in step with the rest of the international community.

Equally important is the fact that it highlights the problem of the shortage of qualified health professionals in many African countries. Instead of trying to help keep these resources in their countries of origin, several European countries have contributed to exacerbating the brain drain by enticing many such professionals away. Where the report could and should have gone further is in what it calls ‘external factors’, which ‘can radically reduce the margin for manoeuvre of states (…) and can have a profound effect on the health of their populations’. We certainly cannot ignore the structural adjustment programmes, the foreign debt, or the cuts and privatisations aimed at achieving viability, including in the health sector, where there are huge shortages already.

It is also well known that the majority of sub-Saharan Africans, especially those living in rural areas, cannot afford the cost of medicines. The report that we have voted on today in Parliament expresses a preference for sustainable health services financed either from public funds or from international solidarity. In fact, in this context, the European Union can play an important role by taking appropriate action to lay the foundations of a transparent funding system based on health indicators derived from the real needs of the population.

There are many factors, such as bad governance, natural disasters and extreme poverty, that contribute to creating a worrying situation; a situation in which health indicators in Africa are some of the most alarming in the world. As stated in the report, according to the World Bank, it is unlikely that developing countries will be able in the near future to finance their own national health systems from their tax revenue. In this context, non-profit-making systems with mixed financing from state resources, international support and public participation could help meet the immense challenge posed by health care in sub-Saharan Africa. Admittedly, some African countries have already embarked on some promising initiatives with the help of the international community. However, the European Union has a particular role to play in the implementation of solidarity-based health structures by providing guidance and funding basic health care systems, together with access to drugs.

Infant mortality is almost entirely concentrated in poor countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Even to this day, a woman dies every minute in the world from complications linked to pregnancy or childbirth. The main causes are haemorrhaging, infections and hypertensive crises. Statistics from the World Health Organisation show that the risk of dying as a result of pregnancy is 36 times higher for a woman in a developing country than it is for a woman living in a developed country. In the last few years, the number of fatalities has fallen by 34% but this statistic is less than one half of what would be required to meet Millennium Development Goal 5. Greater attention must be paid to helping those more at risk, namely, women living in rural areas and the poorest families, ethnic minorities and indigenous groups, and people living in conflict zones, and there must be more investment in health care systems so as to ensure that a better quality of care is finally made available to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report deals with a vitally important subject – it is obvious that access to health care is a basic prerequisite for development. Hundreds of thousands of children in sub-Saharan Africa die each year of diseases that are not fatal for anyone who has access to basic care. It is a disgrace to us in the developed world. Aid targeted at making health care accessible is needed. In my opinion, however, this report does not have acceptable answers to the question of how this should be done. It is a fact that civil society, particularly the faith-based organisations, has historically played, and in many countries south of the Sahara, continues to play, a very important role as a care provider. To do as this report does and categorically reject the work done by private care providers and non-governmental organisations is definitely not the right way to go about things for someone who genuinely has the welfare of the poor in mind.

I voted in favour of this resolution and it is vital that the EU continue to support sustainable growth in rural and remote areas. Ireland has received some EUR 10 billion since 1973 through the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Committee. I support what the resolution says about giving careful thought to the importance of regional development, and taking it into account in the EU budget, and about promoting a strong European regional policy with appropriate funding to achieve social, economic and territorial cohesion. Cohesion policy from 2013 onwards must meet the needs of the European regions, to help the EU community grow and flourish. It must be a simplified and transparent policy. There must be synergy with regional development policy and a coordinated approach, being managed at regional level, so that specific policy targets are reached and money distributed fairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cohesion policy is a particularly important part of EU policy, which aims to reduce disparities between the levels of development of European regions and to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion. An effectively implemented regional policy has great added value for the whole of the EU and its economic growth. The European Parliament has frequently expressed its position that cohesion policy is currently being developed against the backdrop of global challenges, which have a varying impact on the EU’s regions. It is therefore necessary to fundamentally improve the overall coordination of cohesion policy at EU level. In reality, the complexity and severity of the requirements and rules applied to cohesion policy are one of the main obstacles preventing the exploitation of these instruments’ potential. In order to ensure that cohesion policy objectives are achieved when the policy is implemented, there must be adequate flexibility so that it is adapted to the specific characteristics of individual regions so that they can overcome specific economic and social difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The motion for a resolution adopted today contains important aspects establishing a close link with the EU 2020 strategy objectives. The 2014-2021 budgetary framework must support an ambitious cohesion policy in terms of allocated resources. In addition, in view of the impact of the economic crisis on the less developed regions, the convergence objective must continue to be given predominant weighting in the future as well. In the case of Romania, implementation of this policy allows proper convergence to be established with the other EU states, especially as all eight development regions in my country can benefit from the Structural Funds. Attracting and making the best use of these funds would have resulted in a 15% rise in GDP over the next five years. However, as a result of the low administrative capacity of the administration departments within the ministries, the rate of absorption remains one of the lowest in Europe. Consequently, I believe that it would be useful to reorganise these existing administrative structures at ministry level and apply stringent skills criteria for selecting staff. Furthermore, I think that macro-regional strategies, like the Danube strategy, need to be maintained as priority aspects of this policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Parliament’s opinion that cohesion policy should be more results-oriented and that we should aim for even more effectiveness and usefulness because only then will this policy become more convenient and beneficial for consumers. To achieve this, we must fundamentally improve administrative procedures, increase financial control, coordinate national and regional procedures and make them more flexible and simple.

The resolution raises in a very timely manner the issue of the application of EU funds earmarked for regional development and of how to secure an environment in which these funds may be applied more flexibly, taking into account countries’ geographical location and the basic indicators of their economic efficiency. Unfortunately, in my country, Latvia, funds earmarked for the implementation of cohesion policy are applied in a very inefficient manner. The corruption endemic among officials in the Latvian Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Regional Development and Local Government practically ‘puts a brake on’ both initiatives by individuals and on any steps towards efficient application of EU financial resources. Due to the lack of an information campaign in Latvia regarding cohesion funds, its population is practically ignorant of the opportunities offered by the EU. I voted for this resolution, so that I could use it in explaining to certain Latvian ministers and civil servants that it is time to get to work in the EU and, naturally, for the benefit of Latvia. The opportunities to renew Latvia that have been passed up are a crime against future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective of cohesion policy is to reduce differences in the level of development of European regions and to increase growth potential to achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion. Cohesion policy, which is an expression of European solidarity, plays an extremely important role in the Europe 2020 programme. Its effective implementation is essential for further modernisation and to ensure lasting, stable economic growth and job creation in Europe. It is also intended to increase competitiveness and improve the quality of life of the EU’s citizens. I am definitely in favour of rejecting all attempts at renationalising cohesion policy or dividing it into sectors and embarking on a sectoral dispersion of the resources of this policy.

Its decentralised management is the most effective way of responding to the regions’ specific circumstances and requirements, and as such, it adds crucial value to national employment policies.

Nevertheless, it is essential for the managing authorities to take account of the actual situation in the regions and to establish policy areas for the ERDF that truly meet the needs of communities and local economic operators. It must be acknowledged that the management of the ERDF in our regions is characterised by serious disparities, and that is why I call for the standards in this area to be harmonised at European level. It is equally important to offer more scope to alter, in the medium term, the policy areas according to economic and social conditions and developments in the regions so that the ERDF can provide real added value throughout the programming period.

A sustainable economic growth and job creation policy in Europe is essential. The implementation of this policy should be supported by reforms in education, vocational education and training and retraining programmes, in order to adapt them to labour market needs, and it should receive the backing of small and medium sized enterprises. It is very important for the planned instruments to work together in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner so that the best results can be achieved. At EU level, the European Social Fund (ESF) plays a key role in improving employment and working conditions and in workers’ integration into the labour market. However, support from the structural funds alone is insufficient. In order to establish an effective and efficient system for financing social programmes, aid from the structural funds must be combined with other existing programmes, such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility, through which micro-credits are provided to small enterprises and support is given to people setting up a business, and other instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maximum financial support from the fund would help strengthen the feeling of solidarity among European citizens, especially those in the new Member States. During the 2007-2013 period, the European Union has allocated approximately EUR 3.5 million to Romania from the European Social Fund. The operational programmes are focusing on two areas. The first is aimed at developing human resources, while the second is intended to improve the public services and policies infrastructure through the ‘Development of administrative capabilities’ programme. In this context, the Structural Funds’ potential needs to be strengthened through simplifying and improving the relevant procedures. The main aim is to help Member States attain the best employment opportunities and the most active participation on the part of citizens in society. In future, the European Social Fund will need to play an important role in supporting the Europe 2020 strategy. This will definitely require action to be taken at both European and national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU 2020 strategy itself, together with its principal instrument, the Social Fund, will have to take account of the fact that the only employment and training policies that can make the outlay of European funds sustainable are those which are necessarily targeted at meeting local needs and strengthening and sustaining small and medium-sized enterprises as the cornerstone of the European economy. In future, we will have to pay much more attention than we have paid so far in the Social Fund and in the entire EU 2020 strategy to the local dimension and small businesses, which make up 99% of Europe’s economic fabric. In the expectation that the Union’s outlook on these vitally important issues will change, I am voting in favour of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to draw attention to the fact that it is very important for the Commission to distribute EU money allocated to the ESF in a targeted manner, because only then will this instrument directly help people to gain employment, find better jobs, overcome poverty, avoid social exclusion and lead life to the full. Furthermore, only a more effective and stronger ESF can lead to the implementation of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy in the fields of employment and social affairs and contribute to the reduction of unemployment and poverty in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I appreciate the fact that the resolution of the European Parliament recognises that structural funds remain, to a large extent, the chief instrument for financing aims in the area of social policy. At the same time, I support the request addressed to the Commission, emphasising the need for interdependence with other programmes, and support for cohesion with multi-year framework programmes such as Daphne, Progress, the Public Health Programme, and the ‘Europe for Citizens’ programme. No less important is the Commission’s call to boost the potential of structural funds by simplifying and improving approaches and flexibility, with an emphasis on the dimension of social integration, in order to help Member States optimise the results of social policy and employment policy and achieve sustainable growth. Finally, I supported this resolution of the European Parliament because it emphasises that the regional policy and social policy of the EU form a mutually interconnected whole, and for the success of the Europe 2020 strategy, it is necessary to provide a clear framework for achieving the cohesion of all European policies and structural funds, an end which the resolution challenges the Commission to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its action in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, education and vocational training is essential to the success of the EU 2020 strategy. The European Social Fund’s role could, however, be strengthened further. The future architecture of the Structural Funds for 2014-2020 will have to take into account the specific characteristics of that fund. Some adjustments could be envisaged. However, it is important to keep the European Social Fund within the framework of the general regulations on the Structural Funds, as is the case today. To grant it its own legal framework will inevitably have the effect of fragmenting European policies and creating pointless complications for the beneficiaries. European policy coherence must go hand in hand with an integrated vision of objectives and resources, which requires greater synergy between instruments. The European Social Fund should therefore continue to come under the regulation on general provisions concerning the funds, with its own rules, certainly, but under no circumstances with its own budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, today, as the economic crisis pushes the EU even further into recession and unemployment, into company and factory closures, poverty and social exclusion, despite 2010 being declared by the EU as the year for combating poverty, a question mark hangs over this objective. The priorities of all the European Funds, including the ESF, need to be revised for the benefit of the citizens and societies of Europe, not to serve the EU 2020 strategy, which follows on from the demonstrably failed Lisbon Strategy.

We have expressed ourselves in favour of the ESF becoming a more effective, simplified and transparent tool, which must continue to act as a powerful catalyst for the construction of social Europe. The ESF must be able to be deployed in the fight against poverty and social exclusion as a whole and must be able to fulfil the EU’s objectives in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain dishonest civil servants are enriching themselves from funds earmarked for training and reskilling. Newly established training centres and other unlicensed institutions are simply ‘laundering’ money earmarked for the training of the unemployed and other low-income groups, while the qualifications of trainers are often below the necessary standard. The fees charged by certain ‘training centres’ are higher than those of the University of Latvia. The European Social Fund has to pay for this negligent state of affairs. I supported this resolution. I was particularly struck by Paragraph 15, in which the European Parliament ‘calls on the Commission to strengthen the structural funds’ potential through simplification, flexibility and improvement of procedures ... with the aims of helping Member States to optimise the output of social and employment policies and creating sustainable growth’.

In this regard, beginning with qualification measures is much more forward-looking in the interests of job security and job placement for European workers. We need to make full use of the potential that we already have so that trade and industry cannot import huge numbers of cheap foreign specialists on the pretext of there being a lack of skilled workers. In this connection, the various ‘cards’ that are being considered should also be rejected. However, if the bringing to account and execution of projects leads to problems in many regions, and if the French PPP training programme, for example, has been waiting for payments for three years on account of a change in competences within the Brussels bureaucracy, the fund is failing in its mission. In any case, we need to make it clear that more attention needs to be focused on small and medium-sized enterprises as the ‘true’ employers.

As is well known, the European Social Fund plays a key role in supporting the Europe 2020 strategy, the principal objective of which is to achieve inclusive growth, a reduction in poverty, an increase in employment and a rise in training levels with the ultimate aim of creating new and better jobs. Seen in this light, the primary importance of the fund as a policy tool and its double value, in supporting employment policy and cohesion policy, on the one hand, and in real and harmonious regional development, on the other, can be understood. This last aspect – and I conclude – is of particular importance in that Europe cannot be said to be truly complete, cohesive and united if all the communities of which it is comprised are not truly developed and have not reached a level of growth that is both steady and uniform as far as possible. In particular, we must not forget the regions of southern Europe – the mobilisation of funds for the regions of eastern Europe, right and proper as it may be, must not be carried out at the expense of those regions that are the heart and soul of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that end, vocational training and retraining are of the greatest importance, especially during a period of economic crisis and growing unemployment such as the one we are witnessing today. The aim of the ESF is to improve workers’ employment opportunities and help to improve their living standards. It is therefore an essential instrument. Job creation and the promotion of employability are a means to achieving the objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the Union. Synergies between the various EU policies should be encouraged in order to achieve the Europe 2020 growth and employment targets. However, I am not in favour of making the ESF a financial instrument separate from the other structural funds, with its own rules and budget. I am of the opinion that it will be easier to achieve synergies if we do not embark on that kind of sectoring of European funds, but instead focus on improving coordination among the various instruments and making more efficient use of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
