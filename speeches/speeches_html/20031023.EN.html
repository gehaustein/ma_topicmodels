On Monday, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its new scientific recommendation for 2004 and has now, unfortunately, been obliged to confirm the disastrous state that cod stocks are in, including in the waters to the west of Scotland, in the eastern English Channel, in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat.</p>
<p class="contents">ICES has now advised that fishing for these four stocks be closed down. This, of course, puts us in a massive dilemma. Can we justify basing our decision solely on ICES’ argument in favour of replenishing stocks, which would result in our having to prohibit not only fishing for cod, but also for a whole range of other fish, and, in due course, in thousands of fishermen facing oblivion? Or could we find a way out by improving our plans for stock recovery, so that, although stocks would recover more slowly and would also involve some elements of uncertainty, fewer fishermen would be forced to abandon their trade? This is certainly a difficult decision, but it is one we will have to take before we can adopt any kind of plan to replenish cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The outline that we are debating today is a general one, and serves as a good basis for a cod stock recovery plan that would secure us the chance to revert to normal management conditions. It starts by identifying the lower limit below which scientists regard a stock as threatened with collapse. The plan contains formulae for calculating total allowable catches (TAC) on the basis of scientific estimates of current stocks. If the stock is larger than the lower limit, the TAC will be set in such a way that the stock can increase by 30% in the following year. It introduces limitations on the fishing effort, allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod. It also contains measures to improve the monitoring and control of the vessels whose fishing effort is subject to management measures; these include provisions on prior notification and on the requirement to land cod in designated ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the issue of cod stock recovery is an important one. It affects not only my own country of Scotland, but also the rest of the UK, Ireland and Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) warned us that young North Sea cod measured in early 2003 were at their lowest level in 20 years. Worries over repeating what happened in Newfoundland, where the cod never returned, haunt us all, and the ICES advice is stark: 'These cod stocks are at such a low level that we have had to resort to recommending zero catches as a final line in the sand'. Zero catches means no fishing in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal sets out a package of measures which, if followed, is believed to allow the safe recovery of this valuable stock within five to ten years. The Commission is not alone in this objective. Yesterday's cod recovery proposal from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation also stated that: 'restoring cod to its historic level of abundance remains an important objective for fishermen, since a revitalised cod fishery would transform the economics of the whole demersal fishery'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal attempts to achieve an absolute minimum size of stock, sets guidelines for setting total allowable catches (TACs), introduces fishing limitation through Kilowatt days and deals with the monitoring, inspection and control side of fisheries management</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have tried to say to the Commission that all action must be taken to recover stocks. We cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach across the areas covered by the plan. We need a flexible approach based on scientific assessment allowing fishing to continue for other species. Where it can be proved that fishing for other species in a particular area does not adversely affect cod recovery, fisheries should continue to be allowed and the concept of spatial management needs to be fully investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">On research, we need to look seriously at the interaction of cod and other commercial fish species such as haddock and whiting. This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of industrial fisheries also requires a thorough investigation. We constantly receive mixed messages on this issue and we need clarity. Regional advisory councils are vital to the future of a sustainable EU fishing policy. If we are going to be successful in our objectives of cod recovery, we must work with fishermen. I was happy to see this week's Commission proposal providing a blueprint for these regional advisory councils and how they would work, with two thirds of the membership of these new organisations coming from those active in the fisheries sector. I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the socio-economic impact of these measures, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough. Some of the communities most directly affected are in remote areas truly on the periphery of the European Union. Parliament has already recognised the importance of the socio-economic issues in its resolution of March 2003. To be fair, so too have some of the Member States. The Scottish Executive has given GBP 50 million, with GBP 40 million for decommissioning and GBP 10 million for the direct socio-economic impact. However, we have to be very clear that it is up to national and regional authorities to take up the possibilities available to them in assisting the sector during this difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see Member States carrying out socio-economic impact assessments on the recovery plan. On the basis of these reports, we would better be able to assess the problems and to mitigate any negative effects. I would like to see Member States having these in place one year after the implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On fishing effort limitation, the principle of proportionality must apply. The reference period used must take into consideration the pain the industry has already suffered through any decommissioning process. On inspection control, we need to extend satellite vessel monitoring, as suggested by the House of Lords report of May 2003. It seems a sensible measure and I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to come forward with a separate proposal on satellite monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the revised cod recovery plan will be painful for the fishing industry and dependent communities. There is no point inflicting a lesser degree of pain or indeed any suffering at all if the measures implemented do not bring about the desired result. Yet, if stock recovery is not achieved, the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship in any event. Successful recovery of the stock must be the priority. What is needed is a package of measures which is both effective and minimises the pain to the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It means that the Commission is complying with its commitments under the common fisheries policy. I also appreciate Mrs Stihler’s work and her report, together with the cooperation that she and I have enjoyed, in my case as draftsman<span class="bold"> </span>of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That committee’s amendment according to which the precautionary principle would lead to drastic measures being taken and to the Member States having the opportunity to take measures in addition to the common ones in order to protect and preserve stocks has been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, and that is something I am pleased about. As we heard earlier, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) will tomorrow present its annual report on the fish stocks in our oceans. Again, a total moratorium is recommended, which should make the doubters realise that measures really must be taken. We know that the Council, which can no longer put its head in the sand, must take action and adopt this plan. It is the fourth version that the Commission is presenting to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I am satisfied with the Commission’s proposal and believe that it is a move in the right direction, I should also like to have seen the Baltic Sea included, because we know that cod stocks are just as threatened there. The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission has, moreover, come up with further plans, which sounded quite good in October. I therefore withdrew my amendments concerning the Baltic Sea in the Committee on Fisheries. At a later meeting in October, the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission deviated from its own principles concerning what should be done. It is completely ignoring the scientific advice and states that the catch is 45% larger than what international advisers claim. That is very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Not taking the measures recommended by the international advisers is a waste of fisheries resources. The advisers consist of 1 600 researchers from 19 countries, and not listening to these researchers constitutes a waste of what could be flourishing fishing communities and a flourishing industry.

As we have heard once again, the ICES has stated that cod stocks are in such a dire state of collapse that it is recommending the complete closure of the cod fishery in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the West of Scotland. It claims that years of stringent conservation measures have failed to rebuild stocks and that only the total shutdown of these fishing grounds will enable any meaningful recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we know from bitter experience, that when the scientists once again call for the complete closure of the cod fishery, they also mean the virtual closure of the haddock, whiting, plaice and prawn fisheries, where cod is caught as a by-catch. Let me say this now to Commissioner Fischler and say it very clearly, because if there are any more cuts at the December Council meeting this year, it will spell the end of the UK white fish fleet. And I do not mean any more drastic cuts like last year, I mean any more cuts at all. The two previous massive decommissioning rounds have reduced the British white fish fleet by around 40%. The harbour workers and ancillary staff who rely on the white fish fleet for a living are now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Any further cuts will be fatal. It would mean that, even if cod stocks ever do recover, there will be no UK fishermen there to catch them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to attack the scientists. There is nothing to be gained from shooting the messenger, but this most recent ICES report once again highlights the vital importance of listening to the advice of the fishermen as well as to the boffins. Last year scientists told us that haddock stocks were dwindling. The fishermen said this was rubbish. Now the scientists agree that there are an estimated 400 000 tonnes of haddock spawning stock biomass in the North Sea. So who is right?</p>
<p class="contents">Could I in addition say that it appears the scientists are not listening to each other when arriving at their grand conclusions. According to new scientific research from the respected Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation in Plymouth, which has been monitoring the North Sea for the last 70 years, stocks of cold water plankton, on which cod larvae feed, have been driven hundreds of miles to the north by an unprecedented rise in water temperatures. This perhaps explains why there is a great abundance of cod being caught around the Faeroes, Iceland and Norway, but none left in the North Sea. So for heaven's sake, let us start listening to the fishermen as well as the scientists. The fishermen have a vested commercial interest in seeing cod stocks recover. That is the only way we are going to get a decent living for our fishermen in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, points out, for three years the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has been saying that the cod populations in the North Sea and off the west of Scotland are in serious danger of total collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that, on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions, we can implement recovery plans, which may or may not involve drastic measures which – we must not forget – always lead to the scrapping of ships, unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector, and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that the precautionary approach must be a residual criterion to be taken into account only when reliable and safe scientific opinions are not available, but under no circumstances must it replace these scientific opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing communities, as Mr Stevenson said a moment ago, demand a clear position, on the part of both the Commission and Parliament, in favour of prior, safe and well-founded scientific opinions, which take account of the sector’s opinions and which, as well as the state of resources, calculate and evaluate the socio-economic consequences of the conservation measures, and we have been asking the Commission for this for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Over-fishing is a determining factor, but it is not the only cause of the problem of scarcity of resources. Knowing the causes is essential if we want the recovery plans – this plan for cod and other future ones – to achieve their objectives, since if we restrict ourselves to reducing catches without tackling causes other than over-fishing – and I would mention the disruption of the food chain or sea pollution – we will perhaps find that the years will have passed and fish populations will not have increased.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ascertain the effects on the cod populations in the Irish Sea and the North Sea of the extraction of more than a million tonnes of fish of species other than cod, but which are, however, a source of food for cod. We also need to know the impact of industrial fishing on other populations of white fish, because that may perhaps provide the key to explaining the decline of cod and hake. We want the Commission to investigate the causes of this collapse of the species. We support the idea of a recovery plan which makes it possible to re-establish the stock and my group therefore supports the idea that the highest annual change, upwards or downwards, in any total allowable catch (TAC), should not exceed 15% after the first year of application of the recovery plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say that Mrs Stihler's very clear and comprehensive report improves on the Commission's proposal in three major respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it introduces greater flexibility by allowing amendments to the geographical areas covered and by providing for additional Kilowatt days in response to appropriate technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it calls for certain reports. These are variously on the effects of industrial fishing, on the socio-economic impact of the regulation and on how far the regulation itself is achieving its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it seeks the close involvement of regional advisory councils. The Commission's recent announcement of its proposal for establishing such bodies is welcome and we look forward to speedy progress in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures, together with the emphasis on constraints on fishing effort being proportionate between the Member States and on improved satellite monitoring, are essential if our beleaguered fishing communities are to engage with the regulation in any positive way. We must, however, look beyond the regulation to other means of helping cod recovery and of moving to sustainable fisheries overall.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish Fishermen's Federation's proposals for spatial management deserve serious consideration in this regard. Although the Scots are hardest hit, the impact is much wider, including the Irish, Danish and the Dutch, and we can learn from each other. One example is the self-monitoring currently practised by the latter. This again goes to show just how important a role regional advisory councils can play.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the House will support this report, which seeks to make the regulation far less of a blunt instrument than that fashioned by the original proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing. Like many other species, stocks are far below sustainable levels, and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse. The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem. If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems, instead of going at it in the opposite direction. There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high, and, basically scientific advice has not been followed. The Council has asked for a proposal for a recovery plan, which the Commission proposed in 2001, but the Council still does not seem to have the courage to adopt it. This is the fourth attempt.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has many good ideas including: outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted; rules for deciding about fishing, given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The ICES press release of Monday, which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned, shows that stocks are in grave danger. This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas, but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing. Last year, several TACs were set higher than ICES advised. The extreme example is the Irish Sea, with TACs set on average 28% above scientific advice over the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble? ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand, but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands, and this is the problem. Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board.</p>
<p class="contents">It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002. There have been some advances, such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation, in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not all good. The MAGPs, which we will come back to later today, have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction. This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement. The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things, and the Greens will, as usual, support the Commission. However, there is a crucial level for the survival of the stocks. But in the Irish Sea the Commission's proposal would allow fishing below a stock level of 6000 tonnes, whereas ICES is now advising closure until stocks reach that level. It is vital that the Commission reflects ICES advice when recommending TACs for the next year on these stocks. We can no longer ignore ICES. Mrs Stihler has mentioned the situation in Canada. That will happen here if we do not take a progressive position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP. In the conclusions of the Convention, fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy, instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this, by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty. This is something that will not unravel anything, nor will it upset balances in the final outcome. There is still time for this to be done. 'Where there is a will there is a way'.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report, which supports the main thrust of the Commission's plans, as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation. Like Mrs Stihler, however, I believe there must be greater flexibility. There must be far greater local participation in these decisions. Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Commission: questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal?

The question is how.</p>
<p class="contents">In its definitive recovery plan for cod, the Commission introduces an effort limitation system. This system has already been proving its worth in the Netherlands for a long time in the form of the ‘days at sea’ system, a system that enables effective control of fishing pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the plan also has the inevitable drawbacks. It only applies to vessels over ten metres in length, even though shorter vessels do play a part in cod fishing. The same goes for sport fishing. Industrial fishing, which regularly makes large by-catches of cod, is even left virtually untouched. The proportionality of the measures to be taken is unclear. The recovery plan should be less of a hindrance to the activities of fishermen whose by-catches of cod are small than to those of fishermen whose contribution to the problem is comparatively great. Incidentally, the impact of the various types of fishing can only be gauged accurately if the discards, too, are landed. There is no proposal to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The extremely drastic action that the Commission proposes for the long term – five to ten years – is based on a particularly alarmist diagnosis made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Two types of consideration cast a serious shadow, however, over the scientific rigour and objectivity of this analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the failure to take account of the realistic observations made by the professionals, who claim that there has been a geographical shift of cod towards the northern part of the North Sea. This migration is attributed to the significant and undisputed warming of the waters. Scientists have failed to study this phenomenon and instead concentrate solely on the size of fishermen’s catches. This is a widespread problem, which affects the entire common fisheries policy (CFP) and it is fortunate that the Committee on Fisheries has asked the Scientific and Technological Assessment (STOA), at my behest, to provide us with information on the effects of global warming on fish stocks. This inadequate credibility of scientific opinion is also a matter of concern to the Council, which has just decided to allocate more substantial appropriations to improving it. This failure to take account of the views of fishermen also highlights the lack of appropriate coordination between the two sources of information, the scientific and the professional. This is another major flaw in the CFP, and this is also acknowledged by the Commission, which wants the future transnational regional advisory councils to be the forum in which these two categories of data will be addressed jointly. When the quality of data is inadequate, we know full well what happens: the scientists take refuge behind the precautionary principle, by interpreting it in the broadest possible way, and the Commission tries do outdo it, each party protecting itself as comprehensively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second consideration that makes one wonder about the quality of the ICES’ evaluations is their systematic exoneration of any significant effects of industrial fisheries on cod stocks. It is strange to say the least, that the ICES talks about profit and losses for a type of fisheries that clearly has a significant effect, given the tonnage caught and the nature of targets, on cod stocks. Our rapporteur does address this point but far too cautiously. I suppose it is a start, though.</p>
<p class="contents">This was, incidentally, almost the only point on which the report diverges slightly from the Commission’s original proposals because it confines itself basically to supporting them as they stand, without subjecting them to any form of critical analysis and without proposing any changes. We are somewhat surprised that a parliamentary report should say so little about the genuine suffering felt by the communities that will be hard hit by this plan, communities that we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing professionals concerned are particularly concerned at the implementation of the new instrument provided for in the reform of the CFP, which is to reduce the fishing effort. This essential point should have been debated at length and questioned in this Chamber, because what we have here is an archetypal recovery plan, which will become increasingly widespread. The fact that it is replacing a bad, expensive and ineffective instrument does not make the fishing effort a good instrument. The Commission intends to implement this measure before it has convincingly demonstrated its relevance and feasibility. It is extremely worrying that calculating reductions in the fishing effort should lead in practice to writing off examples of exceeding quotas, illegal catches and ‘black fish’, to the detriment of those who have stuck to their quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">This process, Mr President, is not undermined in the slightest by the report, to which we cannot, consequently, give our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are glad about this and we are also happy with the report, on which we congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, despite the fact that originally she opposed our amendments to differentiate between the two species. Time has proved us to be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Recovery plans are very delicate and serious issues, which must be approached with recourse to the greatest possible scientific knowledge and with the greatest possible support from the sector involved as well, given their significant socio-economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the participation of scientists and fishermen, either directly or by means of the regional advisory councils, as proposed in the report, it is not possible to make a real, credible and transparent proposal, which is not only valid for cod, but for any other species or sector involved, as in the case of hake, whose sector we expect to hear soon in our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the consultation and we would also like to call on the European Commission to adapt the current Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural funds in the fisheries sector, so that the recovery plans are always accompanied by socio-economic measures cofinanced by the European Union in order to alleviate the negative consequences of the adoption of these recovery plans for the sector involved. This is the minimum we can ask for in order that the fishermen affected accept and comply with the plans laid down – whether they take place in Community or non-Community waters – whenever they affect European fleets, as in the recent case of the proposed recovery plan for halibut in NAFO waters. For all these cases, we must now provide for a general compensatory mechanism within the framework of the regulation I have mentioned, and we therefore call on Commissioner Fischler, for whose presence we are grateful, to make a proposal to Parliament in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can only say to you that while we sympathise with the victims of this disaster, we must also draw the right conclusions from it. We must ensure that our biological resources are no longer decimated on the say-so of an irrational common fisheries policy, and that this tragedy never happens again anywhere else in Europe. Actively aided and abetted by the Commission, the Council has recently opened up most of the Azores Exclusive Economic Zone, and is now threatening to allow predatory fishing methods, including bottom trawling, throughout much of that Exclusive Economic Zone. That goes against the democratic will of this Parliament, and against the opinion of the scientific community all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this measure, the Commission has taken a step which might lead to a repeat of the tragedy we have witnessed in the North Sea, this time in those sections of the Central Atlantic Ridge that have up to now been successfully protected from depredation. We urgently need a new fisheries policy, therefore, that enshrines in Community law the conventions of international maritime law, the right to property as defined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the precautionary principle, always preached and never practised. We need a fisheries policy that does more than reel off obituaries in the aftermath of measures that neither permit nor encourage sustainable fishing.</p>

We would not be facing so many crises if European management had been a success, would we?</p>
<p class="contents">Who has a vested interest in restoring stocks to sustainable levels? It is fishermen and fishing communities and only fishing communities. Why then is it continually the case that they feel that their views, their interests, and particularly their expertise, are ignored in management decision-making? Looking from Scotland it is impossible to justify or to accept the apparent inequitability of management decisions of late.</p>
<p class="contents">Scots are using the largest mesh sizes in all of the European Union and yet are taking the biggest catch cuts, while those using smaller meshes fare better. Once again, we have the threat of complete closure of haddock, whiting, prawn and other fisheries related to cod allegedly. Yet no mention of industrial fisheries which fish for non-human consumption being curtailed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am considering voting against the Stihler report, not because I am against its content which after all was substantially shaped by amendments of mine that were accepted in committee, but in protest at the likelihood that the Commission will ignore it anyway. It has after all repeatedly pointed out that there is no legal obligation upon it to consult regional advisory councils. In any case there will not be one in time for a cod recovery plan to be adopted. We all know that the Council 's output on this subject will probably ignore our views as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are very often accused, even by the Commission, of ignoring the science in their determination to defend their national interest in the Council. I just wish that Scotland had a Member State government which would defend its national interest in the fisheries council. Last December the then UK Fisheries Minister continued a long tradition of actively voting against Scotland's interests in the Council of Ministers and the new Minister, who finally managed to get himself to Scotland this week, where 70% of the UK fisheries fleet is based, told fishing communities to get real – presumably asking them to accept that there will be more pain to come because he knows that he will do nothing to help.</p>
<p class="contents">The social and economic pain being felt by families in Scotland's coastal communities is very real. They know the realities of recent decisions and their effects on them. It is totally unacceptable that the UK Government has absolutely no intention, yet again, of doing anything other than increasing that pain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There, too, I was frequently asked how best to deal with the serious danger to resources and the consequent threat of fishing being closed down.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I believe that we politicians cannot generalise when answering questions like that. If I say no, that an endangered resource is not to be barred to fishing, I may have to reckon with the resource not lasting for long, so that only a short time now remains in which it can be used, the inevitable consequence of which is that the socio-economic situation will deteriorate. If, on the contrary, I say yes, and that the resource should be barred to fishing, this may well promote the replenishment of the stocks, but even then many jobs will be lost in the fisheries sector and in the businesses that depend on it, never to be replaced, and it may be that regions will lose expertise that will never return there.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to effectively counter the threats posed to resources, especially of cod – which are indeed grave – whilst also taking into account all the consequences of our actions, I am now more than ever convinced that our primary need is for a comprehensive strategy for developing coastal regions, which means concerted action, the political will to protect resources, a checklist to be completed and processed, which shall be binding upon all. What I have called a strategy must involve all the stakeholders: biologists, researchers into marine ecosystems, and environmental campaigners just as much as politicians in the localities, in the capitals and in Brussels, and, last but not least, the fishermen and the fish processing industry. All of them have to shoulder their share of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as I have called for there to be what is termed a chain of responsibility in the area of maritime accidents, so I demand that there should be one in this area too. I urge that this strategic concept now be taken further with action of this kind. All the information we have indicates that it is five minutes to midnight!</p>

<p class="contents">Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on her very timely report. No doubt we will all have the usual shoot-out just before Christmas on TACs and quotas and we can see the lead into that coming along. For a long time – in fact for as long as I can remember – there has been a problem with cod stocks and we seem unable to find a solution to it because all our efforts to date have quite clearly not succeeded. We are told by the scientists that everything that has happened to date has not worked. We are told by the fishermen that the scientists have got it wrong. As I have said before in this House, we are stuck in the middle trying to find out what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">We have quite clearly not got it right to date, and I think we have to ask whether the scientists have got it right. Has what we have done to date achieved anything? I have to ask you, Commissioner, because in Box 7a in the Irish Sea, where the fishermen of Northern Ireland fish, those spawning grounds have been closed for the last four or five years to allow the new larvae to come forward. What, according to the scientists, has that achieved? Surely it should have achieved something or at least we should know if it has brought some response?</p>
<p class="contents">The recent ICES report will spell total disaster for the white fish industry in the United Kingdom as a whole and will certainly destroy the Northern Ireland fleet. I believe we need a more regional approach. I believe we need an input from the people at regional level and we need to look at other measures that will add to cod recovery. We have to look at what the effect will be on other species fishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise it is not easy and I realise you have a very difficult problem, Mr Fischler. Yet the common fisheries policy does not make it easier and you cannot resolve this problem unless you get the fishermen on your side, That is what you must try to do, because they are central to this, they are part of it and they are going to suffer most from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes the areas of TACs, managing effort through days at sea – based on stocks size consistent with the precautionary principle – and of course Chapter 4, which most importantly deals with measures to police, monitor, inspect and survey the effort management system. All stakeholders must be intimately involved in a bottom-up approach if stock recovery is to be achieved. Always presuming in the first place that the scientists have been looking for the stock in the right areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole area must be managed by the stakeholders through the regional advisory councils, if not, we will never bridge the deep divide that exists between fishermen and scientists at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed action plan, the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections. This must include the fishermen, national authorities and scientists, and the Figueiredo report later today will deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">As for last week's Fishery Council outcome on the Irish Box. Could you Commissioner, indicate clearly, on the record, how you will ensure there will be no increase in effort in the most sensitive southeast area of what was the Irish Box. This has now been excluded as a conservation area, with a serious reduction in the Irish Box which now is only to cover the southwest area.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate goal has to be sustainable fisheries through regional management, by opening up the governance of the common fisheries policy and helping to overcome mistrust and scepticism. We urgently need integrated regional management of the Irish Sea fishery. The status quo is no longer an option. I commend the establishment of the Pan-Irish Sea Alliance and wish them every success in delivering results to their vulnerable coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we do not need, as other colleagues have said, first- and second-class fishermen. But unfortunately, with the quota management system under the common fisheries policy, it is exactly what we have: first- and second-class fishermen. Some will have to stay with their boats tied up watching fishermen from other nationalities fish their very shores. That is the prospect facing fishermen in the south and east of Ireland at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also hope that her coming marathon, I think it is in New York, is just as successful as this report. The situation with cod fishing will then turn out well, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem in relation to cod stocks is well known; only our approach to the problem keeps changing. On the one hand, the ICES is now suggesting that we should stop all fishing, and, on the other, Canadian biologists maintain that there is no point, that it will not lead to the recovery of cod stocks. That means that the problem is intractable and can only be solved if genuine constructive cooperation is achieved between the Commission, the regions and the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, it is extremely important that the efforts and involvement of fishermen, in particular, play a part in this. It is almost impossible to tackle this kind of problem except by giving fishermen’s producer organisations a strong position: joint management of quotas, trying together to reduce by-catches as much as possible, and also looking together at how to counter the consequences of fishing effort limitations. In that regard, it would be good if the Commission were to make a generous commitment of Structural Funds for the regions hit hard by a reduction in cod fishing. Perhaps those funds can be used to attract new employment to those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my support once more for Mrs Stihler’s approach, and I hope that the Commission will take this report extremely seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now the plans have focussed on cod and hake resources in the north and, although there will soon be other proposals affecting other stocks, such as hake in the south, today we are talking about the re-establishment of cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that there are certain elements missing from the Commission’s proposal. Firstly, the lack of instruments to confront the socio-economic impact of the plans for the recovery of fishing grounds. I would like to stress the consequences of recovery plans for coastal regions or areas dependent of fishing. Therefore, within a reasonable time period – no more than a year, naturally – the European Commission should present a report, accompanied by proposals to alleviate the social and economic repercussions of the measures adopted, on the basis of the information communicated by the Member States. Commissioner, it is not a question of failing to defend the recovery of stocks, but of defending the fishermen and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the ICES published its latest opinion on the situation of stocks of various species and there is little optimism to be had from it. While the Commission should monitor the various scientific opinions, it is not sufficient to automatically accept this type of proposal with serious repercussions of many kinds – social, most importantly: we must call for the presentation of compensatory measures to prevent traumatic situations in the regions dependent on fisheries, for fishermen and for their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe, and I will end here, Mr President, that the involvement of the sector must be the third essential requirement for the success of the proposals on the recovery of stocks.</p>

There will be other opportunities to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to the questions raised by setting out the Commission’s position on the individual amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to accept Amendment No 1 on the grounds that drastic measures are called for, not by the precautionary approach, but by the fact that cod stocks are below biologically safe levels and are therefore threatened by collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, though, very much able to accept Amendment No 2, although I would suggest a clearer form of words indicating that the fishing effort should be constrained in proportion to the Member States’ catches.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 came as a surprise to me, since, as you are aware, I have called on the Member States, not once but repeatedly, to inform us of the socio-economic impact of the recovery plan. I also asked them to notify us of any additional financial requirements they might have. The Commission has, unfortunately, received no replies to these enquiries. I have also drawn the attention of the Member States to the fact that they can reprogram the funds in the FIFG in order to support the sector. None of them have availed themselves of this facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 is superfluous, as the Commission can, in any case, propose changes to the geographical areas in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Amendment No 6, I have to tell you that these technical measures can, if need be, supplement restrictions on fishing effort, but cannot replace them.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 is superfluous, as, if fishing vessels are not on either List 1 or List 2, then they are not permitted to land catches of the species mentioned. The fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the list in Article 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 8 will not work, as the definition of ‘days absent from port’ must correspond with that laid down in other regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that Amendment No 9 is to the point, as satellite monitoring systems will be required to be installed on all vessels over 15 metres in length with effect from 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have to reject Amendment No 11, I would at the same time like to point out that ICES is engaged in completing its ecosystem study on the influence of industrial fishing, and we will take appropriate account of any new knowledge that emerges from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept the first two paragraphs of Amendment No 12, but am obliged to reject the third. We cannot instruct the Member States to access any funds to cushion the socio-economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13 is, I think, a very good one, as there is a need for the annual review of stocks that it proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obliged to reject Amendment No 14. No new definition of the tasks of the regional advisory councils is required as they are clearly laid down in the new Framework Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my understanding that you are willing to send a letter to the Council including that table. It will not, therefore, be necessary to include the table as an integral part of the resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">Amendment No 649 on budget line 070308 is to be modified as follows. The following remarks should are deleted: "Part of the appropriation may be allocated to the European Academy of the Urban Environment in Berlin, with due regard for the provisions of the Financial Regulation".</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 754 on budget line 15060103 is modified as follows. The following remarks are added. "EUR 150 000 is earmarked for a grant to the European Academy of the Urban Environment in Berlin" and the figures are increased by the same amount and therefore by EUR 150 000.</p>

We have voted against this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years, our House has been itching to fund so-called ‘European’ political parties out of the public purse. This has been impossible, however, due to the lack of a legal base. The Treaty of Nice made a timely appearance on the scene and provided one (Article 191(4) TEC), but an implementing regulation is still required.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not easy to draft, however, because it seeks to discriminate, in a very clumsy way, between the supposedly ‘integrationist’ political parties and the others, but also between the strictly European political parties and those that, from a national base, work at European level. It thereby runs counter to Article 191(4) of the Treaty, even as amended by Nice, which gives a broad definition of those who can benefit from funding, where it refers to parties ‘at European level’ – unlike what the current wording of item 3710 would have us believe.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to overcome this new hurdle, the draft European Constitution makes yet another change: it subtly targets political parties ‘at’ European level (Article I(45)(4). Unfortunately for the federalists, however, this text is still a long way from being adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foreign policy must remain under the sovereignty of nations. In the field of Union aid for the reconstruction of Iraq, the Council of Ministers, like the European Commission, has agreed to acknowledge that a sum of around EUR 200 million until the end of 2004 would provide the necessary and sufficient contribution to the reconstruction of the country, leaving food aid and emergency aid aside, in the knowledge incidentally, that Iraq’s absorption capacity, according to these institutions, is limited. Furthermore, in order to match the needs of the Iraqi people, the European Union’s contribution must be set against the background of a specific political agreement on the conditions for its implementation, with a key role being given to the United Nations.</p>

Scant attention has been paid to the victims, who are subject to different national compensation systems which experience great difficulty in terms of coordination and enforcement in the specific case of cross-border crimes. It is important, then, to draw up minimum standards defining the terms ‘victim’ and ‘crime’, establishing which persons are eligible to benefit from compensation if the victim dies, and determining the methods and means of payment.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, the rapporteur’s belief in the central importance of guaranteeing compensation is particularly impressive.

We were aware of the cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Strasbourg, but we are now seeing a particularly nasty outbreak of liberalism. I am referring to the Jarzembowski report and I am astonished that the vote went in favour of the rapid liberalisation not only of freight but also of passenger transport, despite the warnings of the Commission and the Council and despite the fact that most rail companies are not ready for such changes. We would be acting without having seen the evaluation asked for by the Commission and in the knowledge that this action will have significant consequences in terms of safety, social conditions and the quality of service provided to the citizens. I believe that Parliament has today voted quite irresponsibly and that it has been dictated to by national self-interest and by forthcoming elections.

<p class="contents">It is my belief that the unification of our continent, which is currently underway, makes the rail link running from Paris via Strasbourg and southern Germany to Vienna and Budapest, as well as the route from Stuttgart to Prague, of pre-eminent importance. Our discussions of railway policy give me the feeling that it is far from clear to many of those responsible that far more is at stake than whether or not this or that area is opened up to traffic; this is really about a great transport project called ‘European Unity’. What we have achieved to date is fragmentary at best, and I wish to appeal, above all to the Council, the governments and the Member States to make substantial funds available for railway policy. I believe that this is not only of paramount economic importance, but also that the unification of Europe as a whole cannot succeed unless we at last do massive extension work on the routes between east and west. Although these connect the most important regions of Central Europe with one another, it is unfortunate that they do not link up to most of the national capitals. It is for this reason that many states that focus on their own capital – Germany, for example – regard them as far too peripheral. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the effects of directive 2001/12 on access rights to the Trans-European rail freight network could not be evaluated, because it is still being transposed in the Member States, the European Commission and Mr Jarzembowski propose to speed up the complete liberalisation of rail transport. It is simplistic to claim that the fall in rail’s competitiveness is due to its failure to open up. Passenger rail transport did not need to be opened up for competitive and safe rail lines to be built. Cooperation between operators works – at least where the Thalys is concerned. What Europe lacks is an industrial policy, closer cooperation between public service operators and the development of Member States’ and the Union’s budgets for investment in the trans-European networks. Despite the improvements that have been made to it, Mr Sterckx’s report confirms what the Council of Ministers has already accepted: subordinating safety to profit. I support the Savary report on creating a European Railway Agency, whose administrative board would include representatives from employees’ organisations and which would take account of the environmental, social and safety aspects in line with the proposals tabled by Mrs Ainardi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the examples of the telecommunications, post, electricity and natural gas sectors, it is meant to help open up the networks to competition and thus reduce prices for consumers. This line of thought is fundamentally sound and should be implemented, but not in the one fell swoop that some of my fellow-MEPs envisage.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all railway companies are the same; that there are small ones and large ones is not attributable solely to some being more efficient than others, but also to some companies having had from the very outset a monopoly in a larger market than others. If the markets were opened up too quickly, the result would be unjustified and unfair distortion of competition to the advantage of the former monopolies in the larger Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I advocate the opening up of the railway networks, this must be done in accordance with a timetable that makes it possible for all the parties concerned, whether enterprises or workers, to prepare themselves for the new state of affairs. Imposing an earlier deadline for opening up the railway networks for national goods traffic – 2006 rather than 2008 – is not acceptable, any more than is the introduction of a deadline for national passenger traffic, for which 2008 has been suggested.</p>

Establishing this agency is justified still more convincingly by the growing liberalisation of the sector and the coming propagation of uniform safety rules throughout all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If disseminated properly, moreover, the agency’s activities in the fields of consultancy, proposals and observation may lead to a greater awareness of the enormous benefits of rail transport among both the Member States and the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Committee on Transport’s view that actors in the road transport sector should be involved in the work of the agency. I disagree with this committee, however, over the composition of the agency. The committee opposes the inclusion, on the agency’s Administrative Board, of Council representatives drawn from the whole range of the Member States. Such representation is likely to be important, and should, at least, involve all countries that have large rail networks and/or are part of the trans-European networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The donation of organs by living persons is a genuine source of abuse and often represents the exploitation of poverty. The use of living donors must only ever be considered as a last resort, when transplants from dead people are impossible. I therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that any removal of organs from persons that are not closely related, as defined by the law, should be punished. When there is no such relationship, these donations could take place only under conditions laid down by the law and once an appropriate independent body has given its authorisation. Organ donation by living donors must be extremely closely supervised and monitored in order to protect the vulnerable and to prevent the exploitation of human beings in order to obtain their organs, which is an unacceptable practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that this was not done obliged a number of Members, including Mrs Pack and myself, to vote against this report on the grounds that its infelicitous drafting gave the impression that the Western Balkans, Belarus, the Ukraine and Moldavia were among the neighbouring regions of Europe rather than of the European Union. There is no doubt, though, that these states form part of Europe, and, self-evidently, the Western Balkans also have the prospect of accession – indeed, ever since Thessaloniki, the right of accession, too – as soon as these states fulfil the European Union’s criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore object to the way in which this form of words puts the Western Balkans on the same level as West Africa and the Southern Caucasus. That is quite nonsensical. I do assume, however, that the expression ‘Western Balkans’ does not mean Croatia, as this House, on the basis of an amendment that I jointly got introduced into another report by Mr Brok, decided as long ago as 9 April this year that it regards Croatia as a candidate for accession in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- the report talks of militarising the EU in the interests of so-called ‘transatlantic relations’, seeking a ‘partnership’ between the EU and the USA so as to dominate and divide up the world;</p>

This need is highlighted by the success of this week's common mission to Iran, and is underlined by the desperate need for Europe to maintain pressure through the quartet dealing with the Middle East Peace Process. However, we must caution against further changes to the proposed EU constitution; changes which in our view will not realistically help to achieve our aims. European Governments will not accept the community method or qualified majority voting for CFSP, nor a Foreign Minister based wholly within the Commission. Introducing an EU defence solidarity clause or establishing separate planning and management headquarters risks unnecessary duplication with NATO. Governments of militarily neutral EU countries will reject such demands, above and beyond others. We strongly support a defence agency, but its focus should be on building military capability across the Member States, not on the procurement of equipment for a separate EU defence force, which has not even been proposed. The issue overall is one of political will, not simply institutional arrangements, and that's where this Parliament – and this report – can make its biggest impact.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, it states, however, that this policy of the European Union ‘will depend ultimately on … its military capabilities, and on a readiness … to deploy them’. In addition, it considers a strengthening of the relations between the EU and NATO to be ‘an important feature leading to the development of a European approach to security’. Finally, it ‘[w]elcomes the measures taken by the EU in the international fight against terrorism’. The proposed multilateralism remains, therefore, a facade. The old imperialist vision of a civilising mission on the part of Europe, shared with the United States and including military options, has just been readjusted.</p>
<p class="contents">Our own vision is the opposite. War must definitely be rejected as a means of resolving conflicts. Priority must be given to the social, rather than military, budgets. Moreover, we refuse to accept that, in the name of a highly selective fight against terrorism, which leaves state terrorism to one side, every freedom should be attacked. It is therefore up to our peoples to impose a different collective security policy in which the exploited of both north and south stand shoulder to shoulder in combating war and poverty.

In his report, he takes the opportunity to himself express what the Council omits to say. When talking about influence over neighbouring regions, he makes no distinction between possible future EU Member States in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union on the one hand, and desired spheres of influence in West Africa and the Middle East on the other. The EU’s capacity for action would be benefited by the abolition of the principle of unanimity of the Member States and by increased power for the future European Foreign Minister. A powerful, united European superstate is a major contributor to the United Nations, which must be radically reformed, partly for the sake of European interests. From 2004, a European intervention force should have a 5000-man force permanently available for rescue and humanitarian operations, which, by 2009, should be ready to fight in wars elsewhere in Europe according to the Kosovo model. A united front with the USA is desirable. I thank Mr Brok for his clarity. Since his model differs substantially from my beliefs, I shall be voting against this report, although I do agree with him on one point.

Instead of disputing each other’s right to exist and forcing neighbouring peoples to emigrate, they would live peacefully side by side from then on, without humiliation, obstacles or fear. Then, however, the extremes on both sides saw another chance to sow the seeds of hatred. Fear of the other’s violence is leading people to choose the path of violence. The majority of the inhabitants of Israel does accept a Palestinian State, but, back home, gives the power of government to an opponent of that State, because it sees in him its best chance of protection against Palestinian violence. In Palestine, groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad have grown powerful because people think that, in any case, agreement can never be reached with the occupying power, which is seizing ever more land for settlements and the construction of a wall. It seems that relations between Israel and Palestine will be forever hopeless as a result. On 12 November, the moderate powers from both countries are due to come together in Geneva to present a negotiated final solution for a just peace. Fortunately, this report moves in that very direction, but it is important that a comfortable majority in the European Parliament emphatically supports the peace plan today by adopting Amendment No 11. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the constructive dialogue motivated by this common goal has given way to a sectarianism more commonly found elsewhere. The result has been a string of monologues, one after another, that contribute little to solving this problem effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remain strictly impartial and objective on this issue, resisting the temptation to approach it bombastically.</p>
<p class="contents">It gives me cause for deep regret that this issue should still be a hostage to factionalism and radical pamphleteering which, on top of everything else, damages the credibility of the European Parliament and leads to its resolutions being held in contempt.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparing the actions of a democratic sovereign state in defence of its citizens to terrorism constitutes an inexcusable inversion of the principles which should guide an independent evaluation of the causes and effects of this conflict, in the certainty that peace for both nations will have to be attained not by seeking to apportion blame but via the road of justice, stability and honour.</p>

Thus, an effort is being made, among other things, to shift the responsibility for growth from the social to the personal level. Unemployment, for example, is being interpreted as a lack of entrepreneurship on the part of the unemployed rather than as a constituent element of capitalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Commission text and the report by parliamentary Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are hymns to this new ideal. The Commission proposes three pillars for action: bringing down the barriers to business development, balancing risks and rewards and promoting a society that values entrepreneurship. In other words, it is proposing full unaccountability for companies, cheap money and guarantees that investments will bring in excessive profits and a propaganda campaign at all levels (education, mass media and so on) in order to persuade even the inexperienced that they must worship entrepreneurship or, at the very least, entrepreneurs. The report follows in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are not surprised that the capitalist EU deifies entrepreneurship. However, our ideals and our principles do not allow us to accept such an approach. We distinguish between personal action and collective action and between the profit-making capitalist enterprise and one that operates for the benefit of society as a whole. That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the reports.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The documents with which we are here concerned take us, however, into a virtual world or ideological construction glorifying the market. In this way, the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship and this report, which comments upon it, presuppose that ‘entrepreneurs are the driving force of the social market economy’. Wage earners, obviously viewed as the force of inertia, will be most appreciative. Moreover, the Green Paper conceals nothing of the Commission’s ill opinion of the ‘bottlenecks affecting the flexibility of [the] labour market’. The Langen report also asks for initiatives to be taken to ‘put an end to old-fashioned attitudes which insist on attributing guilt to entrepreneurial activity and demonising business profit’. Yet, in ‘real life’, it is in fact large companies’ attempts to maximise their profits that crush small subcontractors. Such companies require the lowest prices and the highest rates of work from them, with repercussions for salaries and the conditions of work of wage earners now without secure employment. The documents proposed have nothing to say about this, but repeat the tired refrain about the need to reduce social charges. We have therefore voted against this biased report of limited scope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the European Union can truly become ‘the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world’ only if economic actors within it, and SMEs in particular, become dynamic themselves, take an interest and participate. To that end, it is important to remove the obstacles lurking in every sector of enterprise policy, create a genuinely favourable environment in areas such as taxation, the workplace and ethics, and mount an energetic, swift and effective attack on problems of a structural nature, such as the aversion to risk and pessimism about setting up in business of young people in some Member States. I agree entirely with the rapporteur that simply devising new promotional campaigns is not enough to solve this kind of problem. What is needed here is a return to a belief in the forces of the social market economy in order to create incentives for potential entrepreneurs to assume entrepreneurial risk and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Entrepreneurship, which, it is hoped, will be a source of jobs, growth, competitiveness, the realisation of individual potential and the development of society as a whole, will stem above all from the ‘favourable environment’ which Community and national institutions are able to create through their actions.

In the wake of the communication by the European Commission, it has put on today’s agenda and, once again, on the European agenda, the decisive question of future industrial policy in Europe, particularly in the context of the current enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes are currently being rung on the Union’s industrial policy, which is confronted at present with the consequences of the introduction of the euro and of enlargement. A new approach must indeed be found to industrial policy, hinging on the following priorities: sustaining efforts in the field of education, training and skills, reducing tax obstacles, increasing investment in research and innovation, assuring the quality of infrastructure (transport, communications and energy), facilitating the financing of businesses and social dialogue, making the procedures for starting up businesses more flexible, and so on. It will only be possible to achieve the objectives laid down in the Lisbon strategy and move towards harmonisation in an enlarged Europe, based on current Union labour standards, if these different considerations are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is indeed crucial to enhance, encourage and assist the entrepreneurial side of industry, always seeking economic effectiveness at the same time as social and human effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has drawn up a balanced report, and I therefore voted in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a regime should yield results which are properly comparable, whatever the operator’s nationality and whichever national inspection service is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a general consensus in the European Parliament and the fisheries sector on the need to improve coordination of inspection and surveillance activities at Community level, rationalising resources and setting priorities, especially in areas where greater cooperation between Member States is necessary, namely in international areas governed by regional organisations to which the EU is a contracting party.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressing ahead with those measures aimed at harmonising processes and objectives is also seen as desirable, based on the experience acquired over the years by the various Member States, notably in crossborder cooperation, always bearing in mind the role of national authorities in the monitoring and evaluation of inspection and surveillance activities in dialogue with the sector and the national authorities, while not losing sight of objective regional differences or undermining the specific role of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As we emphasise several times in the report, effective implementation of the common fisheries policy depends, first and foremost, on fishermen’s acceptance of and compliance with the rules governing fisheries, which will increase if fishermen’s organisations are enabled to participate in the decision-making process at all levels. We believe this to be a particularly important point.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as important, however, to take measures to achieve a more effective use of national inspection and surveillance resources in selected fisheries or population units. These measures need to be examined and debated by all the interested parties, including fishermen’s organisations, producers, vessel owners and national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We would draw attention, however, to the high costs of using new technology, which is important in this area and in improving inspection and vigilance measures. As such use of new technology may require very substantial investment, however, sufficient funding must be provided in the Community budget, and support must be given to Member States needing it.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Commission’s intention of tabling a proposal to create a Joint Inspection Structure, based principally on a Community Fisheries Control Agency, with a view to ensuring coordination of national inspection and surveillance resources, we insist that the Commission must, in coordination with the Member States, undertake a feasibility study, on as broad a basis as possible, with regard to establishing an organisational structure for Community inspection and surveillance. This study should, above all, include a comparative cost-benefit analysis and consideration of better use of national means and the practical implications in terms of material, financial and human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to explore models for cooperation at Community level in the field of monitoring and implementation that could offer an alternative to the proposal to create the aforementioned joint agency or structure, and which might well cost less. We insist on the need for such a study, therefore, before any subsequent decisions are taken. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by thanking all those who worked together to produce this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Member States and the Commission must now make every effort to ensure that the rules in force are correctly applied. In order to achieve this common objective, I believe that we are all in complete agreement that we need to step up cooperation in the area of monitoring. From this point of view, the Commission communication defines a strategy for cooperation and coordination between the Member States and at EU level, focusing on both short-term and medium-term goals. What we have drawn up is an action plan that seeks to establish a coherent strategy to ensure that the inspection and monitoring activities of the Member States – which are first and foremost their responsibility – are more effective, and to this end we propose three major areas of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the definition of inspection priorities for the most threatened stocks. This approach will then have to be extended to other activities, such as those involving the fishing of highly migratory species in the Mediterranean or the landing of vessels engaged in illegal fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area of action is the adoption of specific and transparent monitoring programmes that are tailored to the characteristics of the fisheries activities in question. We recommend that all the national authorities concerned should help to draw up programmes to cover inspection and monitoring at sea and, of course, the control of landings and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area is the improvement of cooperation to ensure that the monitoring and application of the rules are uniform and more effective. Experience shows that selective or voluntary cooperation is insufficient, particularly as regards access to information, operational cooperation and follow-up of irregularities and infringements. We agree with the industry that the inspection procedures should be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary cooperation is therefore no longer enough, and in our view an organisational structure at Community level is now necessary. That is the reason for this feasibility study in which we hope to involve the Member States and interested parties – beginning, of course, with fishermen and their various communities, as mentioned by Mrs Figueiredo – the aim being to establish a joint inspection structure through a Community Fisheries Control Agency. This feasibility study will have in mind an agency responsible for the organisation and deployment of all of the means of inspection and monitoring according to the priorities to be established at Community level. In conclusion, the dialogue on this communication does not pose any problems and we thank Mrs Figueiredo again for her comments and her support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The uniform application of the CFP in all the Member States is an important challenge, undoubtedly, and we must therefore also congratulate the European Commission on its proposal. There can be no sound fisheries policy without real and effective control in which the fisheries sector itself also participates.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies allow for better and greater control, and they must be used to improve compliance with the common fisheries policy. This control must not relate exclusively to fishing itself, but it must also, and this is very important, be extended to the other phases of the process, in other words, to the chain of marketing, transport, sales and so forth, also including controls in catering establishments. We therefore all agree that more homogeneity, more rationality, more resources and more budget are required.</p>
<p class="contents">I will dedicate the rest of the time available to me to a few brief comments on the report by Mrs McKenna since, although our group had requested a joint debate on these reports, this has not been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur and I am pleased that, both in the annual report by the Commission and in the report by Parliament, it is stressed that just four Member States have complied 100% with the requirements for the corresponding boxes in all segments of the fleet. These States are: Finland, Denmark, Spain and Portugal. In other words, there are 11 States which are not complying with them, and that is the most important thing in my view, together with the clear fact – and allow me to point this out as a Spanish person – that Spain is one of them. In this way I hope to counter, and I would like to make this clear, certain attempts to slander and discredit the Spanish fisheries sector. Spain, however, is one of only four States, I repeat, which comply with the fleet-reduction plans, and I believe it is necessary to stress this here, in the presence of other States and therefore of other representatives of other Member States which are non-compliant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective pursued – the coherent application of the common fisheries policy – should be extended to all Community policies and, furthermore, to European Union policies and Member States’ policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for coherence, not contradiction, between the various Community policies and also between the various aspects of the CFP. We must direct all actions of the common fisheries policy towards a common objective, that of sustainable fishing, which is the only way to make fishing a lasting activity. But the Union’s other policies, such as industrial policy or environmental policy, must also contribute to the preservation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community institutions have become, as a result of the principle of subsidiarity, a form of legislative machinery which depends for its execution on the Member States, which means that this uniform and effective implementation depends on the goodwill of those States. By the same token, infringements and compliance or non-compliance also depend on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Violations of Community legislation are increasing, and this is undermining it and making it less and less effective. At the same time, calls for the renationalisation or regionalisation of Community policies such as the CFP are also increasing. Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that the draft European Constitution lays down four exclusive competences for the Union and that one of them is precisely the management of fisheries sources.</p>
<p class="contents">The parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore pleased that the Commission is proposing the creation of a common inspection structure. We have called for this common structure in numerous resolutions, such as the one adopted in relation to the Green Paper on the reform of the CFP. The Commission, therefore, has the support of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain, the Count of Romanones, who was a minister during the era of the Restoration, at the beginning of the twentieth century, said: ‘laws are for Parliament, but leave the regulations to me’. Well, the objective of sustainable fishing will not be achieved on the basis of laws or on the basis of regulations, which are necessary but insufficient. It is essential to involve, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other, all the agents who participate in the sector, in the broadest sense, including marketing, so that we can achieve this objective. Moreover, action cannot be restricted to the Community framework – as we see in every meeting of the Committee on Fisheries – since the causes of many of the problems facing our fishing arise at international level, and it is at that level that solutions can be found. Cooperation between the various administrations is therefore essential if we want the CFP to be successful. Furthermore, the regional and local administrations, which often, as in the case of marketing, are responsible for applying Community rules, must also feel that they are participating in decision-making. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important that we have uniform rules and uniform monitoring procedures. That is very important if we are to have fair competition in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is important that the monitoring be organised at international level as far as possible, so that north, south, east and west all have the same feeling about the completion of the monitoring. I should like to emphasise that there are a great many plans, that we all want structural change, but I should like to add that the financing of this must be temporary. We must not give a permanent allowance for the implementation of these structural changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say another thing about the practical implementation in the future. I think that changes are necessary, and they can only be achieved if the fishermen’s organisations are willing to cooperate. There are sufficient individual examples of this in the European Union, but there is too little structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make another plea for something that the North Sea Commission Fisheries Partnership has already introduced, namely letting biologists sail on fishing vessels. This means that they no longer miss the boat, since they are following in their own little boat. We must ensure that ecology and economy want to share the same future; changes can also be made much more effectively if that desire is there. I should like to draw attention to this system, therefore, and also make a renewed call for new, improved methods: that is to say, research into acoustic methods for distinguishing species of fish, and a review of the situation regarding by-catches – as it is incredibly important that we form a picture of not only the main catch, but also the by-catch. It is important, therefore, that we are also able to record that picture by landing the catch and, at landing, recording everything that comes out. This is how to make a real contribution to the future of the fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, by way of conclusion, I should like to make one more small remark: it would also be useful if the rights were transferable in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and courage of her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secret and illegal activities, poaching and clandestine trade jeopardise the entire activity of professional fishermen. This activity will only be politically and socially objective and economically profitable if the controls are effective, fair, clear, transparent and identical in all of the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today they are notoriously inadequate. To strengthen them, they must be streamlined and modernised. We need to develop controls on satellite positioning and improve logbooks, and each state must establish substantial and adequate human and material resources. States are responsible for controls, as you pointed out; they must continue to be responsible for them, but they must improve and strengthen them. The European Union must coordinate them and the Commission’s specialised fisheries departments must assess the impact of this improvement. If the impact of these controls continues to be insufficient, and only if this is the case, perhaps we will have to consider the possibility of a joint inspection structure, which would be supported in particular by a Community Fisheries Control Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our common fisheries policy is only as strong as its weakest link. This means that monitoring is particularly important, because it is only by means of effective quota management that we shall be able to conduct a successful common fisheries policy in the future, too. For that reason, I have tabled a number of amendments, also on behalf of my group, which the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur have taken over; for this I thank them.</p>
<p class="contents">Differences in the Member States’ monitoring methods must be eliminated. For that reason, we strongly advocate a Community office to monitor the enforcement of the CFP. That policy would also benefit from being firmly rooted in society and from confidence on the part of the sector itself. Consequently, we have campaigned for the possibility of setting up transnational producer organisations. Enabling cross-border coordination gives a system of sustainable fishing a broader basis. The efforts of fishermen are indispensable in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On that point, I should also like to call once more for particular attention to the shrimp sector. For years, this sector had a system of sustainable fishing, which earned the praise of many. However, a national competition authority<span class="bold"> </span>in the Netherlands intervened, and this was brought to an abrupt end. On behalf of my group, I should like to make an emphatic plea, including to the Commission, that Commissioner Fischler make a commitment to permitting these producer organisations. This is incorporated into an amendment which I have tabled, and the Committee on Fisheries has approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Too much and too often, the efforts of other Commissioners seem to frustrate Commissioner Fischler in that regard. I am referring in particular to Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein, whose portfolios include competition policy. An excessively liberal approach on the part of one section of the Commission must not frustrate the social position of fishermen and the environmental situation in the North Sea. In that sense, too, I am very happy with this report. The Commission would do well to realise that the efforts of fisheries’ producer organisations, in particular – including across borders – will be indispensable to a genuinely rigorous approach to the fisheries issue in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proper control and monitoring of the common fisheries policy and the even-handed implementation of the rules is, of course, the only way to return a semblance of credit to this much discredited common policy. However, I have to say that any new control system will require the cooperation of the sector, of the fishermen themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishermen are rapidly losing any respect they ever may have had for this discredited policy. For example, take what happened last week. The same week as the ICES published its most recent report, calling for the complete closure of the cod fishery around Britain and Ireland, the Council of Ministers tore open the Irish Box and tore open the economic exclusion zone around the Azores and Madeira, allowing a virtual free-for-all in some of the most sensitive spawning and nursery grounds in European waters.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a decision based on political pressure; it owed nothing to conservation and everything to politics. It is decisions like this that have brought the whole CFP into disrepute. How can our fishermen believe that their endless hardship is in the name of conservation, when they see decisions like this being taken which fly in the face of common sense?</p>
<p class="contents">It is also time that the Commission tackled the disgrace of the two million tonnes of good healthy fish that are discarded dead back into the sea every year in the name of conservation. The public will no longer tolerate this needless waste which has become emblematic of the failed CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mrs Figueiredo for trying to breathe life back into the corpse of this discredited policy, but I fear it may be too late for resuscitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We agree, too, with your recommendation that the export of fishing vessels to third countries should no longer be financed: as you are aware, we suggested this in our reform proposal. The Council postponed the application of this a little further than we would have liked, but the main thing is that from 2004 exports of fishing vessels with public aid will no longer be authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not share your judgement regarding the new fleet management tools, which were determined as part of the reform of the common fisheries policy: you seem to believe that these new tools will not bring a reduction in the overcapacity of the Community fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment briefly on the two main advances of this new management policy. The first is the system for the entry and exit of fishing vessels – which is an innovation that neither the industry nor the Member States were too happy to accept – and this system will be combined with the ban on replacing fishing capacities that have been withdrawn with public, national or Community financing. That will result in a gradual reduction of our fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">The second measure involves the systems to limit catches. This is obviously an essential component of the plans for the recovery of fish stocks and by limiting catches we will strengthen the efforts to reduce overcapacity. Our analysis is therefore very much in line with your own and is based on the weaknesses of the past. We believe that the measures adopted during the recent reform of the fisheries policy will allow us to respond, to a large extent, to the concerns you have expressed in your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, this report deals with the Commission's review of the multi-annual guidance programmes. Technically it covers the period up to 30 June 2002, but since Parliament is not going to do a report on the final situation as at 31 December, I will make some comments on the situation up to that date.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the fourth generation multi-annual guidance programme, a series of programmes dating back to 1983. They tried to exert some control over the size and distribution of EU fleets. They have lasted for 20 years altogether. Considering that their objective was to achieve a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation, and in the light of the advice coming from ICES over the past few days, it can be safely concluded that they have been a resounding failure.</p>
<p class="contents">To its credit, the Commission has proposed a far more comprehensive and important cut in fleet capacity than the Council was ever able to accept. For example, the agreed objectives for the Member States' combined fleets were so modest that the Community fleet as a whole was already smaller than the overall objectives, even before the MAGP IV entered into force. Some fleets required no reductions at all. Yet at the end of the programme in December 2002 only five of the 13 countries had met the objectives for all the different fleet segments.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain, often criticised this House, was one of them. Clearly the Member States did not have their heart in the exercise. Now the MAGPs themselves are being scrapped. While we recognise that they were ineffective and cumbersome to administer, at least they had the goal of reducing fleet capacity. What has been put in place in the so-called reform does not even do that. Each Member State has been allocated a certain capacity for fishing vessels in tonnage and kilowatts, but there is no requirement for that capacity to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner himself said, only if public money is used is there any requirement to reduce capacity. As fish stocks are decreasing in abundance faster than the fishing fleets chasing them, the future does not look bright for either the fish or the coastal communities and the people depending on the fishing industry for a living. This is going to cause a major socio-economic crisis. It is looming on the horizon. As Mr Stevenson has said, they are going to suffer endless hardship. But that is going to be the case if we do not realise what the problem is and how to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Lamy is Commissioner for trade, he may be interested in knowing how the EU engages in free trade with fishing vessels. During the period 1998 to 2001, at least 746 vessels were exported to third countries. The number could be many times greater but since most of the vessels had left the fleet, the Commission has no idea what happened to them. They were simply decommissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Of those 746 vessels, at least 38 were directly exported to known flag of convenience countries. There are even examples of shipowners being funded by the FIFG to export to flag of convenience countries. Even Mr Lamy would have to admit that it is difficult to have a more liberalised trade than that!</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem with the management of the MAGPs by the Commission relates to the waters beyond the European Union. A couple of years ago, the Commission allowed a rather large vessel, the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span> to join the Irish fleet, with the consequence that another vessel, the <span class="italic">Veronica</span>, was exported to a flag of convenience country, Panama. This was supposedly because the fish of Mauritania are or were plentiful. Earlier this year the Commission did a similar favour for the Dutch. This time they allowed the equivalent of three '<span class="italic">Atlantic Dawns'</span> into the Dutch register to fish the same fish off Mauritania. But the Commission's own scientific advice says that there should be no increase in fishing effort there, so I cannot see how this can be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers. In the case of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn </span>that vessel was illegal. What did the Commission do? It helped make it legal. It has made an illegal situation legal. It has done the same with the Dutch. It has now legalised an illegal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It sends out a clear signal to anyone else who wants to do this: basically break the law, ignore it, and the Commission will help you at the end of the day. That is the wrong signal to send out. It is clear that the Commission bends over backwards to accommodate shipowners of these huge supertrawlers. These are not the little coastal communities that will be affected, these are the huge business ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am appalled at Commissioner Byrne who also bent over backwards to help the owner of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span>, the world's biggest pelagic trawler, to get that fishing licence. I believe it was a breach of his duty as a Commissioner to act in the interests of an individual businessman from his own country. That should also be investigated. I would like to know how many more Commissioners are bending over backwards to facilitate specific business interests against the interests of the Community as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make a somewhat political remark: she belongs to a group that regularly calls for civil disobedience in a great number of spheres, but I notice that she is now very law-abiding. As soon as an entrepreneur does something wrong – something that is not quite compatible with the rules – a punishment must be imposed immediately. I think that that is a good discussion in itself: it is possible to discuss even with the European left on which issues we should or should not follow the government. I digress.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that it is right that the multi-annual guidance programmes be laid to rest. Four generations of MAGPs have failed to produce anything; this is not the way to approach the common fisheries policy. Indeed, I have opposed this approach ever since I joined Parliament, and I am pleased that the Commission recognises that, and also the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must not stand still. It is clear that there is an excess in capacity, and something must be done about it. There are more means than just reducing the size of a fleet, however. By this I mean the use of ‘days at sea’: we can limit the number of days spent at sea. In addition, quotas can be better monitored by means of the joint management of these by producer organisations. There are a good few possibilities, and, indeed, I wish to ask in this regard that the Commission maximise the use of the existing possibilities in its policy before resorting to further new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I should like to pledge my support for the Commission’s policy in this matter, as it is important that we establish a better grip on fleet size, possibly even with regard to going over from smaller to larger vessels in our fleets. With larger vessels it is often possible to put out to sea on more days, and sometimes that does not result in greater tonnage, but does lead to more actual fishing. In this regard, that very instrument – days at sea – coupled with a reduction in the capacity of fleets, could indeed be a very effective instrument for achieving a very productive approach, and also sustainable fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, our group can endorse the general thrust of this report, including after the amendments, and I await the Commissioner’s response with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only under this condition that the authorisation to which she refers was accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to demand full compliance with MAGPs by all Member States. Condoning anything less would amount to rewarding those who infringe Community legislation. We fail to understand how the behaviour of certain Fisheries Ministers continues to be tolerated. I refer to those Fisheries Ministers who agree to provisions in Council but then fail to comply with them or refuse to make data on compliance available.</p>
<p class="contents">Fisheries resources, the Community’s fisheries sector and the regions that depend on fishing would all be better off if the CFP pursued a long-term socio-economic approach that was not full of contradictions. There is no point in awarding subsidies for ships to be built only then to pay to have them scrapped. It would make more sense to allow them to be exported to third countries, in the context of cooperation between the Community fisheries sector and those of developing countries. The Group of the Party of European Socialists is committed to a long-term policy that combines adapting the fleet to resources with maintaining a sustainable level of fishing.

Three options are provided for sugar, but only one for olive oil, tobacco and cotton.</p>
<p class="contents">These three crops are cultivated in the same geographical area. They also have in common that they are labour-intensive and dependent on other associated economic activities. Furthermore, many of the holdings on which tobacco and cotton are cultivated cover only a small area.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the impact on the cultivation of these three crops is likely to be significant. Serious consequences can be anticipated regarding the area under cultivation, the number of holdings, employment and economic activity in producer areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of cotton, the Commission has already recognised the danger of the crop ceasing to be grown altogether. It has therefore proposed partial decoupling of aid. The circumstances surrounding olive oil and tobacco are similar, yet no such proposal has been made for these crops.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be interested to know what alternatives the Commission is contemplating for the area concerned should cultivation be reduced or cease altogether. I am particularly anxious about tobacco-producing areas. Doing away with tobacco growing seems to be part of some hidden agenda. I would also be interested to know from the Commission what it envisages the impact on tobacco imports will be, and whether it is of the opinion that consumption will decrease when the crop is no longer grown.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s communication also raises a number of major legal difficulties. In the case of oil, Council Regulation (EC) 1638/98 amending the common organisation of the market in fats and oils provided that: ‘no aid may be paid to olive growers in respect of additional olive trees or the relevant areas planted after 1 May 1998’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Commission’s communication suggests that all aid to olive oil would be calculated on the basis of aid received in the period 2000-2002. It should be borne in mind that an olive grove only starts to come into production five years after it is planted. It only comes into full production ten years after it is planted. According to the proposal in the Commission’s communication, olive trees planted between 1990 and 1 May 1998 would be entitled to aid, but the implication is that such aid would be less than the aid awarded to trees in other groves. This raises serious doubts as to whether the guidelines outlined by the Commission are compatible with the principle of legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the 1998 Council Regulation provided for guaranteed national quantities. Exceeding these quantities would incur penalties, and entitlement to aid would be reduced. Furthermore, aid to olive trees planted between 1988 and 1 May 1998 would also be reduced if the approach outlined in the Commission’s communication were adopted. In this case too, there could potentially be a conflict with the principles of legal certainly and equal treatment of workers. Commissioner, I would be interested to learn the Commission’s views on this subject. I wonder if it is aware of the danger of one of the affected producers challenging the regulation in the Court of Justice and rendering it ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">The common market organisation for cotton is based on Protocol 4 annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece. It therefore has the force of a treaty. Paragraph 2 provides for the establishment of a Community regime with a view to maintaining the production of cotton in those regions of the Community where it represents a significant part of the agricultural economy. The aim was to enable producers to have a fair income and to stabilise the market, so as to improve structures as far as supply and demand are concerned. Paragraph 2.1 provided for the establishment of a Community regime aimed principally at maintaining cotton production in those areas of the Community where it is important for the agricultural economy. In addition, paragraph 3 provides for the granting of aid to production under the regime envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid outlined by the Commission will not make it possible to maintain production in parts of the Union where the whole social situation is very finely balanced. Furthermore, the consequences of decoupling aid run counter to those sections of the Act of Accession of Greece I quoted earlier. They also run counter to what was agreed in 1979, ratified in 1986, and enshrined in texts that are a primary source of Community legislation. Commissioner, I do wonder whether the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, really does believe that its proposals comply with those Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to voice my astonishment at the fact that the European Parliament has not seen fit to express its opinion on the Commission’s communication by means of a resolution. If the Commission forwards a communication to the European Parliament, the latter should at the very least produce a response to the contents. Furthermore, this is an unprecedented decision. To date, the European Parliament had always responded with a report or a resolution to communications prior to reform of the CMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, as Mr Jové Peres as has just said, we have placed on the table a new stage in the process of the reform of our agricultural policy concerning cotton, olive oil and tobacco, with a view to bringing these areas into line with the general system, which is now that of the common agricultural policy, with the same objectives: no longer supporting production but supporting producers’ incomes by transferring a significant proportion of the current expenditure on production to a single farm payment scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">As has just been said, it is true that the cotton, olive oil and tobacco sectors have very specific characteristics and that their production is concentrated in regions which, in general, are less developed. That is why the Commission has taken account of the economic, social and environmental effects of total decoupling in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards cotton, we calculated the proportion to be transferred to the new single decoupled payment, which totals 60%, with a view to allowing cotton production to continue, whilst enabling producers to achieve margins similar to those of competing crops. However, in order to reduce the negative effects on the environment, we are also proposing maximum area limits, which are in fact below the areas planted during the reference period for the allocation of the new area payment. We must therefore expect a decrease in cotton production and we are aware that this reform will require adjustments on the part of the sector. That is why we have also proposed that it should be accompanied by rural development measures. Thus, there will be an impact, and that impact will have to be accompanied by rural development measures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to olive oil, at present we are also seeking to achieve better market orientation and greater stability of farmers’ incomes on the one hand and the preservation of olive groves where they offer a clear social and environmental advantage on the other hand. We have therefore proposed that the Member States should retain 40% of their current aid for payments linked to production in order to finance, in the form of national envelopes, aid for the preservation of olive grove that offer these advantages. This aid is intended to cover the costs of maintaining the olive trees, independent of any support for production or harvests. Because we are aware of the diversity of regional situations, we feel that the Member States should have the capacity to establish the levels of the payments so that they can adapt the amount of aid according to the local situation in order to ensure that it reaches the areas where it is most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards tobacco, our proposals are also based on an extended impact assessment. We analysed all of the direct and indirect implications of the current market organisation, from the point of view of production and from the point of view of the impact of various options on agricultural incomes and on employment in the different regions where tobacco is produced. We consulted producers, we consulted local representatives in producing regions during a forum which brought together all of the interested parties, and we reached the conclusion that the reorientation of tobacco production was essential. We must not forget that even now the revenue of many farms does not cover the variable production costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our study also shows that this reorientation of production may, of course, have a negative impact on employment in the sectors at both ends that are linked to the tobacco economy, even though we do not have any precise assessment of the global and local impact. There is no doubt that tobacco production is important for the economy of certain regions today and there is no doubt that its disappearance will have consequences from that point of view, which we hope to limit. Therefore, unlike the proposals for cotton and olive oil, we have adopted a specific approach which first and foremost involves entirely decoupling small farms – those where production is below 3.5 tonnes – in order to ensure immediately that these small structures continue to receive the full income support they currently receive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as restructuring is concerned, we are proposing additional financing, by transferring a proportion of the funds currently used for direct aid for production to a restructuring envelope, which would bolster the existing rural development funds of producing regions, thus helping them to support diversification.</p>
<p class="contents">This form of redeployment, which involves using existing money to benefit restructuring, forms part of the Commission’s proposals, on the understanding that it would be up to producers and those involved in the regions concerned to lay down the most apt measures from among the array of “rural development” measures available.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, our proposals in these three sectors take account both of the general rules, which we hope are now those of the common agricultural policy, and specific characteristics. These three sectors differ a great deal from the other major crops, they differ a great deal from each other, and our proposals seek to reflect this diversity, whilst remaining faithful to our general principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might well wonder if it really is so difficult to understand the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I refer to Mr Alemanno, the Italian Minister. He spoke eloquently about the social importance of retaining this crop, notably in Spain, Greece and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tobacco imports into the European Union are bound to increase. The President of the Agriculture Council has argued along these lines. The Spanish Agriculture Minister is of the same opinion. So too are the authorities in my constituency, Extremadura. It is one of the regions set to suffer most if this body blow to rural society is actually delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out yet again that the move could have devastating consequences for the region. Some 20 000 families would be affected. Loss of income would be of the order of EUR 200 million. I must also state that no alternative use of the land has yet been identified, other than leaving it uncultivated.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make some summary comments. The Commissioner has endeavoured to demonstrate that the Commission undertook thorough research. It should therefore be in a position to provide figures for the drop in tobacco consumption in the Union following reform. It should also be able to provide information on the tariffs to be imposed in order to restrict imports of tobacco into the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the Commission took careful note of events in the House this morning during the vote on the budget. Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 723 and 338. The amendments would have resulted in drastic reductions of tobacco premiums. Once again, Parliament has demonstrated its understanding of the social damage a cut in premiums would inflict on so many rural European families. I must reiterate that there is nothing else they can grow.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commissioner for Agriculture has feelings. I would like to hope he has taken this political message on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am bound make an initial observation. It is that yet again this debate has been characterised by blatant discrimination against traditional Mediterranean crops as regards reform of their production. Mr Jove Peres highlighted this earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the sugar sector, there is a document outlining a number of options. It is due to be discussed and worked on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. A decision will then be taken in plenary. By contrast, the only chance of debating the implications of the communication for the other three Mediterranean crops will be following an oral question today. This will not even lead to a resolution in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">There does not appear to be any justification for such differences in formal procedures. Furthermore, discrimination and variable treatment are evident in the substance, not just in the formalities. Changes are in train within the common agricultural policy. Price support mechanisms are being phased out and replaced with others designed to support income. The Commission itself is on record as stating that this concludes the 1992 decoupling. Transitional periods of between 15 and 17 years are therefore involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, immediate changes are demanded in these three sectors. This means that for cotton, olive oil and tobacco, there is to be a sudden change from aid linked directly to production to totally decoupled aid. There can be no justification for failure to provide an opportunity for us to discuss a suitable transitional period with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment generated in the sectors in question is of crucial importance. I refer not only to the jobs linked to cultivation of the crops, but also to jobs dependent on the processing industry, jobs in the service industries and in general to the wealth created in rural areas. Loss of production and winding up production in these sectors will have dramatic economic consequences. The result will be large-scale rural exodus.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to be flexible. There must be an opportunity to discuss the various options contained in the proposals made. Impact assessments are needed too. I would remind the Commissioner that no impact assessment has yet been undertaken for the cotton sector. I also appeal to the Commission to be flexible when it comes to discussion of transitional adjustment periods appropriate for these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I should like to call on the Commissioner to provide a clear explanation of the importance of Community cotton production in the global market. I do so in my capacity as rapporteur for the cotton sector and in the wake of Cancun. The Union accounts for 0.5% of global cotton production. It does not grant any export refunds whatsoever. Imports are totally free. They are not subject to tariffs of any kind. Furthermore, 80% of the cotton used in the Union is imported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patakis (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I hereby state from the outset that, if the Commission's new proposals are implemented, they will be the <span class="italic">coup de grace </span>for Mediterranean products. The Greek countryside and three of the country's basic products, which are grown by 75% of farmers, will receive a mortal blow so as to serve the new plans and commitments of the CAP, the WTO and the enlargement of the European Union, in other words the instructions of big business and the multinationals, which are ordering that tobacco farming be wiped out, cotton farming be cut back, olive oil farming be abandoned, products in which the European Union is highly deficient. They are indifferent to the consequences, which will be painful not just for the farmers, but also for workers in processing, warehouses and so on, as well as for anyone with professional connections with these products and numerous small- and medium-sized businesses active in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is cruelly proposing with no turning back to abolish tobacco farming and subsidies by 2013. The chronicle of a death announced before Gothenburg. On the pretext of protecting health, it is wiping out European tobacco farming, tobacco farmers and, for Greece, all the activity surrounding the farming, trading and processing of tobacco which, as you know, is concentrated mainly on small lots in problematic mountain areas. The highest hypocrisy and cynicism, given that it does not at the same time propose to abolish the European tobacco industries which, of course, will continue to import raw tobacco unimpeded from third countries and to speculate by making and exporting cigarettes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union of 370 million citizens is being called on to stop financing 347 000 tonnes of tobacco, while the USA of 263 million citizens continue to increase their production of 586 000 tonnes, a large proportion of which is imported into the European Union. What is clear is that tobacco farmers will receive less money, referred to in future as decoupling subsidies but in practice they will be scant unemployment benefits and pseudo-compensation for abolishing tobacco farming from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cotton is concerned, so that the cotton farmers do not delude themselves, the Commission clearly states in its introductory report that the new reform of the COM is being carried out because the objective of reducing the price and reducing the cultivated areas and production, for which provision was made in the 2001 reform, has not yet been achieved. In two years, cotton farming in Greece has been reduced by 70 000 hectares, with a significant reduction in the price of cotton and in producers' incomes, due to the increase in coresponsibility levies and all the absurd measures for prohibiting and limiting the number of hectares cultivated and the return per hectare. 250 000 tonnes of two years' Greek production did not receive any subsidies and only obtained the international price which, as we know, is fixed by the multinationals. The same prices are obtained by the developing countries, which the European Union is supposedly doing its utmost for. However, the Commission is demanding even greater reductions under a new disastrous reform. With a 'because I say so', it has set a low ceiling of 34 000 hectares for Greece and similar cutbacks for Spain and Portugal in a bid to lower the ceiling even further with the measures it is taking. The Commission proposals for cotton even overturn Protocol ΙV, as Mr Jové Peres mentioned, of the 1981 Act of Accession of Greece to the EEC on the basis of which the guarantee of a minimum price for producers is laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor does a proven healthy product, such as olive oil, escape the European Union's eternal anti-farming policy. Hypocritical and groundless arguments are being used to wipe out olive oil farming. A spirit of hypocrisy and mockery at the expense of olive farmers prevails in the proposals in the Commission's report on oil. Having stated that there is a serious risk of cutting care for olive trees on a broad scale, while those who wrote and inspired the proposals are obviously conscious of what will happen with them, measures are being proposed which will achieve what, theoretically, they do not wish to happen, in other words 60% decoupling.</p>
<p class="contents">These three Mediterranean products are victims of the mid-term reform of the CAP which is strangling farming. The catastrophic CAP is turning into an even more efficient mechanism for wiping out farmers, especially small- and medium-sized farmers. The constant reference to environmental protection is being used as an alibi to reduce farm production. The hypocrisy becomes crystal clear from the anti-tobacco rather than the anti-smoking campaign, at a time when the cultivation of modified crops is being promoted. These proposals are not open to amendment or improvement. That is why, if they are not withdrawn as they stand, they will come up against the combative, fighting opposition of the agricultural world in order to avert their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">When you expressed your position, Mr Lamy, you said that you had also come to an agreement with the producers. The only thing you did not do was to come to an agreement with the producers, the real producers. You came to an agreement with those who have nothing to do with production, nothing to do with the products and, mainly, you came to an agreement with the multinationals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That much is obvious to Parliament, the Commission and to those affected. When all is said and done, the fundamental objective of agricultural aid is to provide people in rural areas with a reasonable income. They will then be deterred from leaving their land and flocking to the cities or to richer parts of Europe. It should be borne in mind that we are striving to attain two of the Union’s fundamental ambitions. These are to achieve territorial balance within Europe and to prevent the depopulation and desertification of rural areas. Sadly, there is considerable experience of the latter in Aragon, the region I represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this is what the common agricultural policy should be aiming at, especially in the case of crops with such social importance. It is essential to encourage people in rural areas to remain on the land in their regions in order to prevent the desertification of parts of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, my efforts have been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">I put a specific question to the Commission yesterday and received a reply today. This reiterated that the reform will not have a negative impact on the income of the holdings. The Commission has also reiterated here and now that the reform will not have a negative impact on producers’ incomes either. To date, however, the Commission has failed to respond to the question concerning the effect of the reform on employment. You are yourself on record as stating that no specific assessment exists, Commissioner. I have received similar information in written answers, despite indications that 14 Directorates-General have been exercised on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Lamy, I feel it is irresponsible to undertake such a far-reaching reform without any information on the implications for jobs. Some 100 000 directly related jobs are at risk in the sector, together with 500 000 indirectly related ones. I believe the Commission does actually know this. I suggest it is withholding the figures because it is fully aware of their alarming proportions. I suggest too that the Commission is fully aware of the devastating consequences of the reform for employment and the regions affected. I can certainly forecast them myself, and so can all those who understand the sector and work in it. We are all also aware that the accompanying measures will prove inadequate. Incidentally, these measures are not additional, Commissioner. They come from the producers themselves. In any case, they will be insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, producers are up in arms in Extremadura, the region I represent. They rightly believe the reform to be brutal, radical and unjustified. They feel they are about to be sacrificed in the interests of a cause ridden with misinterpretations. They find themselves in an unbearable situation. They are angry because they have been at the receiving end of hypocritical and misleading statements. Allow me to remind you, Commissioner, that in June the Commission gave assurances that reform would be undertaken taking account of the social situation in the least-favoured regions. Allow me to recall also that in June Parliament and the Council were instrumental in obtaining a political compromise. This entailed Mr Fischler abandoning the maximalist approach of total decoupling. Despite all of this, there is now a proposal for total decoupling of the most labour-intensive CMO.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I join with previous speakers in urging the Commission to reflect. Before adopting these regulations, I beg you to spare a thought for the anguish of those families and the future of the regions concerned. They must not be sacrificed on the altar of hypocrisy. I am put in mind of that excellent account of hypocrisy provided by the famous French dramatist Molière in his play <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The age-old imbalance between Mediterranean crop production and crop production in the rest of Europe needed a different approach, whereas we are faced with the reform of Mediterranean crop production after the failure of Cancun and with a view to enlargement. Our concern is growing, with the fear that these two processes may exert further, unendurable pressure on our Mediterranean crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concerns are, indeed, extremely serious regarding tobacco, even though everyone has to take on board the European Union’s principle of protecting health: these measures will cause extreme economic and social upheaval and result in foreign tobacco imports being increased to 100 %, so I certainly feel that greater caution would be in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus my remarks on one of the three crops that we are discussing because I feel that it is a case of enforced coupling. Each of these products is, indeed, special and deserved to be treated separately rather than them all being placed under the same umbrella. I am referring, in particular, to olive oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is a desire to reduce the requirement for support based on the amount produced. I would take the liberty of emphasising, however, that this condiment enhances food consumption across the world and, since it is a product which is good for health, there is increasing demand for it. I therefore feel that we have two major problems: guaranteeing a safety net for income and boosting quality policies. We will discuss these proposals after the legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">You quite rightly refer us to the decisions of the individual states, but we must also consider a number of general criteria such as employment. I put it to you: how can you reconcile the provision of incentives for the quality of this crop with the ongoing possibility of mixing olive oil with other fats? It is this possibility of mixing that causes a vertical drop in prices and is a blow to farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note that the choice of speakers means that only Members with reservations concerning these reforms have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with tobacco. It has already been discussed, and I have some memories of my own from just over 10 years ago in this very House. Given the tensions that could be noted here and there between the agricultural policy and the health policy, one wondered whether we should review our options. So this debate has not come about all of a sudden: it has not just landed in our laps, we have been considering it for years, and you, in Parliament, have been discussing it for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission would indeed have been Tartuffe had it not drawn conclusions from these debates that have been held over the years and I believe that we are drawing the conclusions in a very clear manner. In this case, we are proposing a redeployment, a restructuring of this crop towards alternative crops. A clear option is being taken. We know that this will require considerable efforts on the part of a number of tobacco producers today, at both ends of the scale, but we are putting proposals, including financial proposals, on the table that allow this restructuring to take place due to the necessity that we have again discussed over the past years.</p>
<p class="contents">The same does not apply, however, to olive oil and to cotton, where the aim is not to restructure nor to convert or guide production or producers to other products. We want to maintain a number of cotton crops and many olive groves in the European Union by avoiding the depopulation or desertification of the zones in question, but also by correcting the effects of the current aid systems from the point of view of production, the environment and the finances of the European Union. That is why the Commission has presented an option, somewhere in the middle, that does not take decoupling as far as the measures adopted in Luxembourg this year for other products. It is, in fact, in order to take account of the particular sensitivity of a number of these regions that we have not gone as far as we could have gone in theory, and I can guarantee this, to have participated in the Commission’s discussions on the proposals by our friend Mr Fischler on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the difference in the treatment of sugar. Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, be assured that the reform of the CMO in sugar has begun as we have put forward three options. This is an initial discussion phase that must take place because, it must be said, it is the first time that the substance is being discussed, which is not the case for tobacco, cotton or olive oil. The Commission’s formal proposals will be presented next year, once the debate on the three options has been held with the main parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Mr Jové Peres, who was worried about the impact regarding aid to olive trees depending on the year of planting, I will say that as far as I can tell, this is not a real problem since the maximum guaranteed quantities have already been exceeded, which means that this does not have any impact on the amount of the aid in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is useful to recall the background to the current situation in that country. It is now ten years since the murder of Mr Ndadaye, its first democratically elected President. Since then, Burundi has been ravaged by civil war. The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups. Sadly, it resulted in almost 300 000 deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">A peace process is currently under way. Initially, this was led by the President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, and later by Mr Mandela. The terms of the process provide for a cessation of armed conflict. This was to be followed by the various stages of an electoral process and transition to democracy. An equitable power sharing system was to be established, together with a rotating Presidency passing from Hutus to Tutsis every 18 months. All these arrangements are contained in the August 2000 Arusha Peace Agreement which resulted in the present transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from the Committee on Development and Cooperation visited Burundi between 22 and 27 June of last year. On 9 July 2003 the President of Burundi appeared before the Committee on Development and Cooperation. On 8 October an agreement on effective implementation of the cease-fire was reached between the Government and the main faction of the so-called Forces for the Defence of Democracy led by Pierre Nkurunziza. Unfortunately, armed confrontations between groups such as the FDD and the FNL have continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The African Union has dispatched the African Mission In Burundi peace-keeping force known as the AMIB. It consists of 3 000 soldiers from Ethiopia, South Africa and Mozambique. The force is tasked with assisting in the disarmament and demobilisation of rebel soldiers and with their reintegration back into society. In addition, if peace is maintained, it should be easier to for humanitarian aid supplies to reach displaced persons and the population in war-torn areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The last of the AMIB soldiers arrived in Burundi last Sunday. The force is financed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Mozambique. Nonetheless, there appear to be financial difficulties over keeping it in the field. At the same time, the problems in the south of Kivu are ongoing. Confrontations are still taking place and they represent a threat to peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union suspended aid to Burundi in January 1997. Aid was reinstated, however, following the response to the peace negotiations. EUR 48 million was granted for a rehabilitation programme aimed mainly at supporting the return of displaced persons and demobilisation. The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation. In addition, institutional support amounting to EUR 2 million was awarded to the Ministry of Economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further EUR 150 million was allocated at the Paris Conference in 2001. This included an ECHO programme for the return of Burundian refugees from Tanzania supported by UNHCR.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union funds amounting to EUR 285 million are currently available to Burundi. Additional funds will be allocated under the ninth EDF. We would like this resolution to serve as a reminder to the authorities in Burundi that they need to involve women in the peace process. We believe women have an important part to play in the latter. We also encourage neighbouring countries to support the peace process in Burundi. Finally, we hope to be able to rejoice that peace has come about in this small country in central Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a long time, in this region, the land of the great lakes, we have seen very violent conflicts, even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions, which, if we merely apply short-term remedies, will only keep on recurring. That is why it matters that we should start by clarifying terminology, for the words that we use here are often not the same ones that are used in the region itself. We talk in terms of armies, parties, or refugees, but these are, as a rule, ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army, a party or as refugees. What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups, with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces, in the administration and, as the amendment so rightly puts it, in the justice system above all. This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity, rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role, for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans, too, to spend centuries smashing each others’ skulls in, and such things are still going on in Europe today. We really do, then, have to approach this task with the proper sensitivity and humility; we cannot expect people who were doing terrible things to each other only a few years or months ago to be able, within only a few months, to behave as if nothing had happened. That is why we need this process; although we must waste no time in getting on with it, we need sensitivity, we need time, and we need to be present. That is why we need civil servants, lawyers and also officers from the armed services to act as advisors to both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ethnic opposition is constantly intensified by the leaders of armed gangs, official or unofficial, that were created and supported, it must be remembered, for decades by the former Belgian colonising power and by the French tutelary power. The resolution provides a great deal of moralistic and paternalistic advice for the Burundi leadership, the leaders of the factions and its neighbours. Yet more than advice is needed, as the European powers have an overwhelming responsibility for what has happened and what is happening in Burundi, just as they have a more general responsibility for all of Africa, of which Rwanda and Burundi are to some extent the sad symbols.</p>
<p class="contents">They have an overwhelming responsibility for having ruined Africa through the trafficking of slaves, through colonialist pillaging and then through another form of pillaging, which continues today. While Parliament provides moralising advice, the major British, French and Belgian capitalist groups and many others continue to take their stipend, even from the poorest countries, and the little information that filters through from many parts of Africa where ethnic conflicts and mining riches go side by side show that it is very rare to find a situation where behind the local warlords there are no capitalist groups trying to get their hands on the riches the land has to offer. Rather than improving the fate of the local population, these riches are the cause of its misfortune. I am well aware that material aid, even a great deal of it, would not be enough to overcome all of the problems that are an extension of the past. However, if Europe wanted to, it could provide sufficient aid to allow the refugees to return, provide the Burundi people with acceptable housing and living conditions, and enable them to build infrastructures, hospitals and schools, thus creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution does allude to aid, in particular for the economic reconstruction of the country, but it gives much more attention to the financing of African forces working to restore and maintain peace and the despatch of a mission of European senior military officials to meet their counterparts in the Burundi regular army. Yet in neighbouring Rwanda some years ago, the presence of French senior military officials not only did not prevent the genocide but actually encouraged it and perhaps even armed the butchers. Thus, even if this resolution had some effect, it would certainly not wipe away the traces of blood that the presence of major European capital has left in Burundi and more generally in the African continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill, maim, abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit, at times forcibly, child combatants. As was agreed last December, and has already been mentioned here, it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Green EFA group have also called for judicial and army reform, as provided for in the Arusha accords of 2000, and an end to impunity for those who continue to perpetrate human rights abuses. We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission, as has been called for by so many in civil society. We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community, especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country, for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government. This is a challenge that the EU must rise to. But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses – not just in Burundi, but in so many other parts of the world. This is something that must be a priority for the EU, we cannot allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses. We should not be involved with arms in the first place, to be honest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To rebuild national unity and reconciliation after those long years of civil war, it is vital to ensure that people, individuals and communities who suffered gross human rights abuses are acknowledged and provided with reparation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I support the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission, of the kind set up in South Africa or Sierra Leone for instance. It will allow cases of extreme violations of human rights committed by all parties to be identified and investigated. It also provides victims with support to ensure that their dignity is restored and that healing and rehabilitation can occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing the accused to trial under the legal, judicial process strengthens the rule of law and is vital in breaking the cycle of vengeance created by widespread rapes and killings committed with impunity.

This Protocol is in our eyes an important step towards consolidating the peace process in Burundi. It shows that many of the local actors are prepared to respect the Arusha Agreement as a framework for the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the author of the resolution we are discussing this afternoon, we are also concerned about the exclusion from the process of the last rebel group, the FNL, and we feel that it is important to continue to encourage all initiatives to launch the negotiations between the FNL and the transitional government in Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done so far? For the most part, we have supported the peace process as far as possible, deploying a number of instruments to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation, including food aid, financial contributions and the despatch of observers from the African Union. Pending the establishment of the facility to support peace, we are preparing, in collaboration with the African Union, an emergency project to maintain peace in Burundi, which totals around EUR 25 million. Naturally, we hope that the entire donor community will stand alongside us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working towards the economic reconstruction of Burundi with a rehabilitation programme, totalling just under EUR 50 million, which is designed to ensure the physical rehabilitation of the economic and social infrastructures that have unfortunately been destroyed by the civil war, as in other parts of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In August, we signed an indicative national programme with Burundi, as part of the ninth EDF, which amounts to around EUR 70 million, part of which is naturally allocated to the restoration of the political institutions in the transitional phase. Therefore, in our view, support for the peace process and a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the country are the two objectives that the Union must continue to strive towards in order to support the little progress being made as regards the peace process in that country, which sadly continues to be troubled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member of this House, I then rub my eyes in astonishment when I see President Chirac of France referring to the figure known as Turkmenbashi as ‘Father of all Turkmen’ and ‘my best and great friend’. He did this on 13 October on the occasion of the presentation of the new French Ambassador’s letters of credence in Ashkabad.</p>
<p class="contents">In his letter to President Niyazov, President Chirac also expressed the desire to consolidate and deepen the warm relations between France and Turkmenistan. Apparently, in Paris, oil and natural gas interests take priority over everything. Just compare that with our resolution. What was that we were saying about a single European voice?</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the Member States of the European Union are discussing the undeniable fact of the Christian tradition of the Occident, sincere Christians in Turkmenistan are having to fear for their lives daily. It is their certain knowledge and solace that God is watching over His church everywhere. That does not alter the fact, however, that we have a political responsibility towards their oppressors.

Well, there is nothing just about life in Turkmenistan, but justice for the Turkmen people is what this debate is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">President Niyazov renamed himself. He renamed the days of the week. He named the months of the year after his national heroes, starting with himself and his mother. He has built lavish palaces; he has erected statues of himself while his people remain impoverished. From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant. Since 1999 he has been president for life. In November last year the worst repression of all followed an attack on him.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenistan has become a land of torture and imprisonment, of death in custody, of intolerance towards political and religious views. The press is muzzled, human rights organisations are barred and opposition is driven abroad. Our resolution lists names, and we demand the release of those names, the end of ill-treatment in those cases where they are actually still alive, and access to them for the Red Cross. But they are the tip of an iceberg that needs to be exposed. I trust that the Commission will do just that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation on Central Asia covers all the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia. Last May we were in Uzbekistan, the beautiful and historic country of Tamburlaine. We were made welcome and we saw some improvements in human rights and a willingness to open doors. But two days after we left Mr Ruslan Sharipov was arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Ruslan Sharipov is a journalist who wrote about police and government corruption. He was arrested on charges of homosexual conduct, criminalised in that country under Article 120 of the criminal code, in contradiction with the provisions of the ICCPR ratified by Uzbekistan. On 28 August masked men kidnapped and severely beat his public defender, Surat Ikramov.</p>
<p class="contents">In September Mr Sharipov got out by letter allegations of his ill-treatment and of how he was threatened in prison by police and prison officers. In September the charge was reduced, but only reduced. He should never have been charged. He should be released now, and I ask the Commission to intervene in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">While we were in Uzbekistan, we also met the British Ambassador, Craig Murray. He is a fearless diplomat who told us the truth as he saw it. Perhaps he was unwise to do so, but he was right to do so. At a meeting in Tashkent on 17 October he said: 'I believe that people are born with an instinct for liberty and that freedom and democracy come naturally to people everywhere once they are given the chance'. Well, the British Government did not endorse or commend him. It summoned him home for treatment. I ask the Commission to issue a diplomatic 'habeus corpus' challenge to the British Foreign Secretary: restore a good man to his post and the gainers will be the Uzbek people and their leaders, but also the good name of British diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been quoted by other fellow Members, Turkmenistan is ‘one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world’. The situation in other Central Asian countries is perhaps a little better, but there, too, the human rights situation is abominable. Does that mean that Europe should ignore Central Asia? My answer is ‘no’, and for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the strategic goals. Ignoring that region will not do. It is not in Europe’s interests to let those countries, which export corruption and instability as well as oil and gas, remain ‘rogue states’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second reason, too, which is the necessity – already mentioned by some fellow Members – of doing business regarding the large quantities of oil and gas in that region. To some politicians, however, and sadly also some fellow MEPs, that means that we have to do business first and foremost, and that we should just mention human rights, but on no account focus attention on them too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past, when, on account of our need for oil from the Middle East, we kept quiet about the human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. It is true that Europe needs oil and gas, including from that region, but that also means that those countries need us, and this provides us with the opportunity of giving priority to the human rights situation – to improving it, in particular – in our dealings with those countries, and only then speaking about oil. Referring to EU policy in Kosovo I would say: ‘standards before oil’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are both members of the delegation on Central Asia, and it is partly thanks to him and his great commitment that we are able to put this kind of issue back on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin with Turkmenistan. I am still rapporteur for a new cooperation agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan. Parliament, along with the Commission, has stated that it does not actually want to conclude that agreement, nor does it want to discuss it. There is every reason for this. As Mr Bowis and other fellow Members have already stated, it is perfectly clear, looking at the current situation, that that regime is unacceptable. At the same time, however, we have to think about what we can do for the people of Turkmenistan. We believe that Parliament must make an urgent appeal for the Red Cross to be able to visit the prisoners again in any event, for us to be able to resume good contact with the NGOs, and for those NGOs to have some freedom once again in those countries. We must stand up for the people – including politicians and human rights activists – who are currently incarcerated. We must stand up for freedom of belief. It is too absurd for words that only a certain form of Islam, and only the Orthodox Church, still have some degree of freedom, or in any event still enjoy a measure of protection, while all the other groups, both Christian and non-Christian, lack that protection. This is unacceptable, because people and religion belong together.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a number of the other countries mentioned, I should like to point out that, in spring of this year, we also discussed a resolution on Kazakhstan. That led to intensive talks between our delegation and parliamentary delegations from Kazakhstan, and improvements were introduced on a number of items. We are still finding ourselves disappointed on many counts, however: legal procedures, freedom of the press, and also freedom of organisation. I hope that these first steps that Kazakhstan has made in the right direction are not the last, but instead that further pressure, including on the part of the European Union, will lead to improvements in the situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a passionate plea for a new cooperation agreement with Tajikistan. Fortunately, the Commission is currently preparing an agreement for that country, too, which is an extremely good thing, because we must keep close to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis has already described the situation in Uzbekistan, and I have nothing to add.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves Kyrgyzstan. The present resolution rightly levels a number of criticisms, but, at the same time, we have here a country that deserves our warm support, because it is trying, with ups and downs, to build a democracy, despite having no resources and no oil. There should be criticism where criticism is due, but, even more importantly, support where support is due. I also wish to express to the Commission my hope that, in coming years, when it comes to Central Asia, the European Union will perhaps give a little extra support to a country such as this, in particular, which has no oil and no resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our analysis is therefore the same: the situation is serious in relation to respect for human rights.

<p class="contents">As regards the other countries of Central Asia – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan – which you have just mentioned, at both EU level and Member State level, we continue to stress that the international commitments concerning human rights must be respected, and we do this within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the bilateral relations between the Union and these countries, we do the same, and we have done so publicly for all of these democracy problems in Central Asia by cooperating with other international bodies working with us on this issue, be it the United Nations, the OSCE or the Commission on Human Rights.

To achieve lasting peace in Nepal, an open and democratic society, and progress and prosperity for all, all sides must honour the armistice of 19 January as well as the code of conduct which was signed by both the Maoist insurgents and the government on 13 March 2003. The announcement yesterday that the Maoist rebels will no longer carry out political killings, or destroy public utilities or infrastructure is just a crumb of comfort. Sadly, since the breakdown of the ceasefire, 211 people have lost their lives. We must ensure that we support and promote democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Nepal. The recent opening of an EC delegation office in Katmandu is a welcome boost to EU-Nepal relations and cooperation. We must ensure that we do all we can on the ground to help those suffering directly and indirectly from the unrest.</p>
<p class="contents">We should increase our financial assistance in Nepal and we must ensure that the main goal is the eradication of poverty and provision of universal health and education services. These underlying causes of conflict must remain the target of all EU cooperation assistance to the country. The Commission must work in Nepal through all stages of the conflict, from supplying humanitarian aid for those suffering, to ensuring that conflict resolution and prevention programmes are launched to prevent further violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the call in the resolution for the appointment of an EU special representative for Nepal. Such a representative could work to ensure that assistance is provided to the Bhutanese refugee camps. The UNHCR decision to phase out assistance for these camps is worrying and comes at a time when Nepal needs continuing rather than diminishing support. Although Nepal has sheltered many Tibetan and Bhutanese refugees over the years, the deportation of 18 Tibetans to Tibet a few months ago is a worrying development. The well being of all refugees needs to be guaranteed. Peace will only be achieved in Nepal through the democratic process. The EU should help this process and help the Nepalese to build a better future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As long ago as March, both sides were given a code of conduct, whereupon rebel leaders were released from prison. Three rounds of negotiations resulted in the Maoists abandoning their demand for the abolition of the monarchy. The government produced a framework for reform of the state; I have its road map and objectives in my hand as I speak. It provides for round table conferences involving all parties, as well as prompt elections to the national parliament, new structures featuring regional self-government, the introduction of the market economy and education and employment rights for ethnic groups and people with disabilities, all of which adds up to a substantial package.</p>
<p class="contents">In August 2003, though, the Maoists ended the ceasefire, since which time three hundred people have been killed, twenty-five of them last weekend alone, and acts of intimidation, extortion, serious fighting and murders have become daily occurrences in Nepal. For the first time, foreigners have been abducted and shots fired at tourists. In this country, so heavily dependent on tourism, the situation is becoming more tragic. The Group of the European People’s Party calls on the Maoists to renew the ceasefire once and for all and to return to the negotiating table. Should the two sides need a mediator from outside, the EU is eminently capable of performing that role, we Europeans enjoying a high degree of acceptance throughout South-East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Council to appoint a special ambassador to Nepal, with which, Commissioner Lamy, the Commission must build up the EU’s relations. One first and important step would be for the staff complement in the new office in Katmandu to be increased. Although putting an end to the civil war is the first priority, at no time must respect for human rights be neglected. Democracy must be extended, reforms acceptable to people at the grass roots must be implemented, and minorities must be treated with respect, particularly the Bhutanese refugees in the camps that Parliament’s delegation to SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) visited, the funding of which by the UNHCR is evidently no longer certain.</p>
<p class="contents">The minorities also include refugees from Tibet, who have been obliged to leave their homeland in fear of their lives, and who pass through Nepal on their way to India. According to the information I have received, the handing over to the Chinese of eighteen Tibetans was an exceptional occurrence – let us hope that it remains one. The Nepalese government must guarantee that deportations will be prevented, and all refugees from Bhutan and Tibet must be guaranteed protection under international human rights agreements.</p>

This formed a fertile breeding ground for a Maoist insurgency, which claimed 7 000 lives. In January of this year, a ceasefire was agreed, which came to an end in August, but the negotiations then ended immediately. Since then, again according to the sources available to me, there have been more than 800 deaths, mainly Maoists and poor farmers and villagers. The deaths, on 13 October, of four students caught in the crossfire between Maoists and the army are the latest outrage.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Nepal receives supplies of arms from the United States on a massive scale, aid from India, military aid from the United Kingdom and other countries, and supplies of arms from Belgium, which even amended its Arms Act in order to be able to supply those arms. More than half of the revenues on which the country survives are now derived from foreign aid. The government lacks any democratic legitimacy; power rests with the King and the army. Thanks to those supplies of arms, the government has evidently chosen to halt the dialogue and to opt for what is known as the military solution: stamping out the rebels and so-called rebels – poor villagers – by force of arms. Human rights are trampled on with impunity in the process, as the British representative, Sir Jeffrey James, found on the scene. Every possible means must be employed in an attempt to get the parties back around the negotiating table. Supplies of arms must cease, and those who think that arms can effect a solution here will see nothing but the total destruction of the country. Even more children will be tricked into leaving their homes and recruited as child soldiers; even more farmers will be shot dead in their fields; there will be even more killing in general. In the meanwhile, this people has become so weary.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a delegation there. Will we now take genuine action there, and also harness our efforts to bring about a return to peace? Or will we continue to give aid with one hand and supply weapons with the other, whilst closing our eyes to the fact that the government is, of course, using that money to pay for those weapons? I wonder what kind of hypocritical game we are playing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as we know, no consensus has been reached on a lasting solution and we believe that the role of the political parties and civil society must be better integrated into the peace process; otherwise, there can be no serious chance of restoring confidence. This would appear to be a necessary precondition for any popular foundation for peace negotiations and we are willing to support the request for a round table bringing together a broad spectrum of representatives of the parties and civil society that would make it possible to move forward in the search for a solution to this crisis. However, at this stage we do not believe that any additional measures, such as direct mediation in the peace process, are appropriate while they are not based on a broad consensus between the various parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In your comments, you mentioned the situation of the refugees: we estimate that there are around 100 000 refugees and we regret that the progress made in verifying them has been slow. In order to assist their repatriation and settlement, we are going to continue to supply provisions for the camps and to support the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you highlighted the need to provide our office in Kathmandu with additional resources and we are willing to do this within the limits, of course, of our budget resources, which to a large extent are determined by this House, as you will be aware.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the question of arms sales, it is clear to us that there is no hope of an armed or military solution to this conflict. We will continue to be particularly vigilant with regard to the issue of respect for the Code of Conduct for Arms Exports, which, as you know, implies specific obligations, which also extend to our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, we are being called on to support an absurd control system in which the controller and the controlled are one and the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because the short-term action plan and, more importantly, the creation of a Joint Inspection and Control Structure are measures for the further integration of the ΕU in the fisheries sector, meaning greater restrictions on national fisheries policies and national measures which take account of national peculiarities and requirements.

However, we do not trust either the European institutions or the states themselves to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes this translates into weak-willed measures, and one report confirms that these have been scuppered by various Member States of the European Union, resulting in the continual dramatic decline of the stocks of some fish species. Other times, it results in measures presented as being essential to save nature, while the main, if not the only, effect they have is to persecute the people, in this case those for whom fishing is their livelihood. We should remember that this takes place without any of the big guns having anything to fear.

Such definitions are all the more important given that, until now, the accepted principle has been that the Member States are responsible for monitoring fisheries activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the far-reaching legal implications of the Commission’s proposals – remember that surveillance and monitoring of aspects of the common fisheries policy are in some cases ensured by military means as well – and their very high costs, the rapporteur’s suggestion that a feasibility study be carried out in relation to this proposal, in coordination with the Member States, is equally sensible.

Up to now, scientists’ warnings have fallen on deaf ears at the December annual meetings of the 15 Fisheries Ministers. As a result, we are threatened with the same situation as happened ten years ago off the coast of Canada (Newfoundland). Those waters were fished down to the very last cod, and, even ten years later, there are still no cod to be found. The fishing communities in eastern Canada did not survive that.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has been trying for years to reduce the fleet capacity of European fishermen. That reduction has <span class="italic">not</span> taken place in practice, however. Europe’s overfishing problems are being shifted on to the rest of the world in that increasing numbers of European fishermen are depleting fish stocks in the waters of other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">It all began in Ireland a couple of years ago, when a supertrawler, the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span>, had to be decommissioned. Instead, this supertrawler is now sailing under the Panamanian flag for exactly the same Irish firm in the waters of the Developing World.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now as many as three supertrawlers that have not been decommissioned by the Netherlands; these vessels are now depleting fish stocks in the waters off the West African coast, under the Dutch flag. Thousands of small-scale African fishermen are missing out, and shortly yields off the West African coast will also decrease. The response of the Dutch Government will then probably be to send these supertrawlers even further away. Scientists’ warnings of worldwide overfishing are not being taken seriously: not by the Dutch Government and not by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg (September 2002), the Dutch and European authorities hypocritically signed declarations that there must be an end to worldwide overfishing by 2010, but in reality the Dutch and European authorities are shifting the problems caused by overfishing in European waters on to the countries of the Developing World.</p>

<p>As to the specific point regarding President Arafat, the Council has urged the Israeli Government to refrain from executing its decision in principle to remove the elected President of the Palestinian Authority, which would be counter-productive to the efforts at reaching a peaceful solution to the conflict. The EU will remain in contact with all Israeli Government and Palestinian Authority interlocutors.</p>
<p>While recognising Israel’s legitimate right to self-defence in the face of terrorist attacks against its citizens, the Council also urged the Government of Israel to exert maximum effort to avoid civilian casualties, to put a halt to the practice of extra-judicial killings which are contrary to International Law, to reverse the settlement policy and activity, to dismantle settlements built after March 2001 and to freeze the construction of the separation fence, which results in confiscation of Palestinian land, restricts movement of people and goods and hinders a just political solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The Council also made clear that there is no alternative to a swift and full implementation, in good faith by the two sides, of the roadmap.

<p>(IT) The Council agrees with the Honourable Member that trafficking in human beings is an important issue. It is also a complex issue. It needs to be addressed both at national and at international level. And it needs to be dealt within a broader context, which goes beyond criminal law and also involves asylum and immigration policies and preventive measures.</p>
<p>With regard to the assistance of victims of trafficking in human beings, it is recalled that the Council bodies are currently considering a proposal for a Directive submitted by the Commission. Its objective is to offer to the victims who show their willingness to co-operate and effectively co-operate with the authorities in the proceedings initiated against the traffickers, a certain number of benefits, and in particular the possibility to remain legally in the territory of the Member States for the entire duration of the relevant proceedings. Such treatment is intended to help the victims to recover and to escape from the influence of the traffickers. As it clearly appears, the approach adopted by this instrument offers a two-fold advantage: for the Member States, in their fight against the traffickers and for the victims, who may be granted a legal status under certain conditions and for a period linked with the duration of the proceedings.</p>
<p>As far as criminal law is concerned, the EU has in particular adopted the Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. On the basis of this instrument Member States must provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties regarding trafficking in human beings for the purpose of labour exploitation or sexual exploitation. For defined aggravating circumstances, the maximum penalty provided by Member States must be of at least 8 years imprisonment. The instrument also contains provisions on liability of legal persons and on jurisdiction and prosecution. It must be implemented by Member States at the latest by 1 August 2004.</p>
<p>The Council has also adopted measures on trafficking in human beings, namely the Directive of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence and the Framework Decision of the same date on the strengthening of the penal framework in that regard. These measures must be put in place by the Member States at the latest by 5 December 2004.</p>
<p>A number of more general criminal law measures taken will also contribute to the fight against trafficking in human beings. Examples are the European arrest warrant, Eurojust, the EU Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the European Judicial Network.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0576"></a>

<p>Given that Hagia Sophia has been classed as a world heritage site since 1985 and Turkey's latest national programme to implement the acquis communautaire states that universal cultural goods are protected under Law 3386 of 17 June 1987 so that they can be handed down to future generations in perfect condition, will the Council take up a clear position on this matter?</p>
<p>Does the Council believe that Turkey's action in this regard constitutes a step in the wrong direction in implementing the acquis communautaire in the field of culture and international commitments? Does it consider it appropriate to take joint action with UNESCO in order to tackle this situation, and in particular to prevent similar problems from arising in the country concerned? How will it respond vis-à-vis the Turkish Government?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(IT) The Council shares the concern about the state of the cultural treasures mentioned by the Honourable Member, which form part of the world heritage. The Council recalls to the Honourable Member that in a resolution adopted on 6 May 2003, the Council confirmed that a basic principle ruling the EU, as a community of cultural values and sensitivities, is the respect and protection of world cultural heritage. It also recalls that in another resolution on horizontal aspects of culture, adopted on the same day, the Council stressed that an extra effort is needed to be made to include culture in other sectors with the aim of placing culture at the heart of European integration.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed this specific issue and has no indication of the extent of the damage and resources needed to support conservation and protection of these pieces of art or on the way the Turkish authorities are taking the matter into consideration. However, the Council recalls that the accession partnership includes a reference indicating that membership of the European Union requires inter alia compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. These aims therefore include the community of cultural values. Furthermore, the Council recalls that incorporation of the ‘acquis communautaire’ into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient as it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0582"></a>

<p>(IT) The Council would point out that the location of the seats of the EU institutions is covered by a Protocol annexed to the Treaties.</p>
<p>The Council makes every effort to take account of the European Parliament's wishes. It is, however, inevitable, given their respective activities, that the EU institutions conduct their business simultaneously in the appropriate seats, as laid down by the Treaties.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member points out, it is extremely important to inform the public better about the European Union. The various institutions' activities directed at the press contribute to pluralism of information. The Council, like the other institutions, has a duty to provide the public and the press with information and explanations, a duty to which it attaches the utmost importance.</p>
<p>The 'press and information' aspects cannot be seen as separate from these activities, given that these are political in nature. One or more Presidency press conferences and national media briefings are therefore held on the occasion of each Council meeting, whatever the date on which it is held. To ensure that information on the Council's business and decisions is as rapid and exhaustive as possible, such press conferences must be held as soon as possible and as close as possible to the Council meeting.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council has noted the European Parliament's agreement on the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement on 'Better Lawmaking', which provides for the three institutions to hold a joint press conference whenever negotiations reach a successful conclusion under the codecision procedure, irrespective of whether this occurs at first or second reading or even as the successful outcome of conciliation.</p>
<p>The Council will abide by this undertaking as soon as the interinstitutional agreement is signed and enters into force. In the meantime, it has asked the competent services to make whatever arrangements are necessary for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0584"></a>

<p>The EU has repeatedly stated that the NPT is a cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. In its statement at the Second Preparatory Committee of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT (Geneva, 28 April-9 May 2003), the EU recalled the special importance it attaches to achieving universal adherence to the NPT in order to reinforce the global non-proliferation and disarmament objectives, which are at the core of the Union's policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0597"></a>

<p>(IT) According to the report of the Commission on the practical experience gained with one year of circulation of Euro banknotes and coins (doc. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0747">COM (2002) 747</a> final), counterfeiting of Euro notes and coins has, since their introduction as from 1.1.2002, taken place at a much smaller scale than what was previously experienced with national banknotes and coins.</p>
<p>This being recalled, the Council has provided, in regulation 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, a comprehensive framework for co-operation between the relevant actors, namely competent national authorities, credit institutions, the national central banks and the European Central Bank, in order to ensure effective protection of the euro against counterfeiting. This regulation 1338/2001 provides furthermore, in its article 9, for close co-operation on this issue with non Member countries and relevant international organisations. By regulation 1339/2001, this legal framework has been extended to non euro Member States.</p>
<p>In the field of criminal law, the Council has in particular on 29 May 2000 adopted the Framework Decision on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. This instrument provides that counterfeiting of money, and a number of acts related to that, such as fraudulent uttering of counterfeit money, transporting, receiving and obtaining counterfeit money and fraudulent acts concerning instruments peculiarly adapted for counterfeiting, must be punishable in a way that makes extradition possible. The key offence, counterfeiting of money, must be punishable with a maximum penalty of at least 8 years of imprisonment. All EU Member States which have adopted the euro, must have jurisdiction regarding counterfeiting of the euro, independently of the nationality of the offender and the place where the offence has been committed. The deadline for implementation of the instrument by the Member States was 29 May 2001. A first implementation report has been established, and a second is being elaborated. It may be concluded that, in general, the instrument has been implemented in a satisfactory way by Member States.</p>
<p>The Council has in addition in Decision of 6 December 2001 (2001/887/JAI) on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting laid down measures in respect of expert analysis of notes and coins and exchange of results of analyses and other relevant information. The necessary steps have also been taken to ensure the competence of Europol in respect of counterfeiting, and for the purpose of establishing agreements between Europol and Interpol and other parties in this field.</p>
<p>The instruments referred to are part of the acquis that the incoming Member states must have implemented by the date of accession.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Council adopted on 2 October 2003 a Council recommendation on measures to protect the euro against counterfeiting.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0608"></a>

<p>(EN) There exists a range of civil protection measures, which include EU and national instruments covering the following possible actions on civil protection following terrorist attacks using biological or chemical weapons:</p>
<p>CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) Action Programme: under the mandate of the European Council of Ghent, the Council and the Commission adopted, on 20 December 2002, a programme to improve co-operation in the European Union for preventing and limiting the consequences of CBRN terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Within the general field of Civil Protection, a Community Mechanism to facilitate reinforced co-operation in civil protection assistance has been established by a Council decision of 23 October 2001.</p>
<p>The Health Security Committee (HSC) has been set up on 26 October 2001. The HSC is comprised of high-level representatives of the Member States charged with raising the alert, exchanging information rapidly and co-ordinating health responses in case of emergency following a deliberate release of biological or chemical agents to cause harm.</p>
<p>Other EC instruments exist in the areas of animal protection, atomic questions, energy, environment protection, transport, telecommunications, food protection, plant safety and research.</p>
<p>Military forces have developed inherent capabilities and specialised units to perform their military tasks to deal with CBRN threats. These assets are focused primarily on force protection. Nevertheless, such capabilities and units may be used, on a case-by-case basis, to support civil protection against CBRN terrorism. Obviously, the military assets and capabilities of Member States can be called upon by the competent authorities of that State, to perform tasks in the protection of their civil population. The use of those assets and capabilities might be provided on a bilateral basis or in the framework of a co-ordinated approach within the Council or through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism pursuant to the national legislation of the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>Finally the Council would recall that this is an area which has become a major focus of attention recently and there are improvements to be made.

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is well aware, one of the priorities of the European Union is to ensure that the Lisbon objective of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 is achieved. The role that SMEs play is of crucial importance for meeting this goal. The report on the first year's activities of the SME Envoy designated by the Commission in 2001 underlines the importance that this role could play at the Community level in helping to achieve this objective.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will appreciate that the provisions of Article 157 of the Treaty are relatively limited in nature and that it does not fall within the competence of the Community to take decisions on what measures individual Member States should take, such as the designation of SME envoys. However a good deal of the work undertaken in ensuring industrial competitiveness covers coordination and in particular the open method of coordination under which the exchange of good practices between Member States is an important element. This leads to a system of mutual learning and comparison of result.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council has on several occasions adopted conclusions or resolutions where the importance of fostering entrepreneurship and creating favourable conditions for the establishment, continued operation and growth of SMEs has been stressed. These in addition underline the importance of establishing efficient lines of communication between the SMEs and national authorities and the need to reduce to a minimum burdensome bureaucratic procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0599"></a>

<p>(EN) The SARS outbreak showed how quickly new diseases are able to emerge and spread and how a well co-ordinated response can stop the situation from degenerating into a crisis.</p>
<p>Strengthening the networks of preparedness and response to such diseases is a top priority. Health Ministers agreed at the Extraordinary Health Council of 6 May 2003 to bring together expertise to mount an effective response to SARS. An expert group on SARS was subsequently established.</p>
<p>Co-ordination of surveillance and response are key elements for the early detection of SARS cases and for stopping the potential spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken a leading role in this in the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission informs the Member States, the Acceding and EEA/EFTA Countries on a routine basis on developments concerning SARS. In case of emergency, the Commission will inform these countries through its Early Warning and Response System.</p>
<p>This system was used successfully during the last SARS incident in Singapore.</p>
<p>On that occasion the Commission asked the SARS experts’ group to provide comments on the event and an opinion on its follow-up. The replies indicated that there was no need for urgent action, although the developments should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the Panel of experts of the Singapore Ministry of Health, inappropriate laboratory procedures led to the infection.</p>
<p>The Union has now a strong system in place to monitor and to co-ordinate the response to the SARS virus.</p>
<p>In response to the SARS outbreak the Commission organized a special call for research proposals within the context of Sixth Union Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6 2003-2006). EUR 9 million will be made available to fund new research to help tackle SARS. The special call which closed on 30 September 2003, covers amongst others, surveillance and control, clinical manifestations including disease transmission, infection control procedures, interventions and vaccines, and risk assessment.</p>
<p>If SARS returns, the intensive surveillance approach will be applied again and the recommended measures that have been proved to work to control the outbreak, that is case detection, patients isolation and infection control, and contact tracing will be restored.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for the opportunity to speak on the important issue of smoking in the workplace. The question is very broad, and there is no time here to give a really comprehensive response.</p>
<p>However, the implications for the Union as a whole in public health and economic terms of active and passive smoking in the workplace can be at least briefly outlined in the present answer.</p>
<p>From a public health perspective, half a million people die in the Community each year from the effects of tobacco consumption. This mortality rate is predicted to keep rising, so that smoking will continue to be the biggest single form of avoidable death in Europe.</p>
<p>This affects not just active smokers. Studies have repeatedly shown that if someone is regularly exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, through passive smoking, he will have a higher risk of the diseases that it causes. International studies have shown that exposure to tobacco smoke can cause lung cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>Smoking in the workplace therefore becomes a major risk factor for the health of employees. A review of evidence<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in Ireland last year found that people who don’t smoke, but who work in a smoking environment, have an increased risk of lung cancer of between 20% - 30%. The risk of heart disease also increased by about the same amount.</p>
<p>There has always been a strong dose-response effect in relation to tobacco. That is to say, the more someone is exposed to it – the higher his risk of developing serious illness. It stands to reason therefore that people who work in very smoky environments such as bars and restaurants are at a particularly high risk of developing cancers and heart disease.</p>
<p>These businesses employ thousands of people in Europe. The Commission believes that they too have a right to be protected from cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that an estimated 20% of the European population who suffer from asthma and other respiratory illness. Like all non-smokers, people with these conditions suffer from tobacco smoke and have their long-term health put at risk. But, moreover, smoky rooms trigger or worsen their day-to-day symptoms.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, it is important to remember that almost half of smoking related deaths occur in people aged between 35 and 69 years of age. This is at a time when people are particularly productive from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>The loss of productivity and consequently income can affect not only businesses but also households and individuals. The prevalence of cigarette smoking is strongly associated with social class, meaning that the poorest families are most affected by the ill health and loss of income that it causes.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view restricting smoking in the workplace is an important part of the jigsaw to control tobacco use in the population. Not only are non-smokers protected, but such initiatives may help smokers who are trying to give up. However it is important that workplace based actions are seen in the context of a broader tobacco control policy that includes regulation, taxation policy and smoking advice from health professionals.</p>
<p>As far as legislative action is concerned, the relevant Commission Services are examining the issue to determine any eventual European input into this process. However, in developing this debate, it is important to consider the central role which national and local regulators have to play in identifying suitable measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member has referred to recent statements made by the Member of the Commission in charge of Health and Consumer Protection concerning GM authorisations and in particular the approval of BT11 sweet maize.</p>
<p>It is correct that product applications are moving through the approval procedures as foreseen in Community legislation. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>The authorisation procedure provides that a GM product has to be scientifically assessed for its risks to health and environment prior to its placing on the market.</p>
<p>If concluded to be safe and if the product fulfils all the necessary requirements in Community legislation, it can be placed on the market.</p>
<p>One of the product applications which has now reached that stage is the BT11 sweet maize. This GM maize is for approval for food use under the Novel Food Regulation.</p>
<p>BT11 has received a favourable opinion from the Scientific Committee on Food and since then the Commission has been in contact with the companies to establish the appropriate conditions for authorisation.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission in charge of Health and Consumer Protection understands that we now have a validated a detection method for BT11 and therefore believes that we are ready to move forward and authorise the product in accordance with the Novel Food Regulation.</p>
<p>Applications are also moving through the procedure under Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment - for which the Member of the Commission in charge of Environment is responsible.</p>
<p>By proceeding with authorisations for products that have been concluded to be safe for health and the environment, the Commission is applying European legislation as agreed by the Council and the Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0581"></a>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is aware, in July 2003 the Commission adopted its proposal for a Directive concerning reduced rates of VAT. The primary objectives of this proposal were both to allow all Member States an equal opportunity to apply reduced rates, and to rationalise and simplify the complex web of current derogations. The expected outcome is a considerable improvement in the functioning of the internal market and a reduction in market distortions, something which has given rise to numerous complaints from traders.</p>
<p>It is essential that the Union ensures a more equitable treatment of all Member States, both old and new. The derogations granted to the United Kingdom, and other Member States, were, from the first, only intended to be transitional measures. It is now time for a certain degree of rationalisation, particularly in light of the agreements with new Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has examined the VAT treatment of motorcycle helmets throughout Europe. Only the United Kingdom applies a non-standard VAT rate to these products. Since 14 Member States apply a standard rate of VAT, which can vary between 15 and 25 percent, the Commission did not include a reduced rate for motorcycle helmets in its proposal.</p>
<p>As regards the effect of a reduced VAT rate on the safety of motorcyclists, any such effect is necessarily limited. A Directive of 1989 makes the EC mark compulsory for all products with specific protective features, ensuring a high level of safety protection for users. Moreover, this mark contributes to market transparency, as products that conform to the Directive can be visibly distinguished. Nevertheless, the price of such products differs considerably, even though the level of protection is the same. Consequently, the VAT rate applied has only a marginal influence on the final product price.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission has proposed to confine the scope of zero rates to those goods and services listed in the new Annex H, to rationalise and simplify the current structure of rates. Since motorcycle helmets have never been subject to reduced rates, the United Kingdom's derogation, only ever meant to be temporary, should now disappear.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the light of the principle of the free movement of goods I should like to raise the following matter. A French armourer from Alsace, who also deals in hunting weapons, chiefly those made in Germany, is facing serious problems in carrying on his business. He can no longer simply pick up weapons produced in Germany, where most European hunting weapons are manufactured, from customs in Alsace. Instead, he must first obtain an import licence from the centralised customs authority recently set up in Paris. However, such licences are very difficult to obtain, must be issued before the transaction in question is completed, are valid only for six months and are made available only on completion of a lengthy procedure. Moreover, he cannot import weapons owned by private individuals from Germany, given the impossibility of providing the relevant tax numbers or other details in advance.</p>

<p>(EN) The circulation of civil firearms is, at the Community level, regulated by the Council Directive of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons (91/477/EEC).</p>
<p>Following the provisions of this Directive, any commercial transfer of civil weapons is submitted to prior authorization by Member States involved in this transfer. The Commission has, of course, no authority to impose on any Member State the choice of the authority (central or local) competent to grant this type of authorization.</p>
<p>When the transfer is operated between private persons, or between a qualified dealer and a private person, the procedure above mentioned is applicable. It implies that a certain amount of information must be given in order to obtain, within a reasonable delay, the authorization.</p>

<p>In case of transfers involving only qualified dealers, no prior authorization might be required.</p>
<p>Should a fiscal identification number be required for the granting of the authorization, this requirement would not be regarded as contradictory to the Directive, as its Article 3 allows Member States to adopt in their legislation provisions more stringent than those provided for in the said Directive.

This project, which had already been proposed by the Commission in 2001<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and received the support of Parliament, includes all of the high-speed links between Galicia and the rest of Spain, as well as Portugal, on the basis of Spanish and Portuguese national plans.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission supports the media of regional and minority language communities through several actions.</p>
<p>The Commission finances the Mercator network whose main role is the collection, storage, analysis and circulation of information via an information and documentation network intended for the Union’s regional and minority languages. The Mercator Media centre covers the following areas: press, publication of books, archives and libraries, as well as television, radio and new media.</p>
<p>The European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages – a body that is 80% financed by the Commission – also recognises the media as important and thus finances the implementation and running of a press agency EUROLANG (http://www.eurolang.net). Created in 2000, this agency deals with all medias and broadcasts news and information about linguistic diversity in Europe. It covers events of general interest for the language communities concerned as well as information at European level.</p>
<p>The Bureau also created the portal Lingualia (http://www.lingualia.net/) in collaboration with the Mercator network. This European portal for regional and minority languages in Europe, aims to be a quality Internet service for all regional and minority language communities. Part of the information relates to minorities in the candidate and accession countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the context of enlargement, the Commission has just launched an extension to the Euromosaic study (http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/). This study will enable us to have a thorough knowledge of the situation regarding regional and minority languages in the candidate countries, in particular of their presence in the media.</p>
<p>Finally the Media programme makes financing audiovisual works possible. Nine candidate countries already have the opportunity of receiving funding from this programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0523"></a>

<p>Parliament has noted year after year, in its reports on human rights in the EU, the dramatic and disturbing state of affairs in the Union's prisons. It has repeatedly called on the Council and Commission to take action to define certain minimum standards with regard to respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of prisoners in the Union. The President-in-Office of the Justice and Internal Affairs Council, Mr Roberto Castelli, has announced on behalf of the Italian presidency, at hearings held by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that an inquiry is to be carried out into the execution of sentences and prison systems. Mr Castelli stated in an article published on 7 August 2003 in the 'Corriere della Sera' that he had 'launched an initiative for the definition of thresholds of acceptable conditions in the EU's prisons'.</p>

<p>(EN) In its Programme for 1 July – 31 December 2003, the Italian Presidency had stated that it would take an ‘initiative’ for monitoring prison conditions throughout the Union with a view to drawing up new forms of treatment of offenders in order to improve crime prevention. However, no initiative pursuant to Article 34 of the Treaty on the European Union has been made by the Presidency on this subject.</p>
<p>The three questions by the Honourable Member are interlinked and cannot be answered separately.</p>
<p>The treatment of prisoners and pre-trial detainees is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Commission does support the Italian Presidency’s view that better information on the prison population is essential background to the development of mutual recognition and enforcement of custodial and non-custodial measures throughout the Union.</p>
<p>At the request of the Italian Presidency, the Commission has drawn up a questionnaire on statistical data on the prison population, including pre-trial detention, in the Member States and in the accession countries. The questionnaire was sent to the Member States and the accession countries before the summer, but the Commission has still not received all the replies.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to include a short analysis of the replies in the two Green Papers that are currently being prepared in this area: 1) the Green Paper on the approximation, mutual recognition and enforcement of criminal sanctions in the Union, and 2) the Green Paper on mutual recognition and enforcement of non-custodial supervision measures and pre-trial detention. The Green Papers will also consider the question of the legal basis for taking any eventual action in this area.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the Treaty on the European Union obliges the Union to respect fundamental rights but does not provide a suitable legal basis for a Union legislative instrument.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that any consideration of a possible framework decision on minimum standards in this area would depend on the outcome of the consultation planned on the basis of the Green Papers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>However, the Directive states as a general principle that only cosmetic products that do not cause damage to human health can be put on the market (Article 2 of the Directive).</p>
<p>Therefore, cosmetic products must only contain safe ingredients. Regarding an adequate safety assessment of cosmetic products, there is an obligation for the manufacturer to keep information on its cosmetic products readily accessible for the control authorities of the Member States (Article 7a of the Directive).</p>
<p>The overall issue of substances used in artificial fingernail systems has already been discussed in different meetings of the Cosmetics Working Group with Member States and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Commission asked Member States and the industry to present scientific data for the safety evaluation of these substances by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for the Consumer (SCCPNF).</p>
<p>Based on data submitted by the industry a safety evaluation of three substances was initiated. These substances (hydroquinone, benzoyl peroxide and hydroquinone methylether) are now subject to restrictions and conditions laid down in Annex III of the Cosmetics Directive following the recent adoption of Commission Directive of 24 September 2003<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>So far, no data has been submitted by a Member State for risk assessment by the Scientific Committee of any substance of the group of acrylates, nor has any information been received regarding the application of the safeguard clause by any Member State.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commission has requested the industry to provide information and scientific data on a possible risk associated with the use of methyl methacrylate in cosmetic products with a view to consulting the Scientific Committee for a safety assessment.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, more than 320 corpses of women and girls have been found in Ciudad Juárez in Mexico. A total of 4 476 women and girls, average age between 14 and 16, have disappeared in Mexican cities. The ineffectiveness of the Mexican authorities' investigations means that these women, who are suffering the gravest possible violation of their fundamental rights, are without protection. Moreover, the Mexican authorities fail to comply with the recommendations and action plan of the UN IVth World Women's Conference or the commitments they have undertaken in the United Nation Convention for eliminating all forms of discrimination against women.</p>
<p>Given the seriousness of the facts, and the enormous number of victims, is the Commission thinking about devoting some of the funds for cooperation with Mexico to helping the victims and their families, e.g. by setting-up a full-scale programme for this purpose?</p>

<p>(EN) Mexico is a priority country for the European Initiative on Democratisation and Human Rights (EIDHR). The consolidation of the rule of law, with the aim of promoting respect for human rights, is a focal sector in the 2002-2006 Country Strategy Paper. In total, some EUR 6 million has been made available to fund human rights related projects in Mexico in the period 2002-2006. The Commission’s approach is based on (a) funding projects to improve performance of Mexican authorities in human rights field, and (b) inclusion of human rights issues in political dialogue with Mexico. A programme specifically for the victims of the Ciudad Juárez murders is not foreseen as part of this approach.</p>
<p>The Commission is contributing EUR 3.5 million to a project that seeks to strengthen and modernise the Mexican justice system at state and federal level. The project focuses on improving the administration of justice through support to local public prosecutors and other key actors. Although not directly aimed at the Ciudad Juárez cases, this project will increase the quality of judicial investigations in Mexico.</p>
<p>In keeping with Commission policy on development cooperation, all projects are designed with full consideration of gender as an important cross-cutting issue. Additionally the Commission is financing some projects that focus specifically on women: for example, a new project that will use radio to support a nationwide women’s network on human rights (EUR 550.000).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0534"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the case mentioned by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>Over the last year, as part of the political reforms in view of complying with the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey has introduced an amendment to the Cinema, Video and Music Works Law. The scope for suspending or banning artistic works has been narrowed to cover only those offences considered to undermine the fundamental characteristics of the Republic and the indivisible integrity of the State. In addition, any administrative decision to suspend artistic works must now be confirmed by a judge within 24 hours. A further revision to this law states that a National Security Council representative will no longer be entitled to a place on the Board of Supervision.</p>
<p>The Commission expects the Turkish government to implement these new provisions promptly to make sure that artistic works including films can be made available to the Turkish public within the limits of the relevant European standards.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring closely the implementation of these new provisions and will make an assessment in its Regular Report on Turkey to be published on 5 November 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0536"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission, and the Member of the Commission in charge of the Budget in particular, take this issue very seriously. This issue shows how important the work of OLAF is. Together with the Vice President, the Commissioner responsible for the budget recently initiated an exercise to obtain assurances from all services that certain practices alleged to have operated in Eurostat have not been used since the present Commission has been in office. Regarding the steps already taken and those planned, as was outlined in President Prodi's speech on 25 September to the Conference of Presidents, this matter has been the subject of investigations by OLAF and the Internal Auditor of the Commission and of a report of a Special Task Force, and, finally, a detailed examination by DG Budget of the conformity of the acts described in the Eurostat audits with the Financial Regulation. Following the discharge resolution on Budget 2001 and at the request of the Parliament, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) was mandated by the Commission to examine the legality and the regularity of a sample of contracts concluded by Eurostat since 1999 and to include in its investigation contracts concluded by other Commission services, with Eurostat involvement. The Parliament will be informed by the end of October 2003. On 9 July, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against three senior officials in Eurostat and further ones will be made should they be justified by the discovery of new facts. The organisation of Eurostat will be thoroughly overhauled. A new Director General has been installed and a new organisation chart adopted. Regarding the contracts involved, the Commission has decided to cancel those with organisations and companies likely to be implicated in this case. The true extent of the amounts involved still needs to be assessed.</p>
<p>A number of fundamental measures have already been introduced under the Reform to strengthen control and accountability. In particular the Commission wants to mention: moving to de-centralised ex-ante controls, introducing new financial circuits, setting internal control standards and a new Financial Regulation. In addition, DGs are required to report annually on their activities and to make a declaration on the use of resources and on the legality and regularity of transactions. Furthermore, the Commission, as announced by President Prodi, will seek to consolidate the Reform in the areas of the relations between Commissioners, cabinets and departments and between the central administration and outlying departments in the area of control and audit. Measures have already been taken in this regard in requiring Directors General to report at least twice yearly to Commissioners on audit and internal control related issues and they cover also the exchange of information with OLAF. President Prodi committed himself to present to the Parliament an action plan in November in order to remedy to shortcomings identified through the Eurostat affair.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0543"></a>

<p>During the period June 2001 - December 2002 the European Union disbursed EUR 10 m per month in direct budgetary support totalling USD 228 m to the PNA to 'mitigate the effects of the freeze of revenue transfers by the Government of Israel' (Commissioner Patten, <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2003-1437_EN.html">P-1437/03</a>, 27 May 2003). Following the payment in August 2002 of a first instalment of the arrears, in December of that year the Israeli Government resumed the regular revenue transfers and in July 2003 completed the payment of arrears, amounting to a total of USD 900 m. The fact that Israel has paid all the arrears means that the emergency situation regarding the PNA budget no longer exists and that there is now a surplus of USD 228 m (the amount disbursed by the EU, which has now also been repaid by Israel). What will happen now that Israel has paid the USD 900 owed to the PNA? Will the PNA return the USD 228 m to the EU, or has some other political decision been taken? If it has, which institution took the decision, and when? What arrangements have been made to monitor the use of the USD 228 m, if that sum is to remain in the hands of the PNA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) From October 2000 to August 2003, the amount of tax revenues transfers due by Israel to the Palestinian Authority amounted to US$1,032 million. During that period, Israel has paid US$594 million. This implies that a residual stock of payments of US$ 438 million remains. During the period under consideration Union direct budget support amounted to US$ 232 million, that is just over 50% of the residual stock. These figures show that a surplus does not exist.</p>
<p>In the mean time the budget of the Palestinian authority remains under strong pressure. This is also confirmed by World Bank estimates according to which the Palestinian Authority continues to face a budget deficit of US$27 million per month in the first half of 2003, despite having made significant cuts in expenditure.</p>
<p>Regarding the arrangements that have been made to monitor the use of the Commission contribution, it should be recalled that the Commission contribution is conditional upon concrete reforms in the financial management of the Palestinian Authority. Moreover, the Commission contribution has been implemented in close association with the IMF which has monitored, on a regular basis, the evolution of public finance of the Palestinian Authority.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0551"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission investigation that opened on 11 December 2002, in accordance with Treaty requirements, is intended to determine whether the advantages that the Region of Wallonia and the airport operator (BSCA) conferred on Ryanair when it moved into Charleroi in April 2001 (rebates on landing fees, defraying Ryanair staff costs, defraying marketing costs, financial incentives each time a new route is opened, etc.) are equivalent or not to state aid and, if they are, whether these advantages are compatible with the common market or whether on the other hand they constitute distortions of competition to the disadvantage of other operators, whether these are other airlines or other airports.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing the final decision in this case, having received numerous comments from interested parties, from Ryanair and from the Belgian authorities.</p>
<p>The aid to Air France, which was approved by the Commission in 1994, is aid for restructuration of an undertaking. The Commission scrutinises this aid in the light of guidelines on restructuration aid, and in this case the criteria for approval were met. Several other European companies have obtained this type of state aid and have been subject to the same checks by the Commission. The period at the beginning of the 1990s was marked by the first stages in liberalisation of European skies and the national flag carriers, which until then had been protected on their national markets, have had to undergo substantial adaptation and restructuration. The Community rule on aid being granted only once (one time, last-time) and counterpart measures requested in accordance with the guidelines have made it possible to ensure that the aid has indeed been used to this end and not as operating aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0553"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission is aware of the request made to the French authorities by Electricité de France (EDF) regarding the modification of the discharge limits for liquid radioactive effluents within the framework of the renewal of discharge authorisations for the nuclear power station at Cattenom. It would appear that this modification involves a general reduction of discharge limits for all radionuclides apart from tritium, for which an increase is apparently requested.</p>
<p>If the French authorities intend to grant a new discharge authorisation for the Cattenom nuclear power station involving an increase in the discharge limit for tritium in liquid effluents, they must, in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, communicate to the Commission the general information relating to this modification. In that event, following consultation with the group of experts referred to in Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission will issue, within 6 months, an opinion on the radiological impact of this modification on the population of other Member States.</p>
<p>The granting of authorisations to discharge radioactive effluent falls within the responsibility of the Member States. The practice for setting established limits within discharge authorisations may differ between Member States and depend in particular on the characteristics of installations. These limits conform to the basic standards set at Community level, which are aimed at maintaining a non-significant level of radiological impact. On a regular basis, the Commission publishes assessments of real discharges of radioactive effluents from the Union’s nuclear stations and reprocessing plants. This data is available to the public, on a simple request, from the services of the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0555"></a>

<p>The Franco-Spanish tobacco group ALTADIS announced on 23 July 2003 that it was restructuring in order to match production to demand, a step involving the closure of various plants (Seville, Cadiz, Tarragona, Lille, Tonneins, Morlaix and Dijon) and the loss of 1276 jobs, 743 of them in Spain and 533 in France; the respective numbers of workers affected is actually 977 and 701 if we include transfers. This restructuring process has caused enormous social concern in France and Spain due to the large numbers of job losses involved, which come on top of the cutbacks that the Tabacalera and Seita companies carried out before their merger (the Spanish company shut down eight plants and fired 2100 workers).</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has not been informed of the way in which the Altadis Group intends to deal with the social consequences of the ongoing restructuring of the company.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, would like to recall that, over the years, the Union has developed a comprehensive policy for dealing adequately with the social consequences of corporate restructuring. As a result of that on-going policy, every restructuring operation must be preceded by effective information and consultation of employees' representatives with the aim of avoiding or attenuating its social impact, in accordance with Community Directives on ‘Collective Redundancies’<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, ‘Transfers of Undertakings’<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, ‘European Works Councils’<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and, from March 2005 onwards, ‘Information and Consultation’<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In particular, Directive 98/59/EC concerning collective redundancies provides for information and consultation with the workers' representatives in cases where the employer is contemplating such redundancies. These consultations should be carried out in good time with a view to reaching agreement and cover, at least, ways and means of avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected as well as of mitigating the consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures. These measures aim, inter alia, at aid for redeploying or retraining workers who have been made redundant.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission advocates the idea that, when restructuring, enterprises should always take into account the effects that those decisions could have on their employees as well as on the social and regional context. This has recently been underlined in the Commission Communication concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): A business contribution to Sustainable Development<a href="#defann_46_5" name="refann_46_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission invited the European social partners to engage in a dialogue on anticipating and managing change with a view to applying a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring. The social partners are in the course of concluding an agreement on this. The Commission very much hopes that their joint work in this field will result in a Community framework which disseminates throughout Europe good practices of corporate restructuring, thus helping companies and their workers to adequately address its social dimension.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 3 September 2003 King Sihanouk made an important statement, with particular reference to Montagnard refugees, which included the following remarks: ‘We (Second Kingdom of Cambodia) have a Constitution (1993) which has established a liberal democracy in our country and not a false 'democracy'. And we have signed United Nations human rights conventions. ... We must not return oppressed people asking us for asylum to the countries which they have fled'. The statement confirms the fact that the Cambodian authorities are pursuing their capture and forced repatriation policy, thereby fuelling a fully-fledged black market: Vietnam is paying a ransom of $50 to $100 for each Montagnard who is returned. The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr Leuprecht, has repeatedly stated that such actions are a threat to the lives of deportees. They also constitute a serious violation of the UN Refugee Convention. One of the most recent incidents, concerning four Montagnards, took place on 7 August 2003. When will the Commission finally persuade Phnom Penh to put an end to the ongoing violations of the UN Refugee Convention?

<p>(EN) The Commission’s Delegation in Phnom Penh, together with the Diplomatic Missions of the Member States, continues to follow closely the situation of the Vietnamese Montagnards and other asylum seekers who seek refuge in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The representatives in Cambodia of the Commission and the Member States also remain in close contact with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on this issue. At present there are still more than 80 recognised refugees, most of them Vietnamese, under UNCHR custody in Cambodia awaiting resettlement in the United States.</p>
<p>The Commission has been informed that discussions are on-going between the UNHCR and the Government of Cambodia on the possibility of putting in place a system to deal with asylum seekers in accordance with the UN Convention. These efforts are fully supported by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, at present it is clear that concerns remain regarding the treatment and reception of asylum seekers in Cambodia. Taking into account the closure of the UNHCR camp in Mondolkiri in April 2002 and considering that the UNHCR is still denied free access to the North-eastern border areas, the situation of Montagnards asylum seekers, arriving from Vietnam, is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>The issue of non-refoulement is of particular concern after reports confirming the deportation of four persons by the Cambodian border police in August 2003 as well as two Chinese nationals in 2002. The Commission is also aware of reports regarding alleged ‘rewards’ for Montagnards who are handed over to Vietnamese authorities but so far it has not been able to confirm the accuracy of these reports.</p>
<p>The Commission's approach towards Cambodia in the field of human rights, as it is towards all countries in the region, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns where abuses occur, in the framework of the international human rights instruments.</p>
<p>The Commission, together with Member States, will therefore continue to urge Cambodia to uphold its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol with regard to the prohibition of the refoulement of refugees. It will also encourage the Government of Cambodia to cooperate fully with the UNHCR in order to reach an agreement that will enable Cambodia to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0578"></a>

<p>(FR) Within the framework of the fifth framework research and technological development programme (1998-2002), no project for research on the human embryo has been funded. A very large number of projects involve, however, the use of animal embryos and in particular mouse embryos. The mouse is the most commonly used animal model for medical research.</p>
<p>With regard to Community research on embryonic stem cell lines, to date, 13 projects have been listed as using animal embryonic stem cell lines (more than 80% are embryonic stem cell lines from mice).</p>
<p>A single project has initially been identified at the time of evaluation as intending to use existing human embryonic stem cell lines (QLK3-2002-01777). The latest annual scientific reports received by the Commission reveal, however, the use of existing human embryonic stem cell lines in at least four additional projects. This demonstrates very clearly that the use of these lines by researchers is increasing. This would bring the number of projects using these lines to five. With regard to these four additional projects, an ethical review is going to be carried out within the context of the identification of new elements involved in projects underway and of an ethically sensitive nature. To this end, complementary information on the lines used is going to be requested from the respective coordinators as well as evidence that the national authorisations have been granted.</p>
<p>The total amount of the Community contribution for all these projects is around EUR 23 million. Of this amount, more than EUR 15 million only involve projects using animal lines, around EUR 6 million involve projects using both animal and human lines, and around EUR 2 million only involve projects using one or more human lines. On this point, it is important to note that, in fact, just a fraction of this sum, which is perhaps very variable depending on the project (and is sometimes very small), directly involves research on, or with, these lines, whether animal or human.</p>

<p>On Thursday 18 September 2003, a serious accident happened in Hérault, in the South of France. A lorry carrying a load of 12 000 litres of thioglycollic acid, produced by Atofina, overturned and fell into the Illouvre river where it runs alongside a winding stretch of RN (national road) 112 between St Pons de Thomières and St Chinian. The driver was seriously injured, and the vats split open, releasing the acid which, as well as polluting the river and surrounding environment, also caused 50 fire-fighters and 17 gendarmes to be hospitalised suffering from headaches, respiratory disturbances, itching and rashes. A deplorable aspect of this accident is that staff of the DDE (Departmental Equipment Directorate), present at the scene, did not have the same 'precautionary principle' applied to them. The load in question was, moreover, being transported between Mourenx, in the Pyrénées Atlantiques department near the Atlantic coast, and the Mediterranean port of Sète, along a section of road where 8 fatalities were recorded between 1995 and 2001, with yet others having occurred since, and where a number of lorries have shed their loads.</p>

<p>(FR) At the moment, the transport of dangerous goods by road is subject to strict and detailed regulations, both at international level by means of the international agreement concerning the carriage of dangerous goods by road ‘ADR agreement’ of the United Nations Economic Committee for Europe, at European level by means of Directive 94/55/EC<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and at national level for transport carried out within the territory of a single Member State. According to the said legislation, thioglycollic acid is a product the transport of which by road is allowed under the conditions of the ADR agreement (this product being UN No 1940).</p>
<p>Article 5(1) Directive 94/55/EC lays down the possibility for each Member State to regulate or prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within its territory, for reasons of environmental protection, amongst others. Paragraph 4 of the same article allows a Member State to propose safety measures to the Community committee on the transport of dangerous goods, following an accident for example.</p>
<p>The intervention plans in the event of accidents involving vehicles transporting dangerous goods are laid down by the Member States. To this end, manufacturers of these products provide them with information intended to allow emergency services to intervene effectively, under the best safety conditions, by means, in particular, of the European ‘ERICards’<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> service, which is accessible via the Internet in several languages.</p>
<p>In its White Paper on European transport policy<a href="#defann_50_3" name="refann_50_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Commission presented a series of measures intended to reduce the current imbalance in transport.

<p>(EN) The HIV/AIDS is the worst pandemic the world has ever faced. The European Commission is aware of the importance of this disease. For this reason, HIV/AIDS is a research priority under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and the budget devoted to this disease has been increased fourfold with respect to the previous Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Resistance to anti-HIV/AIDS drugs is a growing problem in the developed world. Under the Fifth Framework programme, the Commission has funded several research projects on HIV-drug resistance, including both basic aspects and epidemiological studies, with a budget over EUR 8 million. One of these projects (SPREAD, Strategy to Control Spread of HIV Drug Resistance, co-ordinated by Prof. Charles Boucher, NL) has recently published that the rate of HIV drug resistance in Europe is close to 10%. This project will continue to be funded by the Commission until December 2005. Other projects, like EuroSIDA (Clinical and Virological Outcome of European Patients Infected with HIV), CASCADE (Virological Characterisation of Primary HIV Infection) or PENTA (Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS), in close collaboration with United States’ experts, are following up patients and developing guidelines for their treatment, including drug resistance. Many of these projects are increasing their collaboration with researchers from Eastern Europe, where the HIV epidemic is growing sharply.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently discussing with the Member States and the relevant Advisory Committee the effect of antiretroviral resistance in HIV disease progression, and possible future collaborative activities in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0594"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the study done in the Netherlands. This study focused on relations between exposure to low intensity fields of base stations used for GSM 900, GSM 1800 and UMTS (3<span class="sup">rd</span> generation) networks. An unexpected but small negative correlation between well-being and exposure to UMTS exposure was found. No such correlation was observed for exposure to GSM fields. A positive correlation between cognitive capabilities and exposure to GSM fields, also observed in other studies was confirmed. The study calls for an independent confirmation of its results and an extension of the study method.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently supporting under the 5<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (Quality of Life, Key Action 4: Environment and Health), a mix of studies in different research areas in order to evaluate potential adverse health effect of electromagnetic fields, including mobile communication technologies. This programme includes different types of studies in order to investigate distinct aspects of this issue. The total cost of the projects involved is more than EUR 32 million, with a Community contribution of over EUR 12 million. Included are four projects dealing with the possible carcinogenic effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF), one project on terahertz radiation related to medical imaging applications, and further two projects on possible effects on hearing and on possible biological effects and hazards due to exposure of brain and nerve cells to high frequency electromagnetic fields (GSM 900 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, UMTS). The results of all the above-mentioned studies will be available by end 2005.</p>
<p>In addition, under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, the Commission is at the moment negotiating a contract for a Network of Excellence called EMF-NET aimed at improving the co-ordination of the results of the research activities related to the biological effects of electromagnetic fields. This network should also consider the potential risks related to occupational exposure. The EMF-NET Consortium involves all the co-ordinators of the Union (FP5) funded active projects, and of the main research projects at national level (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, United Kingdom). In addition it involves other international activities, such as the World Health Organisation EMF project and the COST 281 Action, associations of industries and manufactures, regulatory bodies, scientific association, and trade union associations. This network will also monitor emerging and third generation technologies, identifying the main needs in terms of co-ordination and studies. In this context, the study done in the Netherlands will certainly raise attention to the phenomena observed.</p>
<p>The REFLEX project has terminated at the end of August 2003 but the Commission is waiting for the final report of the project, which is due at the end of October. A summary of the final report will be made available to the public.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In order to analyse all the direct and indirect implications of a reform of the current common organisation of the market, both in the production sector and in the sectors and regions dependent on it, the Commission has decided to carry out an in-depth impact study.</p>
<p>Within the context of this study, 14 Directorate-Generals have carried out in-depth analysis work and the issue of employment in tobacco-growing regions has been examined in detail in collaboration, in particular, with the Directorate-General responsible in that field. This issue has also been highlighted by the local elected representatives of the tobacco-producing areas at a forum which brought together representatives of all the interested parties, organised by the Commission within the context of drawing up the in-depth impact study.</p>
<p>The analytical tools available to the Commission, and in particular the FADN, demonstrate that the proposed decoupling of current aid for tobacco will not have a negative impact on the revenue of farms.</p>
<p>The productive reorganisation of tobacco farms, and particularly the abandonment of tobacco production by farms whose market receipts do not cover the variable costs of tobacco production, may have a negative impact on employment in the sectors involved in the tobacco economy during and after production.</p>
<p>The Commission is not, however, aware of the existence of any quantitative analytical instrument for evaluating the impact on employment in the tobacco-growing regions.</p>
<p>Despite this absence of precise quantification, the Commission recognises, however, the importance of this production to the economic survival of certain regions and wishes to prevent the negative impact on local employment of a modification of the current type of aid. This is why it has proposed that a proportion of the funding currently dedicated to direct aid to production should be transferred to a ‘restructuring’ envelope, intended to increase the current rural development funds for production regions and to promote the economic diversification of these regions with a view to guaranteeing the maintenance of jobs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0607"></a>

<p>(EN) The protection of the euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting is the responsibility of the relevant national authorities, the European Central Bank (ECB), Europol and the Commission/OLAF.</p>
<p>The roles and responsibilities of these European institutions and bodies are complementary.</p>
<p>The Commission/OLAF has responsibilities in three areas:</p>
<p>Implementation of legislative issues, particularly the Regulation 1338/2001, and of the Framework Decision of 29 May 2000 on the protection of the euro banknotes and coins with criminal sanctions;</p>
<p>Training and technical assistance (co-financing of projects for the protection of the euro banknotes and coins under Pericles programme);</p>
<p>Co-ordination of Member States actions for the technical protection of the euro coins against counterfeiting, including the European Technical &amp; Scientific Centre (ETSC).</p>
<p>For the accomplishment of these responsibilities, the Commission/OLAF collaborates closely with the Member States and manages a number of working groups.</p>
<p>The Commission is in the process of evaluating the compliance of the legislation of all countries in the process of accession with the Community acquis. The acquis includes appropriate rules which oblige applicant countries to fight counterfeiting of currency.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking concrete action and assisting the applicant countries in the following domains:</p>
<p>Modifying the criminal legislation in the applicant countries</p>
<p>Improving the structure for the fight against currency counterfeiting through creation of the appropriate services</p>
<p>Organising and co-organising training of staff (police, judicial, financial) in these countries with regard to techniques and procedures in the fight against currency counterfeiting</p>
<p>Developing further the co-operation through regular meetings between experts from these countries, experts of the Member States and the European institutions.</p>
<p>This allows the applicant countries to be brought up to the standards of the EU countries with regard to the protection of the euro.</p>
<p>In addition to those measures taken by the Commission, the ECB and Europol undertake activities to facilitate the exchange of technical and operational information respectively with these countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0610"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for her question on raids on fur farms. There have indeed been a number of worrying incidents in this area.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to reply the Honourable Member that Europol does not gather information on the number of crimes committed by groups claiming to protect animal rights by carrying out raids on farms. The reason is that this type of crime is not included in the crimes for which Europol is competent according to the Convention of 1995 establishing Europol.</p>
<p>As regards the question if 'eco-terrorism' falls within the sphere of cross-border crime as referred to in Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union, the Commission would like to point out that the list of offences contained in that article is an indicative one (‘in particular’). Article 31(e) by contrast refers specifically to three categories of offences, among which terrorism and organised crime.</p>
<p>Concerning the question regarding the Framework Decision on combating terrorism, this was adopted on 13 June 2002 and Member States had to implement it in domestic legislation by 31 December 2002. The Commission is currently drafting a report on its implementation, which should be the basis of the Council assessment before the end of next year. The phenomenon described by the Honourable Member as ‘eco-terrorism’ would only fall under the scope of this Framework Decision provided it fulfilled the conditions laid down in its Article 1(1), namely when it may seriously damage a country or an international organisation and if it were committed with the aim of:</p>
<p>seriously intimidating a population, or</p>
<p>unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or</p>
<p>seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.</p>
<p>The question as to whether or not the Framework Decision should be amended or complemented might be considered in view of the Commission's report, on the basis of a possible perceived lacuna.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0615"></a>

<p>(EN) Around 15 million new jobs will need to be created in the Union-15 if the Lisbon targets of a 70% employment rate by 2010 is to be achieved; 22 million new jobs for the Union-25.</p>
<p>This means in particular that more entrepreneurs are needed to generate more jobs. Self-employment in the Union has remained stable - at about 14% of the workforce - in recent years.</p>
<p>Self-employment is one of the possible expressions of ‘entrepreneurship’, a virtue that needs to be encouraged in Europe for its contribution to competitiveness, innovation in new goods and services, and adaptability in the face of restructuring and sectoral change. But entrepreneurship is not Europe's strong point. There are two main reasons for this.</p>
<p>The first one is ‘cultural’. European attitudes towards entrepreneurship are regularly examined in surveys and they show reluctance towards entrepreneurship among citizens. Europe's education and training systems must better value entrepreneurship and prepare students for careers as entrepreneurs. All students, whatever the branch they study, should get at least basic management skills. It is also essential to modify the perceived imbalance between the risks and the rewards associated with entrepreneurship; insolvency law, for instance, should not create excessive risks for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The other reason for lagging entrepreneurial dynamism is related to the framework conditions for enterprises to start up and expand. The time and costs involved in setting up a business, the administrative and regulatory burdens, the difficulties in accessing financial resources, particularly micro-funding, are all well known problems. Services which assist small- or medium-sized businesses to start up and survive are of critical importance in this respect.</p>
<p>A number of European initiatives and programmes are relevant for self-employment and entrepreneurship. Both the European Employment Guidelines and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines contain recommendations to Member States to support entrepreneurship through improvements in the business environment. The Action Plan on Risk Capital addresses the issue of access to finance. Their implementation is being closely monitored by the Commission.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives are taken in the framework of the Commission's Enterprise Policy. The ‘‘ among other things supports Member States’ efforts to improve their performance by learning from best practices, through projects carried out in selected policy areas under the Best Procedure. The European Charter for Small Enterprises demonstrates the Union's commitment to create the best possible environment for small business and entrepreneurship. To set a future agenda for entrepreneurship policy in Europe, the Commission recently issued the Green Paper ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’. The discussions around this paper involved a wide number of stakeholders in defining the action needed to produce more entrepreneurs and to get more firms to grow. On the basis of this, the Commission is now preparing an Entrepreneurship Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0617"></a>

One of the logos appearing in the advertisement was that of the EU Cohesion Fund. In reality, the project in question is one of those intended for the Municipality of Madrid under the National Waste Water Plan adopted by the Socialist Government in 1995, which does indeed receive European funding. The measures planned under the National Waste Water Plan appear in the investment annexes to the NHP, which list projects already approved and budgeted for prior to the adoption of the NHP law and are therefore not part of the new projects currently being assessed by the Commission. The content of the advertisement wrongly suggests that the entire NHP is already receiving European funding.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that some of the projects considered in Annex II of the National Hydrological Plan law have benefited from financing through Community funds. There are two main sources of Community sources of financing for water management projects in Spain: the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>As far as financing from the Cohesion Fund is concerned, a series of such projects have been approved to date. The Commission publishes regularly information on these. Some of the projects concerned may have been included by the Spanish authorities in their National Hydrological Plan. This decision is entirely a matter for the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>As far as projects financed under the Structural Funds are concerned, these are decided by the national authorities within the context of a programme agreed with the Commission. The Commission does not possess detailed information on all the projects and the amounts concerned except for major projects of more than EUR 50 million (‘major projects’).</p>
<p>It is the case that all assisted projects, both under the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds, must comply with Community legislation, including environmental requirements, in all respects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0625"></a>

<p>In 2000 the Lisbon Strategy was adopted with a new strategic objective for the coming decade: to become the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with the prospect of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and a higher degree of social cohesion. To achieve this objective a comprehensive strategy is needed. It is now three years since that objective was set out, but progress remains limited. One reason for this is that the Member States are not implementing Community decisions quickly enough. Another is that the Member States are looking more to their own interests than to the common interest.</p>

<p>(FR) The Lisbon European Council established a very ambitious agenda for the Union with a view to 2010: to become the most competitive economy in the world, guaranteeing full employment and cohesion. The Gothenburg European Council added environment and sustainable development, thereby making up a global strategy aimed at strengthening and modernising the European development model.</p>
<p>The European Council in March is the annual opportunity to assess the progress made and to adopt new actions, on the basis of the report the Commission will adopt in January.</p>
<p>In its annual assessment, the Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concern with regard to the involvement of the Member States in the Lisbon agenda. Several elements are combined: the delay in the adoption of several outstanding proposals by the Council, the delay in the transposition period at Member State level, and finally the partial or ineffective implementation of the reforms adopted.</p>
<p>These elements are one of the main challenges for the Commission in 2004 and beyond if we are to see concrete results on the ground, for companies and for citizens.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently considering the content of the next spring report which it must adopt in January.
