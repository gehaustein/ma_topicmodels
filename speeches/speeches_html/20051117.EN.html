So, after paragraph 33 there is a new section and, in order to dispel concerns and to ensure the full support of the socialists, I fully confirm that the title of the section has been changed, and is [in English] ‘Strengthening effective multilateralism’. The second oral amendment relates to paragraph 34 and is as follows – the following words shall be included after: </p>
<p class="contents">‘... takes note, as stated by Dr Hans Blix, that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.’ </p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I speak on behalf of the great majority of the GUE/NGL Group. We voted in favour today, even though this legislation it is not as strong as we would have wished, because we need legislation that will protect lives and workers’ health, as well as the environment. We are very pleased that the packages we have agreed with others on authorisation and on the duty of care have been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation of chemicals within the EU must give proper protection to workers, consumers and the environment while, at the same time, being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry and thereby ensuring jobs. We are very disappointed with the Nassauer-Sacconi compromise on registration. The challenge was to agree a registration package for collecting the information needed to assess the risks. With the deal that has now been agreed, the necessary information will not be available.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a strong REACH regulation that will give us the information needed to assess whether chemicals are dangerous, even those chemicals produced in low tonnages. We want legislation with mandatory substitution of the most dangerous chemicals. The burden of proof must be with the companies and not with public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with these principles in place that public health and workers’ health is best defended. Every serious impact assessment of the REACH proposal shows the immense health benefits of a workable chemicals policy and this is in stark contrast to the exaggerated industry calculations. REACH should be a matter of common sense. Companies should know what they are doing and should be held accountable for their products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has led to the huge economic costs that may arise from the entry into force of standards contained in the first version of REACH. Indeed, the UK Presidency accepted Germany’s request to postpone the decision on REACH, scheduled for the next Council of Ministers, on the pretext of the country’s new government being delayed in taking up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, this is the first reading of a text that is very much a backward step, although there were some positive aspects on which progress was made and which must now be promoted until negotiations with the Council have been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">REACH creates a single integrated system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals in the EU, the purpose of which is, firstly, to control and replace the most dangerous chemicals (which cause cancer, change DNA and damage the reproductive system, among other serious health consequences); secondly, to provide safety information on all chemicals at registration stage; and, thirdly, to pass on information to consumers, workers and distributors.</p>
<p class="contents">If we continue to buckle under pressure from the European chemical industry, the aims of the programme could be watered down and devalued. This would actually make it far more damaging than the current legislation, if public health and safety are not safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have therefore supported the line taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. With this end in mind, today’s vote saw the adoption of a number of improvements to the Commission proposal:</p>
<p class="contents">1. the compromise reached by Mr Sacconi and Mr Nassauer on the subject of registration, which markedly reduces bureaucratic demands;</p>
<p class="contents">2. the exclusion of substances regulated elsewhere or not presenting any potential risk;</p>

<p class="contents">It has to be said, though, that the vote saw the adoption of a number of negative and indefensible points, notably amendments imposing time limits on authorisation. This is impractical, bureaucratic and unnecessary in terms of the protection of health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Since improvements had been made to three essential points in the Commission proposal, I voted ‘yes’ in the final vote.

Things should never have been allowed to come to this pass, in which people work with substances about whose side-effects no information is available. The essential thing in future is that it be ensured that newly-registered substances are harmless.</p>

<p class="contents">We will certainly not achieve this objective, though, if the original proposal is so watered down that, out of 100 000 untested chemicals, 88 000 stay that way. It is for this reason that I voted against the reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel satisfaction on the one hand, concerning the principle of substitution for problematic substances: obligatory substitution (Amendment 232) and research for safer alternatives (Amendment 214). It is the first time that the European Parliament has declared itself in this way in a text of this importance. Having said that, it is impossible for me to take any pleasure in it, when, in the same text, and before the process, Parliament totally alters the registration procedure for two thirds of the substances concerned by REACH, those of less than 10 tonnes: tests reduced in the extreme and depending on risk and not tonnage. In my opinion this does not afford even basic safeguards with regard to health and safety for the people most at risk.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite this, we support the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, who proposes an outright rejection of this proposal about the humane trapping of certain animal species. Humane means both ‘human’ and ‘decent’. People have, over the course of time, done the most hideous things – things that may have been human but were certainly not decent.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission proposal, amputations, eye injuries, bone marrow injuries and a struggle for life lasting up to five minutes are considered humane. Since 1995, wildlife traps have been banned across the European Union, and an import ban has been introduced on animal skins from countries where such traps are still in use. There was a proposal to tighten up the requirements for other traps as long ago as 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">A lobby of trappers then managed to sideline the experts. Subsequently, an agreement was signed with the USA, Canada and Russia, which was mainly intended to avoid trade conflicts rather than to improve animal welfare. This proposal is founded on this flawed agreement, something to which this Parliament has objected before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are full of bombast and hypocritical interest, without ever naming who produces, spreads and uses these weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">In earlier and in modern times, WMD have always been used to subjugate peoples to imperialist rule. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the USA. Napalm bombs were used for the first time in Grammo against the Greek Democratic Army and in Vietnam by the USA. Depleted uranium was used by the USA and ΝΑΤΟ in the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia. Chemical and biological weapons were sold to Saddam by European companies and were used recently by the USA in Faluja. When and whenever WMD have been used, they have always had the identity of imperialism.</p>

<p class="contents">The report leaves no room for doubt. Its aim is to take arms policy out of the hands of the Member States, or rather, certain ‘small’ States, and gradually to set up a ‘European defence market’, in ‘accordance with accepted NATO standards of interoperability’. To this end, it calls on the (‘large’) Member States and the large armaments firms to set aside their differences, arguing that steps should be taken to ensure that ‘defence procurement is covered to a larger extent by European Community legislation rather than by national legislation’ and that ‘a restrictive interpretation of national security interests is appropriate’.

We object to the idea in Paragraph 9 that foresees defence procurement being covered by EU rather than national legislation. The proposal in paragraphs 10 and 15 for a directive to supplant Article 296 would have serious national security implications. Moreover, the promotion of a system of "European preference" for national defence purchases in paragraph 24 is a short-sighted idea that would do further damage to Europe's ailing militaries.

At the same time, they are using the statements as a pretext for accusing Iran of supporting 'international terrorism', thereby defending the US policy which is threatening Iran and Syria with military intervention. It is no coincidence that the Prime Minister of Britain, which also has the Presidency of the ΕU today, spoke directly about military intervention in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted against the motion for a resolution not because we have any feelings of solidarity with the Iranian regime, but because we do not recognise any right of the ΕU, ΝΑΤΟ or the USA to pretend to be the upholders of human rights and international law, when they themselves violate them shamelessly and support all forms of autocratic regimes, when they serve their interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Restricting the scope of the resolution to President Ahmadinejad's call to 'wipe Israel off the world map' was a wasted opportunity to highlight Iran's apparent determination to make a nuclear bomb and its widespread human rights abuses, including the regular execution of consenting homosexuals and others who commit acts branded by the regime as 'crimes of sexual chastity'.</p>

All of us in this House have, for whatever reason, agreed on a timetable, and one of the stumbling blocks was that the Council will be discussing this topic next week and that we would like to make our contribution in good time, rather than when everything has been done and dusted. That I regard as unworthy of this House. If, then, we postpone the debate and the vote, we are not taking our work as a Parliament seriously. Moreover, I do not think that the final vote will be affected since the nominal lists have already been drawn up, so why do we not just go ahead and have the debate and the vote today?</p>

I would have preferred to vote this morning in plenary, but there was no majority support within the groups for this view. Had we done so, we would have at least achieved the majorities with all MEPs attending. Given that the vote has already been rescheduled three times, it is now, in my view, too late.

We are within the scope of Rule 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure, which states in the second sub-paragraph, ‘The intention to move adjournment shall be notified at least twenty-four hours in advance to the President, who shall inform Parliament immediately.’ It is clear that this condition has not been met: the adjournment was not requested twenty-four hours in advance. I am therefore obliged to proceed to the debate, all the more because our rapporteur so wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise, ladies and gentlemen, that a debate of such importance deserved a larger audience. I must, however, make two observations. Firstly, as a general rule, our debates rarely fill the House, be it a Thursday afternoon, a Monday, a Tuesday or a Wednesday. Secondly, our calendar is set up in such a way that Parliament sits on a Thursday afternoon. One cannot, therefore, discriminate between Members who make the effort to stay and those who prefer to attend to other business.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we shall proceed with this debate and hand over straight away to Mrs Martens, our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maria Martens (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission proposes a long-term strategy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by 2015. This can only be applauded. We need a very ambitious plan to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and, above all, to get sub-Saharan Africa on track. The question is now whether the proposed strategy will help achieve this in the best possible way. The strategy clearly outlines the problems, and I share its cautious optimism as regards the development of the African Union and NEPAD.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy has certainly come up with excellent ideas as to how problems may be solved, one example being the extremely important emphasis on the principle of ownership. After all, if Africans cannot take their fate into their own hands and take responsibility for further development, any strategy is doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is the world’s largest donor. For years, Europe has given money and aid, and yet there is more poverty than there was before. A new strategy is therefore needed. Unfortunately, the document cannot really convince me yet that it really represents a U-turn. Why not? There is certainly nothing wrong with its analysis or the goals, but the proposed ways and means leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is right in saying that we must provide more and better aid more quickly. We cannot do this by giving more money alone, even if we are talking about a few billion extra. It is great that Europe wants to free up more funds, and the Commission wants to remind the Member States of their financial commitments, but we need more than that. I am thinking first and foremost of what we can do in our own policy, about the three Cs of coordination, coherence and complementarity. If they do not improve, then chances of more effective aid will quickly dwindle. Much will ultimately depend on the political will of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will find an effective strategy to promote those.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission acknowledges the fact that major differences exist between the African countries. The different situations and problems are described accurately, but clear, appropriate instruments that address those differences are lacking. In our view, a clear distinction should be drawn between aid to stable countries and aid to countries that are unstable socially and economically due to bad governance, corruption and mismanagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is possible, as the Commission proposes, for stable countries to be helped under certain conditions, even via budgetary support and sectoral aid, unstable countries also deserve our support. We cannot turn our backs on those people. In those unstable countries, we should not call for aid to be granted via the governments, but for aid via social organisations, which must specifically involve religious communities, as these reach out to many people, after all, and can benefit health, education and other basic provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission proposes that our efforts for Africa be, from now on, grouped together under three strands. The first strand is promoting security and good governance, which is important. The second strand is that of economy and trade, and guaranteeing a better investment climate, which is also important. Only the third leg of the action plan concerns poverty reduction via the Millennium Development Goals, such as promoting basic health care, improving education, protecting the environment and creating jobs for as many people as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the latter, the Millennium Development Goals, should be central. Poverty reduction is critical in order to achieve structural stability so as to, in turn, allow further development. That is why, in our view, all policies must first and foremost be an instrument geared towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. That is why we feel that major infrastructural works in Africa or exchanges between twin towns and universities in the European Union and Africa are premature. They are valuable projects but would be more suitable at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to this report, whether inside or outside this House, for their contributions to the thought process. I can look back on a pleasant and constructive working relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately.’ That means, in practical terms, that we shall proceed to the vote at the end of this afternoon’s debates.

(FR)</span> Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, Africa is the continent that poses the greatest development challenges. Progressive desertification, the shortage of water, famine and HIV/AIDS have reached critical levels there.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is the continent where there are more donors than anywhere else. It is therefore the continent where the need for coordination and complementarity is the most urgent. Countries such as Tanzania or Mozambique each have to manage some 500 individual projects funded by European donors in the social infrastructure sector alone, even though the amounts devoted to each of these projects are relatively small.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is also the continent that offers us the greatest opportunity today. The birth of the African Union and the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, the reinforced role of Africa’s Regional Economic Communities and the emergence of a new generation of leaders at national level have changed the way Africa is governed. New glimmers of hope for peace are being seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia, Burundi and Liberia. This continent, which is the ecological lung of the world, has unrivalled wealth when it comes to natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a future demographic power. By 2025, the population of Africa will have grown to more than 1.3 billion, almost as large as that of China or India, and greater than the combined populations of the European Union and the United States. It will also have the advantage of a younger population, since at that time almost 800 million Africans will be under the age of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever, this Africa deserves Europe’s full attention. That is why the Commission has proposed a new Strategy for Africa, which was adopted on 12 October and presented in this House the very same day, a strategy intended to provide the European Union with a single, comprehensive and long-term framework for its relations with Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mrs Martens, ladies and gentlemen, the Strategy for Africa is based on three main themes: one Africa, one Europe and one objective.</p>
<p class="contents">One Africa: while Africa has many faces, different histories and diverse needs, it has now collectively embarked on a path of political, economic and cultural integration of the entire continent, crystallised in the integration efforts promoted by its Regional Economic Communities, the launching of the African Union and NEPAD. In short, this is integration that deserves our unconditional support.</p>
<p class="contents">One Europe: Europe has also changed. The enlargement of the European Union to include ten new members has taken the number of potential individual partners to 26: the 25 Member States plus the European Community. This development has increased the European Union’s potential political and economic impact, but the enlarged membership also poses new challenges in terms of aid coordination and complementarity. The European Union Strategy for Africa will therefore make aid effectiveness and donor coordination central priorities in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">One objective: Europe’s policy on security, for example, has for a long time coexisted – not always happily, I might add – with its development policy. Recent experience – and I am thinking in particular of the Peace Facility for Africa – shows how intimately security and development are linked and how important it is for European policies in these areas to be closely coordinated. In the European Union Strategy for Africa, the common objective is, therefore, to promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa. Our overall strategy comprises a series of specific proposals, as you know, and I am glad to see that we largely agree on these points, some of which appear in Mrs Martens’s report, such as strengthening the Peace Facility for Africa, and strengthening the role of national parliaments and civil society organisations in planning, prioritising and – let us not forget – scrutinising development cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreements as a development-centred tool for liberalisation has the potential to promote economic growth in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to creating an attractive climate for reliable and predictable investment, to foster this we have, as you know, proposed setting up a permanent European forum bringing together African and European entrepreneurs, and building infrastructure in the widest sense of the word, including water, energy, ICT and transport, as provided for in the Europe-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget either the launch of a new European Union Programme for Action to confront HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; the emphasis placed on higher education alongside the efforts being made in basic education, and the increase in budget support. The Commission and the Member States will indeed have to endeavour to make the transition from aid projects to sectoral approaches and to direct budget support on that basis. No doubt we will be returning to this during the course of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, increased coordination of European aid and the implementation of a roadmap on coherence, coordination and complementarity seek to ensure that the European Union cooperates more effectively on development.</p>
<p class="contents">These, then, are the main themes of the Africa strategy. I am delighted to see that Parliament finds its concerns reflected in our three basic concepts and in the specific proposals. Mrs Martens’ report and the motion tabled are ambitious. I am delighted; I thank you for this and I congratulate you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on its opinion on this report was very lively, but it did eventually adopt it unanimously. It is unfortunate that there was later majority support for a Conservative motion that there be no demand for a debate on the role of colonialism, which I believe would be important in the African context.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, our opinion states that fundamental human rights should be respected when dealing with refugees and illegal immigrants on the EU’s African borders, which I recently visited with a delegation. There one sees concrete evidence of the means currently adopted by the EU to combat poverty, in the shape of fences and walls, and that is highly problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we call for a debate on the social responsibilities of governments and businesses as an integral part of the new Africa strategy, to which the Commission certainly needs to make some improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion also addresses the need for the proposed cuts in measures to combat HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis to be reversed, and stresses the importance of promoting peace and conflict resolution in Africa, with consequent specific reference to the control of weapons exports, which we debated yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">This prompts me to mention that I have taken note of the speech made by Commissioner Michel to the Parliamentary Assembly of the WEU on 21 September, in which he said that EUR 250 million for African troops was to be taken from the development budget. That I regard as the wrong way to go about it, and I warn the EU against conflating its security or military policies with its policy on development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her report reflects reality and lays down the prospects of the development strategy for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Africa, where most of the less developed countries are found, is due both to endogenous and to extraneous factors. Addressing the endogenous factors is the responsibility of the African governments themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the overcoming of extraneous factors concerns us and not only because the European Union is by far the biggest donor of humanitarian aid. It does not concern us only in the sense of increasing aid to 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product by 2015. It concerns us in the sense that development aid will, as the report emphasises, go hand in hand with its improved quality, effectiveness, transparency and visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge to the European Union consists, in my opinion, among other things:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in overcoming the fragmentation of humanitarian intervention and in constructing a cohesive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in linking the Union's policy with the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in establishing effective coordination of humanitarian aid between the Member States and the Commission and between the Union's bilateral policies and its development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Action by the Union should obey a clear timetable, specific targets and the need to link objectives and means. This need is indicated, among other things, by the report, which I endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner condensed the challenge of Africa in his phrase: 'One Africa, one Europe, one objective'. 'One Africa' is the responsibility of Africa itself, 'one Europe' is the responsibility of Europe and 'one objective' is our common objective. We support this eminent initiative of yours and will respond convincingly to the challenge of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It received widespread support and our vote in the Committee on Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time now to comment on the main body of the report, with whose resolution we Socialists will agree provided that it is not altered by means of amendments in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time we have been arguing that Europe has an ethical and political responsibility to make a decisive contribution to development in Africa, but in recent times it should be clear to everybody that that development has also become absolutely essential in order to maintain both stability on the international scene and stability and prosperity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we agree with Mrs Martens that to do everything possible to help Africa out of its dramatic situation of under-development must become a genuine priority within the European Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it is essential that we see our role as one of accompanying the African leaders in the implementation of their own decisions. We are therefore concerned about the fact that the Commission’s Communication, to which Mrs Martens’ report refers, does not make more reference to the African Union and to the strategic plan that the Heads of State in that sister institution have defined as strategic priorities for the development of their continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we are making the mistake of defining priorities off our own backs that do not coincide with those of the people mainly affected, partners to whom we have a commitment in terms of achieving the objectives that we have been discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside the input we have received from the Council concerning Tony Blair’s Africa Commission and the UN Summit, the Commission’s proposal contains a good many constructive features relating to the environment, good governance and the fight against poverty. We have also noted that women and equality have been included as part of the picture and that importance is attached to women’s importance as driving forces in the development of society.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, use the short period I have in which to speak in order to highlight an alarming aspect of the proposal, namely the unduly centralised way in which EU aid to Africa is planned, using for example a Donor Atlas, as if we in Europe could sit and plan how aid is to be coordinated in the individual African countries. This practice is in direct conflict with those principles of aid effectiveness and good donor behaviour that the EU helped adopt at the Paris High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in March of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the African countries that should have the crucial role in coordinating aid, proceeding on the basis of their own strategies for combating poverty. If we do not provide aid in that way, we shall be in danger of seeing a veritable invasion of white elephants in Africa, and that would mean a return to a very bad strategy. We must stand by what we have said so far. Quite a few of the amendments in the Martens report take account of these centralist measures on the part of the Commission, and I hope that Parliament will ensure that the recipient countries, and not the Commission, continue to play a pivotal role where aid is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up to now, every government has, in its dealings with Africa, pursued its own interests, formulated its own strategies for development cooperation and created its own structures to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">Coherence and improved coordination of aid are, as I see it, very important if we want to make a real contribution to combating famine, preventing violent conflicts and keeping states from disintegrating. Clear distinctions need to be drawn between the African states in terms of their social, cultural, economic, political and environmental development, and any European development strategy needs to take account not only of this but also of African people’s prospects and of the conditions and processes in their own countries. Any development strategy for Africa needs to be influenced by the knowledge of Africa’s regional organisations, elected parliaments, the organisations of civil society and trade unions concerning the processes and approaches involved in finding solutions to the maladministration of their own countries and to removing it. Only then will the criterion of ‘ownership’, on which so much stress is laid in the report, make any sort of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the African Union responded with outrage to the questions he was asked about the tragedy of the refugees in Melilla, and he had every right to do so, saying, as he did, among other things, that these people were not lazy, and that the EU’s, and the USA’s, agricultural subsidies had to be seen as questionable. The Committee on International Trade, in its opinion, emphasised the importance of, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the abolition of export subsidies as a means of enabling Africa to become an equal partner in world trade, but the Commission’s development strategy, makes no clear commitment to this. This strategy will make aid more efficient only if it is understood as a guideline for cooperation with the various partner countries. Any such framework for the EU’s development cooperation must take account of the diversity present within Africa and make use of Africans’ experience and know-how. Only in that way can this strategy make a real contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot help but point out, however, that it makes no direct reference to certain issues that are of absolutely key importance, both for Africa and for other very poor countries. We will not help these countries merely by setting up funds, or by cooperating with the same old organisations. We need to draw attention to the fundamental goals, the most important of which is education, education and education. Further goals include hygiene and health, and support for the local economy. I would repeat that it must be the local economy that receives our support, since this is what will help people on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this report would be a very welcome development, if it were not for the unfortunate fact that it has fallen victim to something that crops up all too often in this House. An ideological slant has been put on it, which is entirely uncalled for in a debate such as this on aid for developing countries. Once again, ideological references to reproductive health and reproductive rights have been included, even though they are completely out of place. We really cannot allow every text we adopt to be peppered with various extraneous references of an ideological and feminist bent, for they are indeed feminist. They are entirely uncalled for in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call on the House to lend its backing to the amendments tabled by Mr Szymański. Amendments 1 and 3 highlight the fundamental goals to which I referred, namely food, clean water, better sanitary conditions, vaccinations and mother and child care. Amendments 2 and 4 seek to delete the reference to reproductive rights, and to replace it with a reference to basic health care. We really should not put an ideological slant on every debate held in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As things stand at present, the prospects are very poor and I find myself wondering what we can offer if this round proves a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, I asked Commissioner Mandelson what he thought of the idea of a free trade area covering Europe, the USA, Canada and Australia. What would become of the countries of Africa? Would they then have to organise themselves, or would they have to conclude bilateral agreements with these great world markets? Whom would that benefit, and to whom would that be disadvantageous? It is in difficult times like these that we have to ensure that these multilateral talks are beneficial to these countries, and that requires the facilitation of trade, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, this is where we have to take ‘free SMEs’ as our watchword, with free markets for small businesses; cooperation between family businesses in Africa, in Europe and throughout the world, needs to be promoted as the basis for prosperity. What is needed to do that is a fair system of public invitations to tender, proper competition law and, finally, if these businesses are to be willing to become active in these countries, their investments have to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">That does, therefore, raise the question of how we can turn development aid into helping people to help themselves, into helping our small and medium-sized enterprises? What sets Europe apart is that we are in a position to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and this is where there is much for the European Investment Bank, among other bodies, to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To combat it as effectively as possible, we need to offer women, men and adolescents a complete range of care and services. We need to guarantee access to irreproachable information and education on sexual and reproductive health, make training women a priority so as to make it easier for them to make decisions on issues of sexuality and reproductive health, and thus offer them the means and methods necessary to protect themselves from HIV infection. Just 1% of those infected with HIV/AIDS benefit from antiretroviral treatment. We need to do all we can to widen access to generic AIDS drugs.</p>

Every 30 seconds a child in Africa dies of malaria, and yet there are a number of actions that could put a complete stop to that. Bed nets are a low-tech method of protection from mosquitoes, but very few families have them. Great progress has recently been made in Spain on a vaccine against malaria, but at the moment Bill Gates and other private foundations are putting a great deal more money into this than international bodies. It is clear that much more can be done and that more funding would make a huge difference, so what excuse can we possibly have not to provide it?</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns an area in which the European Union actually has been spending money, and needs to continue to do so without counting the cost too closely. This is our support for democratic elections in Africa. I was in Ethiopia in May, and just recently in the Congo observing the electoral registration process. Such action does not come cheap. The total bill was EUR 242 million, with 80% of that provided by the European Union. However, this is the first step on a very long road for a country facing enormous difficulties in terms of lack of communications and lack of infrastructure. Only by putting in the funding to enable the democratic process to get off the ground can we hope to start to see some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody can pretend that democracy is the answer to everything, but without fair and free democratic elections many other things are simply impossible. So when we look at what we are spending where, we should think very carefully about refusing a budget to actions that are proven to make a difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s fundamental desire to provide aid of this nature was enshrined as long ago as 1950 in one of the opening paragraphs of the Schuman declaration. Ever since, it has been a familiar refrain in the EU, which has been accompanied by efforts undertaken, since the Year of Africa, by the world’s developed countries to address the same questions, namely decolonisation, immigration to Europe, the need to build and maintain infrastructure, to build wells, to introduce irrigation, education, efficient farming based on agricultural production, to reduce nomadic pastoralism and to implement the forest planting plan as a key factor in the fight against the increasing desertification of the Sahel.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to such measures, the resolution before us builds on experience gained in other less-developed parts of the world by promoting the development of micro-loans based on the empowerment of women, the further development of education and health in conjunction with the UN and, as soon as possible, the achievement of the target of 0.7% of GNI earmarked by all developed countries for development aid to the world’s poorest countries; and this is something that we believe to be appropriate. Conversely, the temporary liberalisation of economically underdeveloped countries, in particular with regard to services of public interest, and the privatisation of state enterprises, have always proved detrimental. How can we recommend such measures? This reservation notwithstanding, I support the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its analysis not only highlights the continent’s potential, but also sets out the way things actually are. Alongside the various positive developments in some African countries – South Africa, of course, but also Botswana, Ghana and, it is to be hoped, in Mauritania too – there is a much longer list of countries suffering from conflicts, whether internally or with their neighbours, widespread poverty, and the illnesses to which reference has already been made: HIV/Aids, malaria, tuberculosis – the great scourges of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">If we ask ourselves why it is that Africa has lagged so far behind other continents, we must, of course, look not only at Africa but also at Europe and the other continents. Looking at Africa, we see that there are in many places governments or elites that obviously rather misunderstood what was happening at the time of decolonisation and started to see themselves as replacements for the former colonists and to treat their own people in the same way as the European colonial powers had evidently done before. They obviously had no conception of what development means or of how independence should be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, though, that we have to recognise, if we are honest, that it is Europe and the other continents that bear the greatest responsibility. We need only consider how European powers continue to interfere in Africa, whether directly, using political or military power, or by arranging things so that they can develop their own raw materials for their own companies and retain access to them. This is what I think makes it really necessary that the Commission should, by its approach, more firmly constrain the Member States to pursue a coherent policy towards Africa, which will enable us to abandon these contradictions and secure that continent a better future than it would have otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, there can be no question that the continent poses a political, economic and social challenge to Europe as a whole. We are not shirking our responsibility, since the EU has increased the aid it provides to Africa by 0.14% of GDP, and half of this money has been earmarked for the sub-Saharan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two extremes we must avoid when taking action to help Africa. One such extreme is the attempt to replace policy making with charity, the end result of which is to turn Africa into a bottomless pit and to help it to do almost everything, by which I also mean taking decisions on its future. The other extreme is to take the entirely opposite approach, or in other words to leave Africa to its own devices. We are delighted that the African Union is playing an ever greater role. I hope that as this body assumes greater importance, institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation will become more democratic, for example by ensuring that more developing countries are represented within them. This is a point I should like to emphasise most strongly.</p>

With the exception of perhaps one or two points, I can wholeheartedly agree with all of the comments that I have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to say that I obviously agree that there is a need to improve the coordination, convergence and coherence of actions, and that this forms an essential part of the communication and the political line that I am trying to develop. As you will be aware – and I think that Parliament will be able to offer very effective help here – in this connection I have made a proposal, currently being debated by the Council, to quickly implement an action plan, an action plan that does not consist only of words, no, an action plan comprising genuine and tangible commitments, such as, for example, a joint country strategy paper for the Member States and the Commission. We could debate this together. It will not be compulsory for the Member States, but I believe that it would nonetheless be a significant step forward if, instead of having 26 documents or 26 different strategies, one per country, we had just one. It would be worthwhile. That is what I have proposed in the action plan. A second aspect would also be to have joint programming. This would be a further strand of this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, I have to admit that the Council is hesitating and that we are doing all we can to actually push this small measure through. It is difficult to achieve, despite the fact that it would obviously only be on a voluntary basis, as development – as I have had occasion to say in the past – is an area of shared competence; there is therefore nothing to fear in terms of Member States’ sovereignty, but it would constitute quite significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the three pillars are concerned, obviously the Millennium Development Goals are the priority. I see that everyone agrees on this point. But I think that it is difficult to isolate this third pillar from the first two, because we cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals without peace and security and Africa itself shows that we cannot achieve them if we disregard growth and interconnectivity. It is clear that without infrastructure, without measures to open up the regions of Africa and without genuinely transcontinental infrastructure enabling production to be economically liberalised – I am thinking in particular of sub-Saharan Africa – the task will be extremely difficult. If we do not combine the third and second pillars then development will be reduced purely and simply to a large-scale charitable operation, which no one here wants, with the inevitable result that the developing countries will be dependent on us, the donors, which we do not want either.</p>
<p class="contents">To respond to Mr Pflügler, who made sure to raise the issue of human rights, I obviously agree with him that this is absolutely crucial. One brief comment, however: I think that if, under well-defined conditions, we were able to increase the proportion of budgetary support, we would be in a better position to negotiate substantial improvements in human rights, but this is a debate to which we will no doubt have the opportunity to return.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as business is concerned, as I have said, I am working on this at the moment – I announced as much and I will shortly be presenting the communication in question – and I have put forward the idea of having an ethical and social label for companies working in developing countries. I have also proposed setting up a permanent Europe-Africa business forum.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the fact that I apparently proposed a reduction in the AIDS budget, I am not at all sure where that information came from, but it must be a misunderstanding. What is true is that, when I went to London to the Global Fund Replenishment Conference, I unfortunately only had EUR 90 million available to offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like nonetheless to remind you – I am not after all going to take the blame every day – that Europe provides more than 60% of the donations to this Global Fund. This is not insignificant. The contribution of all of the Member States and the Commission represents a little over 60% of the Global Fund. I therefore did not propose reducing our contribution to the fund; I simply placed in it the money that I had for this financial year, for 2006, all of the money that I had left for 2006. I cannot do anything for 2007, because we do not have the financial perspective. Besides, I have to confess that the whole business is rather comical: the UK Presidency was pushing me to go further, but it was easy for me to reply, ‘I would be happy to do so, but you will have to help me out here.’</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the African troops, I should like to clarify matters a little. I think that in principle you are right that the money required to fund the Peace Facility should come from a source other than the development budget. I think that we agree on the principle. But if we do not have a financial perspective, and if the evaluation that is going to be made of the effectiveness and the positive impact of the Peace Facility – an evaluation which will obviously prove to be very interesting and very positive – concludes that we need to allocate more funds to this Peace Facility when there is no financial perspective, I wonder whether one solution might perhaps be to use certain uncommitted funds, to convert resources that are already committed, resources that we know full well will not be used for some time, as a means of provisionally replenishing the Peace Facility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like all the same to remind you that there is still around EUR 35 million in the Peace Facility. But you should be aware that our work is not finished in Sudan (Darfur, and so on). No doubt we will also need a stronger Peace Facility in the DRC at some point; at least this cannot be ruled out. As for Somalia, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister of that country yesterday and he too needs the Peace Facility to be stepped up in his country as a means of guaranteeing security. I can therefore safely assume that this facility is going to need a lot more money. I fear that we will not be able to leave Sudan in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that this Peace Facility is an extremely useful, indeed indispensable, tool, if we want Africans in principle also to take ownership of issues such as conflict prevention, peace-keeping, post-conflict situations, and so on, so as quite simply to create the conditions for a return to stability. In conclusion, I assume so. I have to be pragmatic. It is very easy to say, ‘The principle please, nothing but the principle’. The result? There will not be another euro to put in the Peace Facility, and we will find ourselves totally powerless to pursue the policies that we have to pursue. I hope that as soon as possible we will have the financial perspective and the Stability Instrument, which should, under normal circumstances, finance the Peace Facility and enable the problem to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I did not fully understand with regard to coordination amongst the African countries. Mrs Auken, I am in favour of also encouraging coordination between the African countries. Coordination is required at every level: at national level, because it is our aid and because it has to fit in with the government’s poverty reduction strategy; at regional level and at international level, with the other donors. I sincerely believe, therefore, that coordination is also an important factor, over and above coordination between our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it was Mr Libicki who highlighted the need for aid at local level. I agree wholeheartedly. Moreover, that is precisely why we have set aside significant sums to support decentralisation. I have had a meeting with Ousmane Sy, the former Minister of the Interior in Mali, to whom we have, by the way, recently awarded a prize in Belgium, to discuss this: he is preparing a study on decentralisation for the Commission, for me in this case, with particular reference to the DRC. He has considerable expertise on this subject. I have also personally chaired working meetings in Rwanda on decentralisation and I have seen evidence of the positive impact that this has had on the ground. I therefore share this point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do not think that we are adopting an ideological stance by referring to reproductive health. I would say that this is not about ideology but about humanism, and humanism, I believe, is part of the common heritage of all democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the WTO meeting in Hong Kong, Mr Rübig, as you well know, we are very mindful of this issue and we are still hoping that we will be able to reach a positive agreement in Hong Kong. As far as your proposal for the EIB is concerned, I can tell you – and this is important because it is along exactly the same lines as you suggested – that we are working with Mr Philippe Maystadt on a proper strategy. At the very beginning of next year – I met Mr Maystadt on Monday and we will be having another meeting in December – we will probably be signing a memorandum of understanding between the EIB and the Commission so as, firstly, to pool resources, but also to ensure that the decisions taken by the EIB that relate to development take better account of the development aspect and of the risk associated with that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have already responded to Mr Schapira in my answer to another question: the European Union – the Commission and the Member States together – contributes more than 60% of the Global Fund. Mrs Hall believes that we should put in more funding. I would say that we are obviously heavily involved in preparing for and monitoring elections, whether it be in the DRC or elsewhere, and you yourself wanted to highlight the fact that we have made a difference in the DRC, so far. This does not mean that everything is going to be easily resolved and that the situation does not remain fragile, but I see that so far, the latest figure – I receive figures every day – for voters who have registered in the DRC is 21 761 000. I have to tell you that we had set a target of 15 million: we are well above that and it is all the same encouraging to see that the population has responded in such great numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as malaria is concerned, be assured that, as part of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, the Commission is funding the necessary research to find a vaccine for malaria. We are very much involved here too, as you are concerned that we should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gahler said that the countries of Europe often continue to act like neo-colonial powers, by for example controlling natural resources. I have nothing to reply on this point. Let me simply tell you that my entire strategy seeks to move us away from these habits or reflexes, whether conscious or not, of paternalism and neo-colonialism. To conclude, I should like to say that the very foundation, the philosophy, underlying what we have proposed, is the principle of ownership. Moreover, I hope, Mr President – and I will conclude with this – that the translation of the word ‘ownership’ has been corrected in the French version: it had been translated into French using the word for ‘property’, which is not really the same thing as ‘ownership’. Ownership is therefore at the very heart of this new relationship that we want to establish with our African friends.</p>
<p class="contents">There you have it, Mr President; I think I have been as comprehensive as I can. In any case, I should like to thank all of those Members who have supported us so actively. In particular I should like to thank Mrs Martens, who has drafted an absolutely outstanding report. I hope that all of this will help us in Monday’s Council meeting to make progress on our common cause, which is our concern for Africa and the need to open up to this continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support the request to provide this strategy with adequate instruments and resources together with precise deadlines in order to be able to assess its progress. I also agree that it is a priority to coordinate the policies of the various Member States so as to prevent actions from being duplicated. It is important, however, that the EU finally assumes its due role at international level as a leader in the fight against poverty. Africa, the region which concentrates the highest number of people living below the poverty line, the worst kinds of transmissible diseases, infant and maternal mortality and a lack of education and health structures, represents the principal challenge to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Europe’s cooperation actions therefore need to be supported by a firm policy of international diplomacy that consistently promotes suitable economic and social policies within international organisations, primarily the UN, the IMF and the WTO. This policy should also promote dialogue with all the recipient countries so that these countries can eventually play an active role in establishing their own strategies and in managing the programmes, with the full participation of civil society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, the EU does not, however, have an overall view of development issues. In the present situation, the EU hands out resources with one hand, only to take them back with the other. That is not a credible way to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal should concern the EU’s need to carry out radical overhauls of its agricultural, fisheries and trade policies. Unfortunately, there is no political will in this Chamber to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Presidency and the Commission have stated that development issues in Africa are a policy area to be given priority. Despite that, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament all defend the EU’s fisheries agreements. These agreements are principally aimed at guaranteeing the EU’s short–term economic interests, and they generate extremely limited resources for those who need them, namely poor fishermen in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, as a matter of urgency, prevent the fragmentation and duplication of aid. I do not, however, think that the EU’s role should be that of leading the world on this issue. We do not need more aid organisations but should, rather, endeavour to pool our common efforts within already existing organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary task of the EU should be to reform the Union’s destructive policies. If that is not done, the developing countries will never be given a fair opportunity to achieve increased prosperity and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

The European Parliament has, for the first time, been invited to participate actively in devising the EU’s development policy. When the current policy was decided on, Parliament was not involved in any way. In our view, the ongoing process, aimed at producing a tripartite agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, is a great step forward. The present report constitutes Parliament’s response to the original proposal for a policy statement and our contribution to the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the original development policy was adopted in 2000, our world has undergone a number of changes. There are therefore powerful reasons to amend our policy and to design a new one. The agenda has changed, and issues of coherence, coordination and so forth have been given ever greater prominence. This is a quite splendid state of affairs, I think. Our report refers to the commitments to increased aid that have been made by a number of Member States and that will mean that the volume of EU aid over the next few years will be significantly increased. That is, of course, excellent. It is, however, just as important to debate quality as quantity. That is something we are trying to do in a constructive way in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the EU is the world’s leading aid donor. However, the effectiveness and quality of our aid have not, to date, been commensurate with its volume. Commissioner Michel himself did of course indicate a large number of major shortcomings, especially in the way in which aid has been coordinated in the past. There is poor coordination between one EU Member State and another, as well as between the Member States, on the one hand, and both the Commission and other donors, on the other. This means high transaction costs and a great deal of duplication, together with difficulties for our partner countries. The new development policy we are now debating establishes favourable preconditions for progress in this field. Issues of harmonisation are being given prominence.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to donor coordination and coherence, our report highlights a number of substantial issues to which we want to give added weight. These include democracy and human rights, measures to combat corruption, the important roles to be played by civil society and also by the national parliaments, the importance of strengthening the role of women in development work and the importance of paying more attention to the significance of natural resources, that is to say of forests, farmland and water and marine resources, especially in relation to the world’s very poorest countries. In addition, we discuss the importance of health and education issues, which we have been pushing for many years in Parliament, as well as increased efforts to combat the HIV epidemic. Finally, we refer, in particular, to the considerable problems encountered by many countries in tropical areas due to the more unstable climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my colleagues for their very constructive cooperation. In my view, we have produced a kind of consensus document. There is one aspect with which we are especially pleased, namely the fact that, together with the Commission and the Council, we have, in this process, succeeded in conducting a constructive debate in which we have tried, as far as possible, to define the specific role of the Commission in the context of development. The Commission must not act as a 26th Member State in terms of aid donations, but must, naturally, make use of its special authority, its special capacity, its neutrality and its multilateral character in order to give some impetus to these issues and make certain things better than other institutions are able to. In this process, we have identified a number of areas in which the Commission, if I may put it like this, can make a difference and add value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank you for your constructive cooperation. I hope that, during the next few weeks, we shall be able to arrive at a final document and that, in time, we shall be able to return to this question here in Parliament and have a broader debate in which the Council too can participate so that we might together also discuss how, subsequently, we might best begin to implement the new development policy and this policy statement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.  (FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Wijkman, ladies and gentlemen, I think Europe has demonstrated its aspirations this year. It has proved that it is capable of carrying some weight in the world. It has done better than others in assuming its responsibility towards the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, in May the European Union gave some strong commitments to make its aid more effective and its development policies more coherent. In June, the European Union decided to double development aid between 2004 and 2010 so as to reach the target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2015. I would nevertheless point out that this commitment means an increase of EUR 20 billion a year by 2010 and EUR 46 billion a year in 2015. In September, the European Union’s intensive preparatory work made the UN World Summit a milestone, a key point in the quest for a more balanced multilateralism and a more just world order. I think we can say without any conceit that without the European Union that summit might well have ended in hopeless failure. There, too, the European Union made all the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">There is obviously still plenty of room for improvement, however. If Europe wants to carry more weight, it must do more and make a qualitative leap in the way we work together. That is why in July we put forward the proposal for a European consensus on development, a proposal I have presented and discussed in this House on several occasions. The interinstitutional debate that followed this document’s adoption by the Commission shows the diversity and wealth of opinion on the European Union’s role in the world. It is also an enlightening debate and one about which I feel strongly. I cannot deny, however, that some of the arguments being put forward by major players trouble me. Some give the impression that we have to decide between a Community development policy and the policies of the Member States, between those who would like to centralise development policy at European level and those who believe solely in bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">That, ladies and gentlemen, is not the issue. Europe as a whole today has more than 20 000 diplomats, three times more than the United States; is it acceptable for it to frequently take second place in political planning? When Europe is responsible for virtually 60% of development aid, is it today acceptable for it always to dispense that aid through 26 different programming documents and implement it using 26 different procedures?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the answer is no, it is not acceptable. Europe’s influence and effectiveness must be on a par with its resources, and that is precisely why I have suggested to the Member States and the European Parliament a common platform for the European Union as a whole, a platform that will bring together its values, its aims, its principles and its field of action and will apply to the European Union as a whole. This platform, the European consensus, would be an essential step towards more coordinated, more complementary and more resolute action by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? We, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, share the same values, the founding values of the European Union. We share one paramount objective: the eradication of poverty wherever it is found. We share an international agenda: the Millennium Development Goals and the Millennium Declaration. We share principles of partnership: shared responsibility between industrialised and developing countries, the appropriation of poverty-reduction strategies by the partner countries, the involvement of civil society and non-state players. We share the principles of aid effectiveness: concentration rather than fragmentation of efforts, coherence of policy, coordination and division of labour between donors, the harmonisation of our procedures, alignment with the partner countries’ strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution presented by Mr Wijkman today is remarkable. It highlights the key positive elements of the Commission’s communication and makes a constructive contribution to improving the consensus; it was a great help to us in our tripartite discussions and I thank him for it. I congratulate him and your Parliament, too, on the exceptional quality of this contribution. I would like to give you a brief summary of the points of the resolution, which I support unreservedly, the points that form the basis of our consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a clear reference to the statement on development policy in the regulation that will govern the financial instrument for development cooperation. I have no doubt that this response will strengthen the very status of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the analysis of poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon requiring a range of responses and a balance between the socio-economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the importance of equality between men and women. In this connection, I would like to inform you that the Commission has proposed including Parliament’s text among the guiding principles of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it takes a rights-based approach. I believe the Commission’s proposal of including human rights and governance as complementary objectives to poverty reduction meets Parliament’s request perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, all the priorities mentioned in the resolution are covered by the Community’s fields of action: the prevention and treatment of Aids and other diseases, reproductive health, gender equality, adjustment to climate change, trade for development, conflict prevention, good governance, preventing corruption and promoting decent work, which includes preventing child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are very pleased that Parliament is open to a move towards budgetary support, because that will enable us to be effective and to develop countries’ capacities. In this way, we can help to improve the management of public finance and support institutions, including national parliaments. Those institutions must play their part fully and act as budget guardians. At the same time, I am convinced that this is a powerful way of initiating and fostering political dialogue with our partners. I therefore thank Parliament, which with this resolution is making a significant contribution to more effective action for development and laying the foundations for close collaboration between us in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This aim of this tripartite statement, which sets out a common vision for the European Union’s development cooperation, is to help achieve greater cohesion, coordination, complementarity, quality and effectiveness. One might well say that it will be impossible for our vision of development cooperation to become reality unless these goals are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the 40 years that development aid has been provided to Africa, the situation on this continent has got worse rather than better. We must do something to reverse this trend, and this report and the motion for a resolution are an attempt to bring about such a change.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution covers many key issues, and I should merely like to draw the House’s attention to a few of them. One example is the weight attached to the role of national parliaments in implementing development cooperation. This applies not only to aid recipient countries, but also to certain EU Member States. On a related note, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will adopt its report on the role of parliaments in implementing the Cotonou Agreement next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be absolutely delighted if the parliament of my own country, the Polish Sejm, were to devote more attention to development issues. This is all the more necessary because it will be hard for us to earmark 0.7% of GNI for development aid in future unless national parliaments show commitment and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial feature of this resolution is that it highlights the key importance of education. It is a simple fact that development will be impossible without access to education, and without gender equality in the field of education, though of course not only in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also deserves our praise because it stresses the need to improve the quality and the level of coordination between the Commission and the Member States. I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What we are discussing now is what the European Union’s policy in the field of development should be over the coming years. This is a field that directly affects millions of Europeans, many of them committed and public-spirited young people; the kind of citizens whom we should try to win over to the project of European integration. Nevertheless, the way we are treating these issues today, as if they were something entirely marginal and insignificant, will increase their indifference, their scepticism and their rejection of what the European Union means.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we support what the Commissioner has said and, in particular, the excellent report by Mr Wijkman, and we would like to acknowledge his good work and his efforts aimed at synthesis and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialists voted in favour of the resolution and it was approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Development. We believe it to be correct and we hope that it is not changed for the worse by certain amendments, which would oblige us to vote against the final text.</p>
<p class="contents">Something quite different, however, is the document resulting from the negotiation between the Council and the Commission, quite rightly with the participation of Mr Wijkman, on behalf of Parliament’s Committee on Development, a participation which has certainly contributed, as Commissioner Michel has acknowledged, to the incorporation of many of our principal concerns and demands in this field into the ‘European development consensus’ statement.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to make it clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that approving the resolution proposed to us in the Wijkman report does not presuppose that the text agreed by the Council and the Commission will be approved and that, in order to be endorsed by Parliament and hence be a tripartite agreement, it must have the express support of the plenary of our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much regret the lack of will on the part of the European Parliament to promote a genuine development and cooperation policy. Instead of resolutions that tend to be forgotten rather quickly, it would be better if Parliament played an active part in drawing up a definite coherent strategy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate and thank Mr Michel, the Commissioner, for his initiative in seeking to define, in a tripartite statement of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, the common principles to which the EU and the 25 Member States will refer in implementing their development and cooperation policies. It will give the European Union a document setting out the European consensus on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">We see this as a major advance for at least two reasons. First of all, it is the first time that Parliament has been involved to this extent in the process of mapping out this policy. Through their representatives, the peoples of Europe are therefore having their say on the major directions of development and cooperation policy. Secondly, and this is a real step forward, the hour has finally come to look for synergy between Member States and the Commission when action is taken. How can we respond to this initiative if we vote at the end of the part-session and almost in secret, when everyone’s mind has today been focussing on one of the main issues of the legislative period?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is no point in going into the substance of the debate that took place in committee; that would not bring anything more at this present time. Today I want in particular to congratulate our rapporteur on his commitment to this matter and the successes he has already achieved following his conversations with the Council and the Commission. By taking account of the suggestions made by the members of the Committee on Development and managing to incorporate them into his text, the rapporteur has united a very large majority in support of his approach, affirming, for example, the desire that the joint statement should stress questions of education and health. Having said that, I would like to make one thing extremely clear: my group’s support for today’s report in no way prejudices our position on the final draft of the joint statement. That requires a solemn vote by Parliament. If we want this Commission initiative to be fully effective and the joint statement really to reflect the European consensus, it is and will be essential that the European Parliament gives its verdict on the final text in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has emerged from the trialogue is a good initiative, and it is, procedurally speaking – as has already been noted – somewhat uncharted political territory, so we are again particularly grateful to Mr Wijkman for having done such efficient work in the trialogue for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and for this House and for having produced this fine report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report and this consensus can be a significant step closer to more coherence in European development policy. There is, after all, a great deal of consensus in this House as to what its objectives are, and on the pre-eminent importance of combating poverty, which is not just about pushing poverty back, but also about uprooting it, establishing social justice, creating equal opportunities for development and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. So much for the theory: we have to be clear in our own minds that the practice falls a long way short of that. The new ‘Human Development Report 2005’ tells us that the number of people living in absolute poverty is continuing to increase dramatically.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right, then, that we should concentrate our efforts on investment in food safety, education, health and social security. The developing countries need to be helped to go their own way; they need to keep control over their own development strategy, and so it is right that the principles of ownership and partnership should be centre stage. The European Union must scrutinise all policy areas in terms of their impact on development, especially the policies relating to trade, agriculture and fisheries. That is the theory; now, in practical terms the policies of twenty-five countries need to be more closely coordinated. We would like to see more coordination on the part of the Commission and the Council and more co-decision for Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s efforts at development cooperation must have the overall objective of reducing poverty, and eventually abolishing it, through sustainable development. That is what makes it simply vital that the document we have before us today again clarifies the need for countries’ debts to be set aside and for it also to be ensured that they never again fall into the debt trap, for example by increasing the funds supplied to them as grants.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer, both the UN and ‘Global Health Watch’ repeatedly pointed out that the last ten years have seen an extraordinary increase in the inequalities between and within countries, between rich and poor, and that we in the EU need to do more to face up to the situation of the poorest in the world. Above all, it is they who are hardest hit by the consequences of privatisation and the increasing exclusion from such resources as land, water and woodland. More and more, too, they are denied access to food, health, culture and education, and so we need a development policy that addresses these tasks; the aim of producing a document expressing the consensus of the three institutions of the European Union is one that I can only welcome. Mr Wijkman, who is representing the Committee on Development in the negotiations, has our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have all seen evidence of the fact that the former are rapidly leaving poverty behind them, whereas the latter are incapable of extricating themselves from extreme poverty and health problems, in particular HIV-related problems. The reason for this can be found in people’s mindsets and a lack of education. We should take this opportunity to place particular emphasis on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I believe that Mr Wijkman has drafted an excellent report, I must unfortunately voice my objections once again to the House. My question is why this report contains a reference to reproductive health and rights, which after all is just another name for abortion. It is no secret that the House is divided on this issue, and yesterday we witnessed incidents in connection with the exhibition held on Parliament’s premises. I fail to see the point of this ideological approach, which means that we are confronted time and time again with an issue that divides the House. We should hold a separate debate on the issue, instead of bringing it up at every given opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the House to vote in favour of Amendments 3 and 4, which have been tabled by Mr Szymański. They seek both to delete the reference to reproductive rights and to highlight the fundamental goals, which include adequate food, clean water, better sanitary conditions and education.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard Commissioner Michel complain in this House about the fact that there is no such thing as an EU common foreign policy in this area. One can only wonder how such a common policy could exist, given that we witness attempts to undermine it at every step. Russia engages in policy-making with France and Germany without any regard for Poland, or at least this has been the case with governments to date. I hope that the new German government will adopt a different approach, and I also hope that things will change when President Chirac leaves office.</p>
<p class="contents">The solidarity we show to our immediate neighbours in matters of common interest will be a measure of the European Union’s success, both at EU and at global level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Wijkman, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you all. You have clearly played a vital part in the work that can be presented today. I hope that Parliament’s contributions will enable the final document to meet with everyone’s satisfaction, an outcome that would constitute an extremely important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kaczmarek has spoken to us about the role of the national parliaments and I am inclined to agree with him. If you recall, moreover, I travelled to a large number of national parliaments in order to defend the increase in public development aid in the various countries, and I would like to take advantage of being given the floor to confirm that I am always willing to go and answer questions or to participate in sittings within the national parliaments. I believe, in fact, that in a number of countries it is helpful for the national parliaments to be mobilised, informed and motivated with regard to the issue of development. I am therefore fully prepared to dedicate myself to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Martinez, you say that the current statement is disappointing. I readily admit that it is not perfect – that goes without saying – and I hope, moreover, that we will further improve it. That said, this statement does, despite everything, already constitute an important step forward, as this would be the first time that the European Union had access to a framework in this area. This would also be the first time that a policy was endorsed simultaneously by the Commission, by Parliament and by the Council, and that Parliament, like the Commission, would find itself providing, in my opinion, a more powerful lever for making development policy more effective and better coordinated. Therefore, I too of course would like this statement to be far more ambitious. Admittedly, it has been toned down at certain times but, believe me, we have not finished with our endeavours, and I am obviously relying both on Mr Wijkman and on certain Member States at Council level to help us to preserve the best and most progressive aspects of the statement.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mrs Zimmer and the debt issue, we obviously agree on the fact that the debt burden must be reduced. On the other hand – but this would undoubtedly be another debate – I am not wildly in favour of simply cancelling the debt without any conditions and in all circumstances. However, I am resolutely and fervently in favour of reducing the debt or of cancelling it in very special cases and under very special conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Libicki, I believe that this is a point on which we will not be able to agree. Your approach in terms of reproductive health differs from mine. You look on reproductive health as an ideological issue and I do not, because I, for my part, have a humanist outlook on the issue. I do not look on it as an ideological issue. Secondly – and I in no way intend to cause controversy here – I believe that you are confining the issue of reproductive health to abortion. I can see many other aspects to reproductive health; I can see above all the health and the rights of women and children. I am therefore not ideological.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply call on you to understand the reality in certain countries and in certain societies – I, in fact, encounter this reality on a very frequent basis – and I should truly like to be able to convince you that much still remains to be done on that score. Certain kinds of old-fashioned, conservative opinions – and I say this fully respecting the philosophical thoughts of others – do not seem to me to be overly generous in their responses to certain human tragedies with which I have come face to face. I therefore cannot accept this criticism. I am not prejudiced and I can respect everyone’s thoughts, philosophies, religious and other beliefs. I do believe, though, that at some point we should nonetheless go beyond those beliefs in order to see what really constitutes the general interest, in order to see what generosity really is and in order to learn how action should really be conceived for the best. This is what nevertheless seems to me to be a goal to achieve over and above any religious, ideological and philosophical divisions.</p>
<p class="contents">During recent months, Mr President, your Parliament has worked tirelessly to respond to the Commission’s offer and to contribute to obtaining a European development consensus representative of the will of the three European institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council. This joint effort is testament to the importance we all attach to development and shows that the institutions are working together to make our action more effective. We are right to do so. I have said many times over that development policy has the potential to be an important tool in making Europe a presence and a positive force in the world. Development policy could also play a crucial role in the Union’s foreign policy on account of its exemplary nature, not necessarily through its interventionism, but through the positive example it sets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a role based on a long-term view rather than on short-term interests. This is a role that is focused on the well being of the people of developing countries, as well as on our own well-being. I believe that we are faced with a political decision: either we exploit this capacity in order to combat the negative effects of globalisation and in order to exploit the latter’s full potential fairly, or we stick rigidly to a charitable idea of development and wait for this idea to get completely out of hand, resulting in terrorism, massive and unmanageable migratory flows, pandemics, financial instability, poverty and destitution. Globalisation unites the North and the South and, in my opinion, development policy must act so that this union might be a source of justice and shared growth, and not one of dependency and poverty. The discussions with the Council are still taking place. The new development policy statement has not yet been finalised. What is more, I believe that, if everyone makes more of an effort, we are now really very close to a European development consensus. It simply remains for me to call on you to make one final effort together to follow up our joint work, in the spirit of the partnership that has united us over recent months with the aim of achieving our common objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner, I should, at any rate, like firstly to thank you for your active contribution to the debates concerning my remit and my department, both for your pertinent questions and also, Mr Martinez, for your impertinent questions. I believe that it is crucial for the Commission permanently to be under pressure from Parliament because this is how progress is made. I believe that progress has never stemmed from consensus <span class="italic">a priori</span>. Progress always stems from tensions and from a clash of ideas, and I therefore thank you for having participated in this work. I believe that, without Parliament, I would have been very much worse off than I am today, and this without even mentioning the statement we have come up with today, which would have been far drearier than it is. I believe that we have here the grounds for drafting a fine text, which will represent a substantial step forward. In concluding this debate, Mr President, I wanted, for my part, to thank you once again for this contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Already there have been 74 000 deaths and getting aid to those in need is a race against time. The Pakistan Government has put the financial cost of the earthquake at USD 5 billion. The EU has already contributed substantially, but we must do more, much more, and so should the rest of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not just about money; it is about access; it is about helicopters and other equipment to reach inaccessible areas. Access over the line of control between India-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is also of vital importance. I am very pleased that India and Pakistan have opened the five crossing points for goods and I hope other crossing points will be opened as well, not just for goods: civilians should also be allowed to cross. People with relatives and friends on the other side want to help. They want to bring much-needed support and relief, and at present they are unable to do so. Already, 950 Kashmiris on the Indian side and 2 000 on the Pakistani side have asked for permits. I know it is difficult because of the long-standing dispute over Kashmir, but I hope that the applications can be processed quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">This human tragedy demands a compassionate response. Let us hope that out of this terrible tragedy something good will come and that the survivors may be allowed to live in peace. I hope that, at last, a just solution to this 58-year dispute over Kashmir can be found, involving both Pakistan and India but, above all, the Kashmiri people who have suffered enough already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on their behalf, as well as that of my own Scottish constituents, who have asked me to raise their concerns about the issue of how people are being treated after the devastating earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of utmost significance that the European Parliament expresses its opinion on the Kashmir earthquake of 8 October. At the October part-session we marked this tragic event and people passed condolences both to the victims and their families. However, six weeks after this event that has destroyed the north-west region of Pakistan and India, the scale of devastation and trauma the earthquake has caused is still being realised. It is estimated that 80 000 people are dead, hundreds of thousands of people are injured and 3 million people are homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid workers have many problems to overcome, including landslides, bad weather, aftershocks and generally difficult terrain. People in the most remote areas appear to be the hardest hit, with very many not having received aid at all. These problems are made worse by the onset of winter and, therefore, it is imperative to get the right type of aid to those who need it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is one of the most complex relief operations undertaken, it is no excuse for us not to do our utmost. The fact that most of the earthquake victims have been evacuated should be welcomed. However, snow levels are already creeping down the mountains day by day and thousands of survivors face a more perilous situation as each day becomes a struggle just to stay alive. The conditions in the temporary camps are far from encouraging and it is my understanding that the hygiene level in the refugee camps is intolerable and conditions are primitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Kofi Annan has warned us that a second massive wave of death will hit hard as disease begins to spread amongst the survivors. This is a race against time and I want to see the following action points. Firstly, although welcoming the Commission’s aid package of EUR 93.6 million, we must give more and we can do better. Official estimates state that more than USD 5 billion are needed over a period of 5 to 10 years to restore the infrastructure of the region. We need to recognise that a standard relief package is not adequate for a situation as dire as this and we need to deploy the reconstruction phase immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I strongly urge the Commission and the Council to follow the precedent following the tsunami of giving special trade concessions to assist the countries affected by natural disasters of this scale. At the very least they should implement the preferential GSP Plus scheme voted by Parliament this year to ease the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I applaud the opening of five points along the line of control on the border between Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir. Perhaps some goodwill will come out of this tragedy. I call upon Member States and the Commission to ensure that we do not fail the vulnerable and traumatised. I therefore urge you to all vote in favour of this motion. People’s lives depend upon it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it would seem that Mrs Lynne was quicker than Mrs Stihler, who was quicker than Mr Elles, and so on. On the other hand, we resume the usual order when speakers take the floor on behalf of their groups, with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats speaking first, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so on.

I was familiar with the Rules of Procedure and this procedure is, in fact, the one relating to urgent procedure, which has been dealt with in a rather special way. As for the order in which the groups take the floor, we are returning to the usual procedure, so everything is as it should be. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I want to make three comments at the opening of this debate, which I and other speakers welcome. Firstly it is one of the biggest disasters in South-East Asia. Our resolution mentions the figures, which were recalled by the previous speakers. This earthquake has killed and seriously injured more than 200 000 people. Millions of people are still left homeless, facing extreme weather conditions and all kinds of serious illnesses. More than 1.8 million people are homeless, as are about 85% of the population of Muzaffarabad, which I have visited. This is a horrifying statistic and we in Western Europe must do as much as we can to remedy this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of looking at the reaction so far, I applaud the swift action by the Commission and the Member States to give immediate aid. In this troubled part of the world, we must also welcome in particular the significant efforts by the Pakistani and Indian Governments to make sure that people can make contact across a line of control that has been impassable for more than 50 years. Hopefully this can be put into practice more.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, and most urgently, I should like to ask the Commission about recent UN figures that indicate that so far very little of the aid that has been promised has been received. We would like to know how much of the aid offered by the European Union and the Member States has reached its destination. But maybe we can make additional efforts in the conciliation of the 2006 budget next week so we can make sure that those who are homeless today will at least have some elementary cover as the winter approaches. This will supplement those really hard-earned funds raised my constituents among others to help these people who are in serious need today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the border area between China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan is one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. It is also the scene of one of the longest-running conflicts in South Asia. The border in the region is not yet properly demarcated or secured by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements. Armed conflict still smoulders under the surface. In the Pakistan-controlled area, which is virtually inaccessible, several million people have lost their homes and in some cases there is a complete lack not only of food and medicine, but also of any kind of contact with the outside world. We therefore call on all countries and organisations to help the victims. In the resolution before us, we naturally support the complete opening up of cross-border routes, including the reinstated bus link with India. It is certainly a positive development that further bus links connecting people on either side of the border in Punjab are at the planning stage, and further talks on rail links and the prospect of agreement on the joint construction of a gas pipeline in the region are developments that we naturally welcome. These measures will help to build up trust between opposing factions.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the theme of assistance to those affected by the earthquake, the aim is to provide help as quickly as possible to those who need it. Indeed, solidarity between the peoples of this divided region can help smooth the path towards solving age-old conflicts. The urgent call for local organisations to distribute assistance fairly is entirely justified. At the same time, the Commission and EU Member State governments must be called upon to speed up the assistance provided to the victims. The needs are well known and we are all aware, particularly with the onset of winter, that the saying ‘he who gives quickly gives twice’ applies more than ever before. I wish to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for supporting this resolution. I believe that the issue of peaceful conflict resolution in this part of the world is one to which we shall be returning and that the Commission will soon submit to us a report on the measures that have been taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kashmir is one of these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the earthquake that occurred in October, which caused the deaths of between 70 000 and 90 000 people and made seven million people homeless, we must respond in an immediate, urgent fashion. That is the appeal we are clearly making and which must be addressed to the European Union, to the Council and to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only stress our condolences and guarantee that we are fully committed to providing this aid. At the same time, however, we must not be content solely with the emergency action. We must tackle the more structural aspects and, in this regard as well, the European Union must commit itself to supporting the reform and resolving the structural problems that require a response, not just in terms of infrastructure, but also from a socio-economic point of view, so that, when similar events occur, the consequences are not as serious as those we are seeing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore insist to the governments of the countries affected that this would be a good opportunity to prioritise social and internal needs, to stop spending so much on military aspects and dedicate — and this is where we must support them — all their efforts towards ensuring that the best possible structures are in place and reducing the effects of earthquakes of this kind as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason I say this is because it relates to urgent crisis intervention, which in my opinion is an area where the European Union should and can take successful action. No one argues with the need for such interventions, and we can achieve our goals in this respect using existing methodological, financial and logistical resources. I have therefore been delighted to hear the comments made by all the previous speakers, including those by the Member who had visited Kashmir herself. The fact that this debate is taking place a matter of weeks after the tragedy is also to be welcomed.</p>

There can be no question that they are much more deserving than those regions and countries that recently suffered riots, and I refer to one country in particular. Even though these riots were a result of the countries’ own policies, we have heard that the EU wishes to come to their aid too.</p>

What this headline shows is that it is the people, God help them, who suffer when political tensions are in play, even in this extremely dire situation.</p>
<p class="contents">When Germans think of the artificial division of countries, they unfailingly think of Berlin. I myself have seen places in the heart of Berlin where people drowned in canals because nobody on the wall could help them, or was allowed to. What that means is that people had to refrain from doing something perfectly rational – that is, saving a person from drowning – because, at that time, the Iron Curtain was in place and political considerations prevented them from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">That sort of thing gives you a feel for what is going on in Kashmir. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this earthquake is already a terrible human catastrophe, but a winter is looming in which there will be mass mortality among the civilian population unless the powers-that-be on both sides at last get the better of their inability – which is to some extent their unwillingness – to cooperate and help one another, and unless aid gets to where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir is a victim of India’s refusal, at the time of its own foundation, to accept the country’s right of self-determination. There are now problems with Pakistan as well. The conclusion we should draw from this is that Kashmir is not merely a bilateral problem involving these two states, but also, and primarily, a problem for the Kashmiri people, and hence also for us. Not only should we carry on dialogue with both the powers there – important though they are as nuclear powers and major states – but we should also step up direct contact with the Kashmiri people and their representatives, particularly those on the local level, which is what this humanitarian catastrophe offers us an opportunity to do.</p>

Eighty–eight thousand people are missing, and over 245 million have been hard hit by the aftermath of this disaster. Even today, it is still hard to obtain an exact estimate of material losses, but it is safe to say that they are on an unprecedented scale. The UN has called on the international community to provide urgent financial assistance to the tune of USD 500 million, but the countries affected by the disaster have received only 20% of the anticipated figure, even though over one month has passed since the earthquake took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the region of Kashmir has long been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan, last year the two countries embarked on constructive dialogue with a view to ending this conflict. Following the natural disaster, they also decided to set up special crossing points along the Line of Control to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to victims in Kashmir. At present, however, only goods are permitted to pass through these crossing points, and not people. This makes it a great deal harder to distribute aid. Worse still, the mountainous nature of the region, as well as the devastated infrastructure and the lack of access roads, cause further delays in aid distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a moral obligation to urge Pakistan and India to agree to allow citizens of both countries, and not only humanitarian aid resources, to pass through the crossing points. This would make it possible for the assistance of the international community to reach those who need it most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The earthquake which devastated the area came on the back of decades of political violence, and now winter is upon them, when the infrastructure and reserves remain so fragile.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is no stranger to the Kashmir issue. Our delegation some time ago reached out to investigate a long-term political solution. It has to be acknowledged that local political progress was rather slower. Let us please hope that the earthquake can focus minds on cooperation and dialogue. Across my country, Scotland, we have seen Scots Asians reach out to their friends and relatives in Kashmir. We have seen fund-raising, donations and practical assistance. Their generosity of spirit sets us a challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now over to the politicians, and we in this House and the Commission can play our part in urgently coordinating aid, and in the long term, in helping find a viable political solution, because if there is not a political solution what other solution could there possibly be?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps there are some positive signs. Yesterday the opening of a fifth crossing across the line of control might be the start of a process that will lead to a peaceful solution. The immediate problems of the region are desperate, but as this resolution indicates, we stand ready as we must to help participate in a very long-term rebuilding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Earthquakes know no borders, however, and the recent disaster affected both India and Pakistan, uniting them in misfortune. The scale of the tragedy can be gauged from the fact that it claimed the lives of an entire generation. The majority of its victims were children and young people, and virtually no schools have remained standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a moral and political obligation to provide charitable assistance and to help reconstruct the region in the future. The USD 20 million donated by the World Bank, and the EU’s donation of less than EUR 4 million, represent only short-term aid for the victims of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Thought should also be given to the more distant future, since the effects of this disaster will be felt for the next few decades. Our debate on this issue should act as a reference point for the Commission and the Council. I should like to conclude with one final observation. According to my calculations, the EU’s financial aid for the victims of the tragedy in Kashmir amounts to 16 times less than the aid that is to be granted to France following the riots there. I have to say that I find this truly absurd. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The devastation caused by the earthquake is hard to comprehend, even after seeing repeated pictures of the suffering on our media screens and newspapers. The last 12 months has seen so many tragedies and natural disasters that have hit parts of the world: tsunamis, drought, mudslides, floods, repeated hurricanes, typhoons and now an earthquake. It is difficult to keep a focus and priority on the need for generosity and rapid relief, as we almost become conditioned to natural disaster after natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In the immediate term, the need to assemble aid and coordinate its distribution is fundamental, particularly in inaccessible parts of the disaster zones. Tens of thousands are still without shelter in inaccessible parts of Pakistan and Kashmir, and the freezing temperatures of winter are approaching. The politics of this region must be put aside in an effort to save lives, and this motion welcomes the coordination and opening of new routes between India-controlled Kashmir and the Pakistan side.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support an immediate and generous response to the call by the UN for donors to contribute more than half a billion dollars in emergency aid, much of which has not materialised yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week. Related to this motion, I believe the EU needs to show some initiative in encouraging the international community to plan for and prepare for natural disasters in the future. The reality is that natural disasters in many cases are predictable. We know the likely areas where hurricanes will strike next year and where earthquakes may strike, and we need to concentrate on building regional capacity in those regions rather than the kind of dramatic aid efforts that we are now involved in. So we need longer-term and future planning as well as the immediate aid requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, within hours of this devastating earthquake the first funding was made available, and field teams were despatched. EUR 13.6 million had been allocated within a few days. The first tranche was made available within a few hours of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission humanitarian funds for 2005 were depleted, the Commission, through the ECHO and Relex departments, requested EUR 30 million from the reserve of the Commission budget for humanitarian aid, and EUR 10 million for reconstruction. We very much appreciate Parliament’s cooperation in releasing these additional funds. As a result, the Commission has been able to provide an overall financial package, as already mentioned, of EUR 93.6 million in response to the crisis, of which EUR 43.6 million will go to humanitarian relief, and EUR 50 million to rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding to date is mainly for shelter, health – including the Red Cross field hospital at Muzaffarabad – water and sanitation, coordination, and logistics, including 11 helicopters, as was mentioned earlier today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is today leaving for Pakistan where over the next two days she will take part in the Reconstruction Conference, along with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other major international donors.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall share with you some of our main concerns today. The Commission is fully aware that the location and scale of this disaster makes it very difficult for all humanitarian organisations to deploy rapidly and deliver aid to the victims. An additional constraint on meeting needs and allocating the funds available has been the implementing capacity of the aid agencies. There must be a rapid improvement, especially in reaching out beyond the main hubs.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you that coordination is very important. Part of the role of the rapidly deployed ECHO field teams is to ensure or has been to ensure coordination. In addition, ECHO is also allocating funds to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their coordination role, including civil and military coordination of the use of military logistic support.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the issue of special trade measures, which was raised by one of the honourable Members of this House, we are determined to take Pakistan’s trade interests into account within the confines of our international obligations. Pakistan will benefit from the new GSP from January 2006. For the first time in 10 years, all Pakistan’s exports will be covered. This means that Pakistan is getting identical treatment to the tsunami-affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission are very concerned at the prospect of a secondary humanitarian disaster as winter approaches. That is your concern as well, as thousands of injured people remain stranded in isolated mountain areas without food, shelter or sanitation. A sustained wide-scale relief action throughout the winter period is therefore to be expected. It is a must for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, let me inform you that the Commission, through the ECHO DG, has just received a further EUR 30 million from the emergency reserve. I want to thank you for your support in these joint efforts to help those who are in need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the long judicial process leading up to his sentencing, Paco Larrañaga strongly, repeatedly and unequivocally proclaimed his innocence at the horrendous crimes of which he had been accused.</p>
<p class="contents">His defence team and recognised human rights organisations have complained that the trial took place without proper guarantees, with no respect for the right to a defence and that the verdict, reached despite an absence of evidence, was arbitrary and unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, last July, the Philippines Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence. When all possibilities for appeal run out, the only way to prevent the execution and to resolve the extremely serious situation of Paco Larrañaga according to Philippine law is a pardon by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Many initiatives have sought to secure such a pardon, of which I would highlight those by the King of Spain, the Spanish Prime Minister and the President of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday, the comments of a retired policeman, who had participated actively in the investigation into the crimes, to the effect that Larrañaga was innocent, were made public in the Philippines. This information, which has been widely reported by our media, confirms the validity of this resolution. The resolution defends the right to life and the fundamental rights of Paco Larrañaga. We are also defending our values: to eradicate the death sentence from the world and to restore proper judicial procedures. We support the legislative initiative of the Philippines Congress to abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">A presidential pardon would demonstrate a commitment to democracy and human rights, which would enhance the international credibility of the Philippines. The current certainty demands that we prioritise the objective of achieving a full pardon for Paco Larrañaga and we therefore believe that we should not introduce amendments that do not focus on that fundamental and urgent objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By means of this resolution, we can help to get him released from the prison in which he is unjustly being held, because it is clear that he is innocent.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I visited Francisco Larrañaga in the Philippines last week. He has been in that prison for eight years, since he was 19, and he has been on death row for two years. There are 18 000 people in that prison, of whom 1 200 are on death row, and the sentence has been confirmed in 250 cases. They sleep in the corridors because there are not enough cells there.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Paco Larrañaga was sent to that prison without any fair, credible or acceptable trial. He was not allowed a proper defence at the trial. Thirty defence witnesses were not able to speak because the judges did not allow them. When Larrañaga’s lawyers asked that the witnesses and Larrañaga himself be able to speak, they were imprisoned for contempt of court. On one body, which was found disfigured – allegedly one of the victims – no DNA test was carried out. He was five centimetres too short. The family did not recognise him and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">As if that were not enough, this case has taken a 180-degree turn this week — as my friend and colleague Antolín Sánchez Presedo has said — with statements by a policeman to the effect that Larrañaga was innocent.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the Philippine justice system has unfortunately closed the case. We must therefore support the political groups of Philippine members of parliament who are going to present a draft abolishing the death penalty in that country’s congress, so that that abolition can become a reality and the death penalty in the Philippines can come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this resolution is to save a European citizen who is going to be executed despite being innocent. We all know that he is innocent because of the evidence we have seen. I would therefore ask you to support this resolution, in order to make the pardon a reality and so that Larrañaga does not have to spend another second in Philippine prisons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current government aims to carry out more and more death sentences, even on minors who, by law, cannot be sentenced to death or executed. In its pursuit to eliminate as many people as possible, the government puts victims into isolation, tortures them and excludes them from legal assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the government of the Philippines is unable to put an end to crime and protests does not justify the use of barbaric means of this kind. Among the many people of Philippine nationality who have fallen victim to them, there is Francisco Larrañaga, who also has Spanish nationality. The fact that he has been charged with very serious criminal offences does not justify a mock trial that disregards his alibi, nor does it justify a death sentence and the exclusion, so far, of the possibility of this conviction being quashed.</p>

<p class="contents">The Larrañaga case has all the characteristics of an unfair trial without minimum legal guarantees, which is hard to accept within the framework of the international law in force. Unfortunately, the Larrañaga situation is particularly delicate, since there is apparently no means for appealing against the death sentence passed in July 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing, however, is not just the fact that Mr Larrañaga is a citizen of Spanish nationality, and therefore European, but that there are almost 2 000 other people in a similar situation. I would therefore point out that the fact that, in the Philippines, the indiscriminate detention of suspects is normal, that torture is also common currency and that these people are often kept in solitary confinement, all increase our concern about the particular case of Mr Larrañaga.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House rarely have the opportunity to analyse and deal with the situation in the Philippines. This is, therefore, a good opportunity to remember this and many other issues that concern us. In the European Union’s relations with third countries, the abolition of the death penalty should be seen as a standard that should be spread and respected by those countries that impose it if they are to enjoy normal relations with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist, therefore, that the Larrañaga case offers us an opportunity to state that the death penalty must be abolished. In the specific case of the Philippines, I would like to call upon President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to at least restore the moratorium on the death penalty and, secondly, as some of my fellow Members have also said, I would stress the need for the law reintroducing the death penalty to be repealed. In this regard, I support the initiatives that have been presented in the Philippine Congress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, no distinction is made between our calls for the abolition of the death penalty in the Philippines and the matter of the trial of the young man who has been accused of such terrible crimes. These are two entirely separate issues. Those speakers who claim that this was an unfair trial are making a very serious accusation. They are claiming nothing less than that all the successive courts in the Philippines have ruled in error, and that the President of the Philippines does not wish to grant pardons to her people. This is a different matter altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a third issue at stake here, namely the question of what we are in fact demanding. As I see it, our priority should be to demand a fair trial. After all, if the trial in question was unfair, then this would constitute a crime. If the trial was in fact fair, then we could demand a reprieve from the death penalty, but we could not demand a complete acquittal for such terrible crimes, provided that they were in fact committed. We should therefore call for a reprieve, but we should not call for a complete acquittal until a fair trial has taken place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU stance against the death penalty is based on the firm belief in the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person. The Member States, together with the Commission, have strengthened their international activities in opposition to the death penalty as an integral part of EU human rights policy. They have also adopted EU guidelines laying down the basic principles to be followed in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are currently more than 1 000 inmates on death row in the Philippines. Of these, 165 death sentences have been affirmed by the Supreme Court and can be stopped only by a presidential stay of execution. We are calling again on the Philippine President to reprieve death-row convicts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly concerned about the Supreme Court’s sentence of 3 February 2004 condemning the Spanish-Filipino citizen Francisco Larrañaga to death and the refusal to reconsider the case in July 2004, thus ending all judicial channels for appeal. On 5 July 2004, the EU Troika – consisting of the Netherlands, the UK and the Commission – handed an amicus curiae brief to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs in support of the motion for the reconsideration of the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Spanish Embassy in Manila has had the lead on that specific case, while the Commission is dealing with general issues related to the support of the campaign against the death penalty by various actors in the Philippines. The UK Embassy, in cooperation with the UK organisation Reprieve, has sent a lawyer to the Philippines for three months, starting in October 2005, to investigate the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the various internal parliamentary initiatives on the revocation of the death penalty law that are currently being debated in the Philippines Congress, and we encourage the efforts by civil society to work towards that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to insist on the reconsideration of the Larrañaga case, as he has not had a fair trial according to international legal standards. So, even if Parliament ruled in favour of the abolition of the death penalty in exchange for life sentences, the Larrañaga case would remain flawed. The EU should continue to insist on the right to a fair trial for Mr Larrañaga. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few months ago, a joint resolution condemning the gross violation of human rights in that country was passed unanimously. Unfortunately, as is often the case when dealing with totalitarian regimes, the Burmese dictatorship took only minimal notice of that resolution. The brutality and repression practised by the Burmese military against their own people has continued unabated and serious human rights abuses, including rape and pillage by government soldiers, have continued to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an estimated 1 000 political prisoners are still being held illegally and, on 2 November, 10 prominent human rights democracy and peace activists were given a total of 756 years in sentences. Needless to say, their trials were totally unfair; they were denied representation by lawyers of their choice and prevented from having access to their families.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Burmese dictators leave us with no option but to proceed with a tougher resolution, such as the one before us today. Amongst other things, we call on the UN Security Council urgently to address the situation in Burma and we insist that the EU’s common policy on Burma be strengthened by taking certain practical punitive measures. The resolution also calls for a high-ranking EU envoy to be appointed to work towards securing the release of political prisoners, helping in humanitarian issues and generally assisting and bringing about the much-needed democratic reforms in that nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the Burmese dictators will, on this occasion, take more serious note of our condemnations and concerns and that they will proceed speedily along the only logical avenue open to them, which is the one that leads to the democratisation of their long-suffering country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was able to observe on the ground the efforts made by Laos and by other countries in the region to improve their mode of governance. The European Union supports, moreover, the efforts made by these countries, and work must continue along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma, for its part, is making no effort whatsoever in terms of establishing democratic rule. The repression suffered by, in particular, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, and by her party’s supporters, requires no further mention. This repressive situation is one glaring example proving the lack of democracy in Burma. Let us not forget that the party in power took the country’s helm illicitly. It seems appropriate to me to state a few facts illustrating the tragic situation of this country and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to act as spokesman in this Chamber for Reporters without Borders and bring up the case of Win Tin, a 75-year-old journalist, who is in a critical state of health and who is still in prison when he ought to have been released for good behaviour. The list of oppressed people is obviously a very long one and, despite the 250 releases granted a few months ago – a move that should be welcomed – there remain around 1000 political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">For over ten years, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which is nothing more than a military junta, has controlled the various aspects of the country’s political and economic life. Human rights are completely lost sight of, access to education has become a privilege reserved for a tiny sector of society and freedom of expression is non-existent to the point where foreign journalists are put in prison. Any form of dissidence is forbidden. Consequently, members of the resistance, who are still active, are arrested in order to prevent them from undermining the ruling power. The situation is all the more serious because this country, which has a large number of ethnic groups, does not respect cultural diversity at all. Some ethnic groups are, moreover, enslaved.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these unmistakeable horrors, certain countries continue to trade with Burma. As a Member of the European Parliament, I call for a firmer stance to be adopted in the face of this unacceptable situation, as the sanctions that have been taken are too weak. In order to bring about some change in the current situation, I believe that it is vital to prevent trade in strategic sectors currently in the hands of the generals. It would be worthwhile to call on the commercial and industrial businesses established in Burma to set an example, so that Burma really develops into a democratic country. That is why I, of course, unreservedly support the resolution tabled by the six political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I visited the Thai-Burmese border two weeks ago for six days. I had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in Thailand that are overflowing with people who have fled from Burma’s Karen province and Karenni province. The human rights situation inside Burma within ethnic provinces is hugely concerning. The reality of war and military leaders acting with impunity results in repression and abuse: forced relocation of communities and destruction of villages, thousands of internally displaced people living in the forest, the rape of women and girls – many such incidents documented by human rights organisations, forced labour, the use of up to 60 000 child soldiers – I met two young 16-year-old defectors from the Burmese armies, and the random use of landmines by both sides littering the jungle to lethal effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The main focus of this resolution is to nudge the international community forward, to ensure that Burma is put on the UN Security Council agenda as soon as possible. The report by Vaclav Havel and Desmond Tutu makes a real, legal and valid case for bringing the Burma issue to the UN Security Council, and I support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution to the suffering and repression in Burma is not primarily about aid, although aid is required to relieve suffering. A lasting solution must be a political one. We need a real ceasefire. We need talks between the government the SPDC, the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups, with all groups having an equal level of participation. We need the release of all political prisoners, and we need to allow democracy to govern. I have no confidence that, without sustained international pressure at the highest possible level, Burma will make the positive transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I encourage the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to take a more proactive role in getting Burma on to the Security Council agenda, in particular Britain. It is somewhat ironic that it is the US that is taking the lead on this issue despite the historic links and relationship between Britain, Burma and its people. It takes 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council to sign a motion to put the issue on the agenda. We currently have eight. If the political will exists, a ninth can be found and persuaded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key problem was that the people from central Burma differed, in terms of languages and culture, from the people nearer the coast and that the indigenous peoples wanted maximum autonomy. This demand was not met; they were not even met halfway, and violent conflicts were the result, giving the army the opportunity to become even more powerful and independent, eventually seizing all the powers of the state and also a large proportion of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a strange kind of dictatorship that does not have any ideological goals that might make them more popular among certain sections of the population. Within this dictatorship, there is a continuing battle, whereby leaders are deposed and even imprisoned. Within the leading group, there are also conflicting economic interests in the extraction of minerals, in the felling of tropical rain forest and in the production of opium. The tactics used in respect of the democratic opposition are also variable.</p>
<p class="contents">The only time when free elections were allowed, the large majority had spoken out in favour of the opposition, and so the result was subsequently cancelled. A change in regime has appeared virtually impossible to date. For years, foreign companies sought financial gain from this dictatorship. Burma can provide cheap raw materials, because the people are kept more or less in slavery and nature and the environment are not protected. Under pressure from various international protest movements, those economic contacts have now been cut back considerably, but have not completely disappeared. Only continued and strengthened isolation can bring change in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the proposed resolution calls for a ban on any companies registered in the European Union investing in, or lending to, Burma. Only in that way can we help put a stop to the rape and pillaging by government troops, forced labour, forced house moves, the taking of political prisoners and the exclusion of citizens from the government in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it is appropriate and commensurate that sanctions be discussed and implemented at UN level.</p>

Another resolution will be added and I do not know what its effectiveness will be, because the Burmese people are suffering barbaric suppression of their rights through forced labour, prosecution of opponents, the enlistment of children, forced relocation and the extermination of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to all this, Myanmar has a prime position in the production and trafficking of drugs, while HIV is forging ahead and Myanmar has a terrible record in this sector. These are issues which certainly need to be addressed by the international community because, not only is the situation not improving, it is getting constantly worse. For these reasons, there is a need for the UN Security Council to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Aung San Suu Kyi, who has an international reputation and has been honoured with international distinctions, can unite the political parties and all the opposing political groups and guarantee the independence of ethnic minorities, so that at some point democratic, judicial and political change will come to Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">The report drafted recently at the initiative of President Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, which confirms with precise data the drastic situation in the country, posits this need for broader dialogue. The dialogue, apart from the internal level I mentioned, must also be held on an international scale. Consequently, I think that the European Commission should take an initiative towards the UN Security Council, so that a solution can be found for Myanmar to acquire a democratic future, although acute pressure must be exerted beforehand.</p>

Several years ago, this was more or less the reaction of one of my colleagues to the press report on the news of new natural gas deposits in the continental shelf of that South Asian country. Myanmar is currently subject to EU and UN sanctions. What is interesting is that in his report, which we have received, Sergio Vieira de Mello complains about the efforts of the military government to enshrine the role of the army in the newly drafted constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you have not misheard me; in 2005, one of the most fiercely criticised aspects of the situation in Myanmar is the role of the army in daily life and the imprisonment of hundreds of people on account of their political opinions. Yet if any of you were to think that we could be talking about Turkey or Afghanistan, you would be mistaken. Such things are criticised in Turkey as cautiously as though we were talking about the United States. In the case of Myanmar, we refer to the violence as intolerable, and the same is true for the treatment of ethic minorities. As far as Afghanistan is concerned, we are lost for words. Why not open accession talks with Myanmar and set up a free trade area and such like, as we are doing with Turkey? Is that pie in the sky? If so, then we are nothing but a bunch of impostors, applying different standards to different countries. Please do not take it amiss, but I shall not be voting for a resolution of this nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is familiar to us from images of exquisite Buddhist temples and gold-encrusted, sumptuous palaces. Yet the tragic fate facing thousands of the country’s citizens is being covered up. Human rights are brutally violated there, and thousands are either serving time in prison after having been sentenced and persecuted for opposition activities, or are subjected to forced labour. Children as young as 11 are forced to do military service, and the majority of citizens live on less than USD 1 per day. They also lack access to health care, which exacerbates the problems faced by the many people infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma has been rated 190th out of 191 countries with regard to the quality of access to health care in the country. There is no such thing as access to the Internet in Burma. Satellite dishes were banned until recently, and the country’s citizens are not allowed into the small number of hotels where foreigners have access to the foreign press.</p>
<p class="contents">All the state structures were dissolved after the <span class="italic">coups d’état</span> in 1962 and 1988, and power was seized by the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Ironically, the latter has been responsible for instituting one of the bloodiest regimes in the world. Even though a parliament was legally elected in 1990, it has not yet taken up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">The generals’ junta ignores the interventions of international organisations, whether they are undertaken by the UN or by human rights and labour organisations. There are many unanswered questions surrounding the existence of regimes and totalitarianism of this kind. The problems relate not only to the way in which power is exercised by psychopaths who exploit those weaker than themselves, but also to the difficulties involved in providing any kind of aid. The latter is an issue because the population of the country, which in any case suffers persecution and extreme poverty, is hit hardest by any embargo. The majority of economic aid provided goes into the regime’s pockets. The military junta in Burma/Myanmar uses 40% of its revenue to support or even expand its army, which is already sizeable even though the country is not at war with anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, foreign corporations should not invest in Burma/Myanmar, since such investment would effectively amount to tacit and material assistance for the army. Wherever a dictatorship exists, ways should be sought to provide help, to conduct negotiations and to cooperate with the opposition. This cooperation should take place both with members of the opposition living in the country and with those living abroad, since they will be most aware of the extent of the problem and of the most helpful forms of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling for Aung San Suu Kyi and the other opposition leaders to be released, for the National League for Democracy to be allowed to take up its work again and for humanitarian aid to be provided, thus preventing both religious persecution and the destruction of the Burmese nation and national minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danuta Hübner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission fully shares the concerns regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar, as expressed here today by honourable Members of the European Parliament. There is no doubt that several issues are of serious concern, in particular the proceedings of the so-called national roadmap, the human rights and forced labour situation and many more issues that have been mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, let me emphasise that the Commission continues to call for the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders who remain in detention. In the past, the Commission maintained contacts with most of the Shan leaders who have now been sentenced, and it goes without saying that the conduct of these politically motivated trials was unacceptable according to democratic and legal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to urge the regime to engage in a real dialogue with all political actors, including the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups. We are convinced that only a transparent and constructive dialogue between legitimate stakeholders can lead to national reconciliation and a return to democracy. Probably, the regime will deliver on its roadmap. It will probably formally accomplish the National Convention later this year and organise a referendum on the draft Constitution in 2006. The result will certainly fall short of our expectations in terms of real democracy. It should nevertheless be considered a small step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma/Myanmar is partly isolated from the Western world and partly isolating itself. However, we must understand that the country continues to enjoy a comfort zone in the region, especially with regard to its neighbours. There is a degree of intra-ASEAN solidarity, despite the position of individual political leaders in ASEAN. I mention these issues because they illustrate the difficult background against which we operate.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any doubt, we must voice our concern for the people in the country. The EU is called upon to help the people of Burma/Myanmar. The Commission therefore strongly supports a significant increase in humanitarian aid and assistance. The Commission maintains that our common position generally reflects what should be done. We should continue voicing the Union’s criticism of members of the junta and policies pursued by the regime. This can be done only if we continue the agreed EU policy by keeping communication channels open and using high-level ASEM and EU-ASEAN meetings, or the margins of such meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">An update of the common position needs to be discussed with and agreed by all EU Member States, bearing in mind the possible positive or negative developments in the country, and reflecting our values and political interests. This would also apply if the EU were to nominate a special envoy.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, in October 2004, we strengthened the EU common position. We introduced a more comprehensive visa ban and prohibited support for international financing. Any further change in the common position – apart from the fact that we would need all the partners to agree – would need to ensure the legality of such a measure under international law and ensure that the people of Burma/Myanmar did not become the victims. The people of Burma/Myanmar should not pay twice: once for living under a repressive regime and twice as a result of the economic sanctions imposed by the West.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of whether the UN Security Council should discuss Burma. Most of us have seen the recent report, endorsed by Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The report concludes that the UN Security Council should deliberate on the Burma/Myanmar issue. However, we are all aware that it will prove very difficult to pass any resolution on this subject given the reluctance of some permanent members, notably China.</p>
<p class="contents">I assure honourable Members of Parliament that the Commission will continue its work on Burma/Myanmar, stepping up its assistance for people in need and, at the same time, pressing for democracy, human rights, the release of political detainees and for democratic reform and political transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the overarching goal of our dealings with Burma is the transition towards democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This applies to all disadvantaged groups including people with disabilities and, amongst other things, encourages dissemination of information, awareness-raising, sharing of experience, training and access to justice.

In particular the EU is concerned about restrictions on, and the treatment of, civil society and human rights activists. EU Ambassadors in Tunis have discussed human rights issues with Tunisian Ministers and the Tunisian Coordinator on Human Rights.</p>
<p>In September 2005 the EU Troika attempted to deliver a demarche to the Tunisian authorities on the Tunisian Civil Society Organisation. As the Tunisian authorities refused to receive the Troika, the demarche was subsequently delivered to the Tunisian Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. The Presidency issued a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it recalled that human rights were a significant element in its political dialogue with Tunisia within the framework of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, noted with concern the situation of the Ligue, and expressed its wish that the Ligue would be able to continue its work to promote and protect human rights in Tunisia.</p>
<p>The EU has also made clear to the Tunisian authorities and all states and institutions taking part in the World Summit on the Information Society, to be held in Tunis in November 2005, that it expects them to fully respect the right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Committee, scheduled for 7 December, will provide an opportunity to raise the human rights situation with Tunisia. We also hope to take forward the establishment of a Joint Subcommittee on Human Rights, to which Tunisia has committed itself under the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.</p>

A final decision on the funding for 2006 will be taken by the Council and European Parliament as part of the 2006 budget agreement.</p>
<p>A decision on the funding for the remaining seven years of the assistance scheme will be taken by the Council and the European Parliament under the next Financial Perspective. The Commission is proposing that transitional assistance will be delivered through country plans prepared by the ACP countries themselves, in consultation with the Commission. I am not sure that I would wish to comment on extending the CAP but can say that development assistance is provided to the ACP under the framework of the Cotonou agreement though the European Development Fund. This assistance is centred on the objective of poverty reduction, in line with the objectives of sustainable development and progressive integration of the ACP countries into the global economy, and this includes support for agriculture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0938"></a>

<p>Furthermore, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 639/2003, the payment of a refund is subject to compliance with the provisions of Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport, which provides for a mandatory veterinary check for all transports at the point of exit from the customs territory of the Community.

<p>(EN)The Council is deeply concerned at the continuing lack of progress in the Eritrean-Ethiopian peace process, and at the current tension, including the Eritrean ban on UN helicopter flights and restrictions on UN vehicle movements.</p>
<p>The Council remains convinced that the achievement of lasting peace between the two countries and a definitive solution of the outstanding territorial issues must be based on the Algiers Peace Agreement, including the acceptance of the decision of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission on the demarcation of the Eritrean-Ethiopian border as final and binding. Similarly, the Council fully supports the calls made on the parties in various UN Security Council Resolutions on Ethiopia and Eritrea, including Resolution 1622.</p>
<p>The EU continues to call on both countries to accept as final and binding the decision of the Boundary Commission, and to take steps so that the demarcation of the border can proceed.</p>

<p>(EN)The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the human rights situation in the Russian Federation, in particular the situation in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p>The Council has made its concerns known many times about the lack of fairness apparent in the handling of the Yukos case, and the impact this has had on investor confidence.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware that the penal colony in which Khodorkovsky and his co-defendants are currently held violates their human rights.</p>
<p>The Council regularly raises human rights concerns with Russia in the framework of the political dialogue, at a technical as well as a political level. For example human rights issues were raised at the latest EU/Russia summit in London on 4 October 2005 – at which there was also a substantive discussion of the North Caucasus. The EU is also actively engaged in biannual human rights consultations with Russia. The latest round took place in Brussels on 8 September at which, amongst other issues, we raised in detail our concerns about human rights abuses in Chechnya and the Russian judicial system.</p>
<p>The Council continues to support a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya which has the support and confidence of the Chechen population, and has called on the Russian authorities to ensure that the Parliamentary elections in Chechnya at the end of this month are free and fair.</p>
<p>The Council is encouraged by the recent EU Ambassadors troika visit to Chechnya and the North Caucasus. Under the auspices of the Chechen Electoral Commission the troika met representatives of all eight parties standing in the upcoming elections. The Council hopes that these parties can command the broad support of the Chechen population necessary for a peaceful solution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0968"></a>

<p>From the very start the Council, when granting the Commission its negotiating mandate, considered that the negotiation process should be an inclusive one, potentially covering all the countries of the region, including Turkey. Turkey did participate in all the stages of the negotiation and the treaty, as now signed, explicitly foresees the possibility for new parties to join at a later stage.</p>
<p>The Council takes it as a positive signal that Turkey was indeed present at the signing ceremony and therefore expects negotiations to continue with this key country for the region.

<p>(FR)The Commission is contributing to the fight against malaria in the context of national support and through its Programme for Action to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This programme, which was adopted in May 2005, sets out the main areas of intervention with regard to external actions. The Commission acts at both national level and worldwide.</p>
<p>At national level, the Commission acts through political dialogue and financial support with the aim of improving access to, and the continuity of, health services and systems, which is one of the prerequisites for the essential provision of malaria prevention, treatment and care.</p>
<p>Worldwide, in recent years the Commission has quadrupled its investment in the fight against malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to an annual average of EUR 259 million over the period 2003-2006. This includes EUR 475 million of funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria over the period 2001-2006. The Fund has earmarked 31% of its resources for programmes to combat malaria, on the basis of the requests made by the countries themselves. The Global Fund is currently the leading player in the fight against malaria.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports the fight against malaria through the 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. Funding quadrupled between the 5th and 6th Framework Programmes and now stands at an annual figure of EUR 400 million for the fight against these three diseases.

<p>One of the ideas put forward with the aim of finding new ways to provide development aid is that of a worldwide lottery, the proceeds of which would go to development-related programmes.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme has confirmed that such a lottery would be entirely feasible, and believes that it could raise at least USD 500 million per year (with four draws).</p>
<p>It is, of course, up to national governments to set up such a lottery. However, the European Union could make a positive contribution by encouraging its Member States to take the initiative together. There are also legal considerations: almost all our Member States have laws that lay down the legal status of lotteries and allocate most of the proceeds to the State. The establishment of a worldwide lottery would therefore require all the countries involved to pass a law at national level authorising the establishment of a worldwide lottery for development by way of derogation from legislation relating to the allocation of proceeds.</p>
<p>Is the Commission prepared to take the step of drafting a document setting out the technical conditions to put such a plan into practice and inviting all our Member States to take part in it and to make the legislative changes required?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)In the context of the discussions held with a view to increasing the volume and effectiveness of development aid and to preparing a European position for the September 2005 UN Summit, the Commission analysed the main options that exist in terms of innovative funding sources, with the aim of helping the Member States reach a consensus. At present, the Commission is also investigating the use of fines imposed by the EU on cartels that have breached competition rules as an alternative source of funding for development aid.</p>
<p>The proposals that have been welcomed by two groups of Member States are not related to the idea of a lottery.

<p>The idea put forward by the honourable Member is a good one, however, and worthy of serious consideration. The Member States’ national lotteries and the ministers responsible for them should be particularly involved in such considerations.</p>

<p>(FR)On Saturday, 8 October 2005 at 10.46 GMT an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale (according to a US geological study) occurred 95 km to the north of Islamabad in Pakistan, affecting Pakistan, the north of India and Afghanistan. The earthquake is one of the largest ever recorded in the region. The area affected measures approximately 28 000 sq. km<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>More than 1 196<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> after-shocks were then felt in Pakistan causing landslides.</p>
<p>The latest figures published on 8 November 2005 put the death toll in Pakistan at 73 276. A further 69 260 were injured in the disaster<a href="#defann_23_3" name="refann_23_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. More than two-thirds of the victims are in Pakistani Kashmir. There have also been 18 000 deaths in the North-West Frontier Province.

<p>The HIV/AIDS crisis has shown the urgent need to ensure that essential medicines are available at affordable prices. But today the medicines needed for second-line treatment for HIV/AIDS are up to 10 times more expensive than the medicines used as first treatment. While the 2001 WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was a vital step in increasing access to medicines, it has since then been systematically dismantled through bilateral trade agreements in which much higher levels of intellectual property protection are demanded than required by the WTO. Furthermore, the compulsory licence for export mechanism, adopted by the WTO, and which the EU is implementing now, does not respond to these needs, and the patent system does not meet the R&amp;D needs of the poor.</p>

<p>The agreement of 30 August 2003 between WTO member states aims to safeguard poor countries’ access to generic medicines.

<p>(EN)The Commission is committed to fighting for improved access to medicines for developing countries and continues to be very active on this front. The situation has much improved recently with regard to first-line anti-retrovirals for treating HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and special attention should now be paid, as pointed out by the honourable Members, to second-line treatment for HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>However, the issue of affordability of medicines does not depend on the patent system exclusively. Patent protection is only one factor among many others that can influence the price of medicines. The main factors that can contribute to a decrease of prices are increased transparency, competition and pricing adjusted to individual markets.</p>
<p>For second-line treatments for HIV/AIDS that have been put on the market only recently, this can be achieved in particular thanks to the granting of a voluntary or compulsory licence to a generic manufacturer with a view to allowing him to develop such a treatment. Moreover, for those countries without manufacturing capacities, the compulsory licence for export mechanism set up by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Decision of 30 August 2003 can be used.</p>
<p>Another way of making second-line treatments available at affordable prices consists in selling the original drug directly to the countries in need, at tiered price, i.e. at a lower price than that ruling on the European and other developed countries’ markets. In this respect, I draw the attention of the honourable Members to EC Regulation 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the EU of certain key medicines which precisely encourages the pharmaceutical industry to adopt a policy of tiered pricing in order to supply the developing world with medicines at the lowest possible price and on a sustainable basis.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully supportive of the 30 August Decision which sets up a balanced and flexible mechanism that provides for a workable framework to allow for exports of medicines produced under compulsory licence. The Commission considers that there is no need to review this mechanism at this stage. There is no evidence that it would contain cumbersome procedures and constraints. In order to evaluate the viability of the mechanism, it is necessary to make it workable and therefore to transpose it in national law. It is precisely what the EC is doing through the draft regulation on compulsory licensing which is currently under discussion between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Commission hopes that this new regulation will be adopted by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that there is no reason to delay further the transposition of the 30 August Decision into the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement that has been discussed between WTO Members for more than two years now. The 30 August Decision represents a delicate balance that was difficult to reach and it would be illusive to believe that re-opening discussions on substantive issues could lead to a different outcome from that obtained in August 2003. It is in the interest of the potential beneficiaries that the mechanism in question has to be a predictable, legally secure and sustainable solution that will enter into force as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Commission does not see the need for a special meeting at the WTO to examine whether the current WTO rules on patents and their flexibilities are sufficient to address the needs in developing countries with regard to public health. The TRIPs Agreement, including the Doha Declaration and the 30 August Decision, provides sufficient flexibilities to allow WTO members to protect public health and to promote access to medicines. What is needed is more dialogue and technical assistance to make developing countries fully aware of the existing flexibilities of the TRIPs Agreement. In this respect, the Commission can confirm that it is integrating in its Intellectual Property technical assistance programmes to developing countries sound legislative advice and clarification on how to give effect to the Doha Declaration and to the 30 August Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission’s objective for Hong Kong is to come to a result that is ambitious, balanced and pays special attention to the interests and needs of developing countries</p>
<p>The Commission submitted earlier this year to Parliament a report on developing countries’ access to our markets. Its findings can be summarized in one sentence: the European Union is giving developing countries a chance, through trade. In 2003, 40% of our imports came from developing countries. 63% of LDC<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> exports (excluding oil) to the Quad nations (US, EU, Canada, and Japan) went to the EU. This makes us, by far, the most open market for the world’s poorer countries. Our preferential regimes are well used and the proportion of goods entering the EU at zero tariff or at reduced rates is now 79%. And the LDCs benefit, of course, from the EU’s EBA<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> initiative.</p>
<p>Second, our approach is to maximise the development value of the key sectors of the negotiations: 70% of the development gains will come from the core negotiating area, through more market access and reduction in tariffs for agriculture, industrial products, and services liberalisation. Lets just take one example: manufacturing tariffs, the potential is huge, because 80% of developing countries exports are accounted for by industrial products, but also because South-South opening of markets can unlock major gains: 70% of all tariffs are paid by developing countries to other developing countries. This is why NAMA<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> is both an EU offensive agenda and a development agenda.</p>
<p>Third, there is also a more specific development agenda for which the EU intends to take the lead ahead of Hong Kong: ensuring that there is tariff and quota-free access to EU markets for everything, including agricultural products, for the Least Developed Countries; ensuring that action on the trade side is as development friendly as possible in particular for specific commodities such as cotton; providing the right degree of differentiation between developing countries in the implementation of trade rules; enshrining in the WTO<a href="#defann_26_4" name="refann_26_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>’s intellectual property agreements the conditions for a better access to cheap drugs against pandemics.</p>
<p>Finally adding to new opportunities to trade the proper build up in the capacity to trade, or Aid for Trade.

<p>At the beginning of September – following the failure of the October 2004 Lisbon ministerial meeting – the European Union and Mercosur resumed negotiations with a view to concluding an agreement on trade, cooperation and political dialogue between the two groupings. In spite of the trade-related conflicts of interest which have punctuated the negotiations, not-insignificant progress has been made in an attempt to overcome such disagreements and to reach a compromise in the course of 2006. Since the negotiations opened, Mercosur has announced that Venezuela is soon to become a new member. Notwithstanding the difficulties which this may cause, the strategic and energy dimension which such a development will bring to Mercosur is welcome, since it will facilitate the emergence of this particular regional grouping and help to consolidate the multipolar world which we advocate.</p>

<p>(EN)The recent EU-Mercosur ministerial meeting (2 September 2005) has provided a renewed impetus to the negotiations. Ministers reconfirmed our commitment to the negotiating process and agreed on a roadmap of further meetings. However, trade discussions remained quite general, pending Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Commission is determined to conclude negotiations as soon as it is technically and politically feasible. There might be a window of opportunity to make substantial progress in the first half of 2006, depending on the Hong Kong outcome. But substance should prevail over timing.</p>
<p>Venezuela has announced its intention to join Mercosur as full member in December 2005.</p>
<p>Full integration of Venezuela into Mercosur appears feasible provided that Venezuela leaves the Andean Community and adopts the acquis of Mercosur's trade norms. It is difficult to see how Venezuela could belong simultaneously to two different regions with different common legislation.</p>
<p>However, Venezuela has already expressed its intention to remain in the Andean Community. Mercosur officials claim that leaving the Andean Community is a pre-condition for full accession to Mercosur and are hinting at a long negotiating process, given the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>In view of this, a plausible option would be that Venezuela receives a privileged status as associate member of Mercosur, with little trade implications. If Venezuela is serious about full accession, the most likely scenario would be a declaratory decision in December 2005 with no immediate effects on trade, but setting a roadmap for accession. The subsequent negotiating process would be complex and would probably take some time.</p>

<p>(EN)Globalisation is a real opportunity for growth and higher living standards throughout the world. But effective and coherent global governance is needed to ensure that its benefits are distributed fairly. Steering a course between protectionism and unbridled opening-up of markets, the EU is seeking to promote a model that balances market forces with policies negotiated at multilateral level. The EU's Lisbon Strategy aims at reconciling economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.</p>
<p>The Commission has consistently argued that EU trade policy must have a social dimension and is actively contributing to the strengthening of the social dimension of globalisation both in Europe and elsewhere e.g. by including the promotion of employment, social cohesion and decent work in its external policies (e.g. in its political dialogue with third countries, EU bilateral agreements, trade related initiatives such as the GSP<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>+ scheme).</p>
<p>The Commission is also enhancing its cooperation with the ILO<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and other international institutions to foster multilateral governance fully supportive of social development.</p>
<p>The private sector can also make a positive contribution to these objectives: Corporate social responsibility is one of the responses to the imbalances resulting from the acceleration of the globalisation process. The Commission is committed to promote the further development of effective and transparent CSR<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> initiatives both in the EU and internationally.</p>
<p>The Textile sector in the EU has been deeply affected by the end of the MFA<a href="#defann_28_4" name="refann_28_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. Of course, the Commission is committed to ensuring that the EU textiles and clothing industry will be in a position to meet the challenges and difficulties facing it. Just as we are committed to promoting labour standards in developing countries. Several initiatives aimed at increasing the competitiveness and employment of the TC sector have been pursued in cooperation with EU member states and social partners, e.g. the setting up of a High Level Group which addressed issues such as research and innovation, competition rules and the fight against counterfeited products</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the importance of social dialogue as a driving force behind successful economic and social reforms and will continue to promote it. Social dialogue at European level has been a major instrument to address the key challenges of the sector, such as enhancing skills and qualifications, modernising work organisation, promoting equal opportunities and responsible restructuring.</p>
<p>A major social priority for the EU should be to help workers adapt to the more rapid economic change that a combination of deeper market integration and increased supply side investment will bring. When coping with structural change, anticipation and accompanying measures are fundamental. Workers need to be supported so that they can seize the opportunities offered by globalisation and cope with future changes. Adequate supportive policies are necessary in both the North and the South to anticipate the long term and mitigate the short term negative impacts on vulnerable regions, sectors and workers. Active labour market policies are needed to facilitate mobility, provide retraining and provide adequate safety nets; as well as policies promoting entrepreneurship and encouraging job creation through business start ups.</p>
<p>EU Structural Funds already play a major role in financing accompanying measures of restructuring processes, and an envisaged globalization adjustment fund would provide further support for the ongoing work on strategies to manage change. In addition, the Commission had set up a High-Level Forum on restructuring, gathering EU institutions, Members States, regional and local authorities, and social partners to discuss and exchange best practices and strategies on anticipating and managing change</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)There is no specific Community legislation on the use of guide dogs by blind people in the EU. This is a matter on which the Member States have exclusive competence and authority. Consequently, the Commission does not intend to adopt guidelines on the use of guide dogs for the blind in Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that the objective of the EU’s disability strategy is to ensure equality of opportunity. That strategy seeks to enable people with disabilities to exercise their rights in full. It is based on three pillars. First, legislation and measures are in place to combat discrimination and enable equal access to rights. Second, one of the aims is to eliminate physical obstacles preventing the exercise of these rights. And third, it is very important to ensure that disability issues are mainstreamed in the various European policies.</p>
<p>The Commission will shortly adopt a communication setting out the situation of people with disabilities in the enlarged EU based on information and analyses stemming in particular from the national action plans on employment and social inclusion, and drawing the attention of the various stakeholders to the positive outlook for disabled people resulting from the new Lisbon Strategy. The communication will also specify the priorities of the Commission’s 2<span class="sup">nd</span> Disability Action Plan 2006-2007.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the field of passenger transport, the Commission published a communication on 16 February 2005 seeking to strengthen passengers’ rights in the EU. That communication was accompanied by a proposal for a regulation concerning the rights and obligations of people with reduced mobility when travelling by air. The proposal established a list of assistance services that could be covered by the regulation. The list includes:</p>
<p>ground handling of assistance dogs where appropriate;</p>
<p>the carriage of assistance dogs in the cabin, subject to the national regulations in force, on flights lasting less than five hours.</p>
<p>That proposal was well received by Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism and by the Council. The Commission welcomed the recent contacts between the two co-legislators aimed at reaching an agreement on the text in first reading.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission’s 2004 proposal for a regulation on international rail passengers’ rights and obligations was designed to eliminate discrimination against passengers with reduced mobility and to ensure that such passengers are provided with the assistance they require before and during a journey.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0924"></a>

This new approach is based on the principle that the employer is responsible for prevention, information, training, consultation and the balanced participation of workers.</p>
<p>An analysis of the practical application of Framework Directive 89/391 and of its specific directives shows that they have been the motor for creating a culture of prevention in the European Union and have made it possible to rationalise and simplify national bodies of legislation on health and safety in the workplace.</p>
<p>However, one of the main, if not the most important reason for the constraints, problems and regulatory and administrative costs imposed on citizens and undertakings lies in the complexity and volume of national legislation which, in certain instances, transposes Community directives and which, in some areas, goes far beyond the requirements imposed at Community level.</p>
<p>Consequently, neither Parliament's recent resolution of 24 February 2005 on promoting health and safety in the workplace<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, nor the reports on the implementation of the framework directive drawn up by the Members State every five years, nor the assessment made by the Commission, contain any grounds for a revision of the fundamental principles established by the framework directive.</p>

<p>The Commission will nonetheless take any measures to improve the legislative framework that are shown to be necessary in the light of the ongoing evaluation. Among other things, it has embarked on an exercise to consult the social partners on simplification of the various national reports on the practical implementation of the health and safety at work directives.

<p>(EN)Ageing is one of Europe's biggest and most complex challenges. It is already transforming our society, the economy and the relationships between different generations.</p>
<p>Attracting older people to remain in, enter or re-enter the labour market has become a key objective of the re-launched Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs. The Commission is the driving force behind the re-launched Lisbon Strategy. The Commission, and the Union as a whole, has a particular role to play in supporting Member States' efforts by setting the right policy framework.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Green Paper "Confronting Demographic Change: A new solidarity between the generations" has launched a debate on a European level concerning the policies to address the demographic challenge. The aim of such policies must be to turn this challenge into an opportunity.</p>
<p>The Open Method of Co-ordination in the area of social protection is geared towards necessary reforms which would reflect the challenge of population ageing. Early retirement should no longer be a major way of handling problems during downsizing and corporate restructuring. Through such practices, Europe suffers a permanent loss of human capital and growth potential. This needs to be strongly discouraged by creating more flexible pathways to retirement. It is therefore encouraging that Member States are beginning to develop policies on ageing with a strong focus on pension reforms, as well as considering the health implications of an ageing society.</p>
<p>Improving the health of the population is crucial to develop a healthy and active society in which citizens are able and willing to continue working as they grow older. This is why the Lisbon Strategy, when stressing the need to attract more people into employment, underlines that “increasing Healthy Life Years will be a crucial factor in achieving this objective”<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Lifelong learning is also essential in encouraging and obtaining higher employment rates among older workers. Achieving major improvements in adult participation rates in continuing education and training is therefore one of the five European education performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>Active ageing is at the core of the lifecycle approach as adopted in the new integrated (employment) guidelines and requires the development of comprehensive strategies. Such strategies require promoting active ageing through the positive interaction of economic, social, health and employment policies and strong support from the social partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)Demographic trends play an important role in the European Union’s economic and social policy goals. The Commission helps the Member States to formulate policy responses that meet the challenges of demographic change, in particular via the open method of coordination. The latter is applied in the areas most affected by ageing, namely retirement, health and long-term care and employment. Increasing the number of people in employment is the best way of minimising the impact of ageing, and of guaranteeing the funding of social policies in the long term. This means that progress is needed in the field of equal opportunities (in order to increase the number of women in work), social inclusion (in order to promote the integration of marginalised groups) and active ageing (in order to encourage people to carry on working longer).</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Commission stressed the importance of demographic ageing in its Green Paper on demographic change, and it was bold enough to ask whether our only option was to resign ourselves to such change, or whether appropriate policy measures could reverse the trend. In particular, the Green Paper asked questions relating to the fertility rate, thus opening a debate that is all the more heated because it centres on private choices made by individuals and couples. The fertility rate in the European Union, which has fallen to below 1.5 children per womn in many Member States, is particularly low. There is every indication that this is a symptom of wider family malaise, and that it requires political intervention. It was for this reason that the Commission initiated a wide-ranging consultation by means of this Green Paper, and it hopes to be able to present the results of this consultation and proposals for action early next year.</p>
<p>One conclusion that is already emerging is that we must ensure that women do not have to choose between a career and a family. Measures that promote work-life balance and that make possible genuinely equal opportunities for men and women would appear to be the most conducive to increases in the fertility rate. There is in fact now a positive correlation between the number of women in work and the fertility rate, even though this figure was negative a few years ago. What this means is that the more that women can work, the more children they will have.</p>
<p>It would, however, be a mistake to think that any increase in the fertility rate, no matter how rapid and large, would remove the need for us to adapt our social policies to ageing. The main cause of ageing is the increase in life expectancy, and it will accelerate over the next few years as the large cohorts of the baby boom generation reach retirement age. Social and employment policies must be adapted in the face of this imminent and inevitable ageing. On the other hand, even a slight increase in the fertility rate, to a level significantly below the population replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, could check the anticipated population decline in the longer term and over several generations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0970"></a>

<p>(FR)The Green Paper highlighted issues raised by demographic change, with the aim of sparking a wide-ranging debate. The Commission wanted to give everyone the opportunity to voice their opinions during a consultation procedure, which was completed in mid-October 2005. Its task now is to analyse the many responses it received, which numbered over 220, and it intends to present both the results of this consultation and follow-up proposals in a new communication, which is due to be adopted in early 2006. This communication will also take into account the outcome of a series of studies funded under a pilot project called for by Parliament, and in particular by the honourable Member, Mr Walter.</p>
<p>The Commission is not merely sitting back and waiting for the results of this consultation, however. It is in fact already implementing or supporting a great many policies aimed at tackling the demographic challenge in the Member States, for example:</p>
<p>- the European Employment Strategy and EU education and training policy. These measures help generate more and better jobs, thus making it possible to offset to some extent the decline in the working-age population and the increasing demographic dependency ratio. Their aim is to tackle under-achievement in schools, to raise the level of education of young people and to promote life-long learning and active ageing in order to reverse the trend whereby people leave the labour force early.</p>
<p>- European cooperation with a view to modernising social welfare systems. The open method of coordination in the field of social welfare supports the efforts of Member States to adapt their retirement and health care systems to the needs of an ageing society. One priority in the field of social inclusion is to reduce the risk of poverty faced by children and families, in particular by one-parent families.</p>
<p>- promoting equal opportunities. It is still the case that too many women have to choose between a career and a family, and the choice they make often leads to a fall in the birth rate. This means that promoting equal opportunities by means of child care services and a better work-life balance is a key tool that can be used to reverse the trend of falling birth rates.</p>
<p>- the fight against discrimination. It is important to ensure that all the members of an ageing society can play an active role. The European Union works towards this goal by means of its legislative framework, which aims to eliminate discrimination, in particular age-based or disability-based, on the labour market.</p>
<p>- a common approach to immigration and integration, as outlined in a Green Paper presented by the Commission last year. An ageing Europe needs immigration, provided that it is accompanied by close integration into our societies and economies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0975"></a>

According to official figures, from the beginning of the year to date, industrial accidents have claimed 53 lives and left hundreds seriously injured. This is frequently attributable to the lack of accountability of employers and infringement of existing rules resulting from the more intensive pace of work and lax workplace procedures. This is compounded by the total absence of any official national health organisation representing works doctors and health and safety experts and the unsuitability and ineffectiveness of those bodies which are responsible for monitoring safety and health.</p>
<p>What steps is the Commission taking to ensure healthy and safe conditions at work and who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the rules by employers who are at the moment infringing them with impunity, showing a total disregard for anything other than lower labour costs and higher profit margins in the name of greater competitivity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concerns regarding the number of fatal accidents at work. As outlined in its communication ‘Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006’, the Commission’s aim is a continuing reduction in occupational accidents, both non-fatal and fatal. This strategy is based on consolidating a culture of risk prevention, on combining a variety of political instruments – legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives – and on building partnerships between all the players on the health and safety scene.</p>
<p>There is already a body of Community law on health and safety at work. In particular, this includes Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work, and the individual directives based thereon.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Community directives must be transposed by the Member States. Greece has notified the adoption of measures transposing Directive 89/391/EEC and individual directives on health and safety at work.</p>
<p>It is the task of the Member States, and in the case at hand of the Greek Labour Inspectorate, to ensure that the implementation of the national provisions transposing Community directives on the health and safety of workers at work is properly monitored and supervised.</p>
<p>Directive 89/391/EEC and the individual directives based thereon do not include any detailed provisions explicitly relating to the setting up of competent national authorities. It is the responsibility of each Member State to decide on the details of how its competent authority is to be set up, in such a way as to ensure that the correct implementation of national provisions is properly monitored and supervised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0891"></a>

Therefore, it would be premature at this stage to give an indication as to the further action taken by the Commission in this regard.

<p>(FR)The Commission has indeed initiated infringement proceedings against Hungary by sending it a letter dated 18 October 2005, asking it to submit its observations concerning the forms of registration tax collected on cars from other Member States. The Commission certainly shares the legitimate wish of the Member State to prevent outdated and more polluting cars from being imported into Hungary, thus harming its environment, but it considers that this objective must be pursued by respecting the rules of the Treaty and, more specifically, Article 90 thereof (as interpreted by the Court of Justice), which lays down that a Member State cannot tax vehicles from other Member States more heavily than vehicles circulating on its own territory. </p>
<p>The honourable Member's observation that the Commission wishes to propose a change in order to make it more profitable to import old technology, more polluting and less environmentally friendly passenger cars into Hungary is therefore incorrect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that it adopted a proposal on passenger car related taxes<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 5th July 2005, which includes a number of measures designed, on the one hand, to improve the functioning of the Internal Market by eliminating certain fiscal obstacles to the free movement of passenger cars in the EU and, on the other hand, to restructure the tax bases of car related taxes in order to include a carbon dioxide sensitive element.</p>
<p>Should this proposal be adopted by the Council, more carbon dioxide emitting passenger cars will be charged with higher car taxes. This is because each Member State will be obliged to differentiate the car taxes it applies, in order to take into account the carbon dioxide emissions, in terms of grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre run, emitted by each particular car. The situation will be that more carbon dioxide emitting cars will be charged with higher car taxes, and, therefore, a real incentive will be given to the consumer to opt for modern and more environmentally friendly cars instead of old and more polluting cars.</p>
<p>Subject to respecting the rules laid down in Article 90 of the Treaty, it will be for Hungary to fix the levels of car tax rates and the levels of tax differentiation, in order to discourage the introduction and/or use on its territory of old and more polluting passenger cars.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that this proposal is based on Article 93 of the EC Treaty and, therefore, it requires a unanimous decision for adoption. In the meantime, it has been sent for the opinion of Parliament. The ECON Committee has assumed the role of Chef de file.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)At the last meeting of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) Executive Board in September 2005, in which the Commission and the Presidency participated, the other Board Members (United States, Republic of Korea and Japan) stated that, taking into account the outcome of the Six Party Talks which ended on 19 September, an agreement was emerging between them to terminate the KEDO Nuclear Light Water Project (the LWR-project) when the current period of suspension ends on 30 November. KEDO as an organisation would be maintained for about a year, with a reduced size and mandate focussed only on an orderly winding up of the project.</p>
<p>This issue has an important nuclear non-proliferation aspect. The Commission has therefore asked the Council for a Decision to authorise the EU Executive Board Member to join the emerging consensus amongst the other Board Members on 21 November, the date on which KEDO’s Executive Board is likely to take a decision on the future of the LWR-project.</p>
<p>From contacts at the September KEDO Executive Board with the United States and the other Board Members and through bilateral contacts with participants in the Six Party Talks the Commission has been informed that the DPRK is fully aware about the possible termination of the LWR-project within the context of the Six Party Talks.</p>
<p>The final decision by the EU on whether to join the emerging consensus to terminate the LWR-project is under consideration in the Council. The Commission considers that it is essential to reach a clear decision on the future of KEDO at the Executive Board meeting on 21 November with the other Board Members. Above all the Commission considers it important that such a decision will be coherent with the long term objectives of the Six Party Talks.

<p>In the framework of this Communication, the Commission has already signed a contract with a consortium of external consultants in order to get an independent study, which will help the Commission to assess the state of play regarding maritime passenger’s rights. The cruise sector is covered by this study, and the terms of reference include specific points concerning persons’ with reduced mobility (PRM) rights. The final report is expected by autum 2006.</p>

<p>These measures, among some others which might be undertaken in 2006, will help the Commission to assess the best way of improving and guaranteeing the rights of passengers using maritime transport and the advisability of presenting, following an impact assessment, a legislative proposal.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission, on behalf of the European Communities, is fully committed to reach a balanced deal across all the different pillars of negotiations especially agriculture, NAMA<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and services negotiations.</p>
<p>On the honourable Member’s question on market prices, it is true that market access improvement would have an impact on domestic prices but this impact would come from any type of tariff cut. The CAP<a href="#defann_48_2" name="refann_48_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> reform has put the EU in a position to make a significant offer on market access, which nevertheless takes into account the need for specific provisions relating to sensitive products.</p>
<p>How to measure the likely implications of a particular offer on market access and its compatibility with CAP reform is a complex question which requires that a number of bench marks should be considered:</p>
<p>The increase in imports should not make the current market intervention arrangements unsustainable;</p>
<p>The outcome should not necessitate new market instruments or new budgetary expenditure;</p>
<p>The outcome should not result in price reductions on the domestic market which would result in a substantial income loss for the producers in question in excess of an equivalent outcome from a Uruguay Round approach. Therefore, potential income losses, both in sectors benefiting from direct payments and sectors not benefiting from them, have to be carefully considered;</p>
<p>The list of conditions spelled out for the market access offer needs to be seen as a whole. The treatment of sensitive products, including the Special Safeguard Clause for specific products, is a crucial element in that respect. Further disciplines from our trading partners in Domestic Support and Export Competition would also contribute in this respect by their positive impact on world market prices.</p>
<p>Against these benchmarks our current offer in Market Access remains within the mandate and delivers substantial improvements in market access as required by the Framework Agreement. But it is also clear that the current offer on tariff cuts is at the limit of what the Commission can do within its mandate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is devoting close attention to the situation of human rights in Tunisia and is closely following developments through all the existing channels, notably the EC Delegation in Tunis.</p>
<p>The visit of the Commissioner in charge of External Relations to Tunisia last month (12-13 October 2005) was largely focused on questions related to democracy and human rights. The Commissioner expressed her concerns about the deterioration in the respect for human rights and the independence of the judiciary and strongly encouraged all her interlocutors, including the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take concrete measures to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement is indeed an important basis to intervene in this regard. However, the Commission believes that this article should serve as a tool to promote positive engagement with our partners in the area of human rights and democratisation. It is the Commission’s view that the possibility of negative measures under EU agreements should be considered only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Moreover, we now have a new and more effective framework to tackle human rights questions: the neighbourhood policy. It is the Commission’s firm intention, shared with the Council, to use the neighbourhood instruments as a lever in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>The global and joint Action Plan introduces a new element – conditionality. If Tunisia wants to deepen its relations with the EU and benefit from our financial assistance, it will have to implement it in all its components, including those aspects linked to democracy, governance and human rights.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Action plan provides for setting up in the near future a sub-committee on democracy and human rights, where concrete issues can be discussed and progress regularly assessed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0942"></a>

Parliament is examining the Commission's proposal for the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7), <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0119">COM(2005)0119</a> final.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that, given the paucity of R&amp;D dedicated to health issues affecting the populations of developing countries, increased attention and investment are urgently needed, and will it facilitate discussions between DG Development and DG Research so that the FP7 budget for R&amp;D on HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB (poverty diseases) is increased, a specific budgetary head is included in the FP7 for neglected diseases that affect only developing countries and new mechanisms are introduced to define needs-driven R&amp;D and to ensure long-term and sustainable funding?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Research Framework programmes (FP) 4 to 6 have allowed important investments in research on “neglected communicable diseases” in the past decade through their international scientific cooperation activities. Under the current international cooperation programme of FP6, there are specific calls on knowledge and technologies to improve control of neglected communicable diseases, focusing on (1) vector-borne diseases (e.g. Chagas disease and sleeping sickness, Dengue, haemorrhagic fevers, schistosomiasis, filiariasis and leishmaniasis), (2) neglected specific parasitic, bacterial and viral infections, and (3) major childhood infections. Research on malaria, HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and tuberculosis receives substantial support through the thematic priority on poverty related diseases in the priority on life sciences.</p>
<p>In the area of neglected communicable diseases there are currently 27 active projects with clusters in the area of Leishmaniasis (6 projects), Trypanosomiasis (5), Schistosomiasis (5 projects), and river blindness (3). More projects are expected from this year’s call, where 68 submitted proposals on neglected diseases are just now being evaluated by independent international experts. In addition, there are a range of health systems research projects, addressing crucial preconditions for the effective control of neglected communicable diseases such as accessibility, affordability and quality of health care.</p>
<p>The projects the Commission is funding or will fund this year represent a substantial contribution towards broader international efforts in this area and we would like to stress the fact that we are not only supporting high quality research but also high-quality, long-term research partnerships with developing countries, the majority belonging to the ACP regions. This collaboration through programmes such as European and Developing Countries trials Partnership contributes substantially to enhance the research capacities to design and implement new control strategies.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware and most thankful to Parliament for its support to further strengthen our collaborative research for the control of these neglected diseases. The specific research programme proposals, presented by the Commission on 21 September 2005, emphasize the needs for further research in support of health, control and surveillance of poverty related and neglected communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Coming to the last point of the question about funding, it has to be considered that there is not yet an agreement on the EU’s financial perspectives. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to comment on financial commitments at this stage. However, within the limits of the final budgetary allocation for EU research, it will take the issues of controlling poverty related and neglected diseases as well as the development of new mechanisms for needs-driven research very seriously. It also appreciates very much the support of Parliament regarding the Commission’s proposal to double the EU research funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Sanitary measures in relation to trade in beef and beef products must respect the provisions of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement) of the World Trade Organisation. This Agreement does not permit Members to insist, as a general rule, that the exact same rules apply to imports as to domestic products. Instead, the Agreement provides that Members shall accept measures of other Members as equivalent, even if these measures differ from their own, if it can be demonstrated that they achieve the appropriate level of protection. This approach has its merits as otherwise trade would not take place in the absence of harmonised international standards.</p>
<p>The requirements in relation to imports to the EU from third countries of beef and beef products are laid down in Community legislation. These requirements are tailored to the individual animal and public health circumstances in the country of export. However, as a general rule, the requirements are not more favourable, or less favourable, than the requirements which apply to beef and beef products produced within the EU. This ensures that public and animal health protection is not compromised. It also ensures that trade can take place under rules which are science-based, transparent and non-discriminatory. There are a range of checks in place, at both Community and Member State level, to ensure that these requirements are met. These include checks on all such imports at the point of entry to the EU.</p>
<p>In many cases the circumstances of individual third countries require additional measures. For example, imports from countries such as Argentina and Brazil must comply with special conditions to take account of their status in relation to foot and mouth disease. These additional measures are necessary to ensure that there are no unacceptable risks to public and animal health in the EU and are compatible with the requirements of the SPS Agreement.</p>
<p>Insofar as these veterinary and hygiene requirements are concerned, the Commission takes care to ensure that the measures in place in the country of export meet the relevant import requirements, including through regular on-the-ground inspections. Corrective measures are demanded where there is evidence of non-compliance or where weaknesses in implementation are noted. The Commission also requires the submission and approval of monitoring plans for the presence of certain substances, such as contaminants and veterinary medicines, which are banned or controlled in the Community. These plans are supplemented by checks in the Member States on imported products and periodic inspections in the main countries of export. The Commission does not allow the use of growth promoters in animals destined for export to the EU and has taken the necessary corrective measures, including a ban on imports, where there has been evidence of non-respect of this requirement. The Commission agrees that this is a vital requirement in order to ensure consumer protection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The October meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers saw various countries voicing their opposition to the Commission’s intention to open a zero-rated olive oil import quota to combat rising market prices apparently caused by a sharp fall in production.</p>
<p>Producers are worried that this measure may be being adopted prematurely, before there are any exact production figures for the year which has just begun. Opening a quota could lead to a slump which cannot be quantified a priori, due to the fragility of the market, but which would lead to significant income loss to producers. Commissioner Fischer-Boel promised the Council that she would not take a final decision until she had received the opinion of the Olive Oil Consultative Committee at the meeting scheduled for 7 November. Given that following the uncoupling of aid introduced into the reform of the sector, there could be a significant degree of uncertainty at the beginning of the year with regard to the actual figures for the Community harvest, does the Commission not think that it should wait even longer before adopting any decision, in the hope of securing a more reliable picture of the market situation?</p>

These roadworks will cause delays until the end of spring 2006. Although the work is urgently needed, mayors in the Aspe Valley have condemned the fact that there is no overall plan to improve the route once and for all. They have also condemned the adverse effects of the traffic delays both on tourism and on the transport of goods.

Mindful of the Commission’s concern about communications across the Pyrenees, and of the outcome of the Spanish-French Summit of 17 October 2005 – in particular as regards the programming of work on connections across the Pyrenees – what steps is the Commission taking to avoid a repeat of the events of last winter, and to uphold the principles of the free movement of people and goods across the Somport pass between France and Spain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The need for the repairs arose following a landslide in winter 2004-2005, and they were completed earlier than originally planned. Lorries weighing over 3.5 tonnes were allowed to access the Somport tunnel via national highway 134 again in June 2005.</p>
<p>France plans to carry out repairs on the retaining walls in early 2006, as part of structural repair work on this stretch of road. This work is essential for traffic safety in the medium term. It will entail only certain temporary restrictions (contraflow systems), and will not result in any closure of the road to heavy goods vehicles. The French government is in contact with the Spanish government on this matter.</p>

It is in close contact with the relevant national authorities, who, with Community support, have increased levels of surveillance to detect any outbreaks of the disease in the EU.</p>
<p>In agreement with the Member States, the Commission has introduced a series of measures to increase surveillance and ensure early detection of any occurrence of the disease in the EU in domestic poultry and in other birds including migratory birds and to minimise the risk of contact between wild birds and domestic poultry. These measures include a temporary ban on the use of water birds as decoys during bird hunting in higher risk areas. Nevertheless exceptions may be considered, under the strict supervision of the competent authorities, for the attraction of wild birds for sampling in the framework of surveillance programmes.</p>

<p>(EN)The main objective of the food labelling legislation in the EU is to provide consumers with factual information regarding the characteristics of foodstuffs, thus enabling them to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>In that respect, origin is mandatory information where it is clearly connected with one or more characteristics of a foodstuff, as is the case for non-processed fresh products, wine, or products with protected appellation of origin.</p>
<p>Origin labelling is also mandatory where failure to do so might mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the foodstuff, for instance where its name includes a geographical reference.</p>
<p>Although compulsory animal welfare and environmental protection standards in the EU are among the strictest in the world origin labelling in itself would not necessarily provide the consumer with very clear information as regards the actual standards of animal welfare or environmental protection under which such foodstuffs have been produced. For instance with respect to the welfare of farmed animals minimum rules are laid down in Community legislation, and some voluntary labelling schemes exist for products produced under higher standards.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently considering possible initiatives to more fully inform consumers of the conditions under which foodstuffs are produced, and investigating strategies such as labelling to facilitate a more informed purchasing choice. This will also be considered in the context of the future review of the food labelling legislation.</p>
<p>A recent Eurobarometer survey supports the Commission’s efforts to explore more specific labelling measures with respect to the ways animals are farmed. This is why the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals – which will be adopted by the Commission in December 2005 – will also consider this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0961"></a>

<p>There are currently food items on sale (such as chocolate eggs, breakfast cereals, biscuits or crisps) which contain toys. This marketing trick aimed at children is of course intended to influence their choice of product. Small children, unlike adults, cannot understand the difference between advertisements and genuine information, and find it difficult to distinguish what is edible and what is not when it is all in the same packaging. Small children may believe that the toy is also edible. This can lead, and has led, to accidents involving breathing difficulties and suffocation. Food items containing toys are forbidden in the USA and Australia for safety reasons. In view of the above, is the Commission proposing to legislate in this area?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is very committed to the objective of ensuring protection of children who are a main target of the European product safety policy. Accordingly, the possible risk related to the sale of small toys with food is an issue that the Commission is monitoring closely.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Commission would like to invite the honourable Member to refer to its position expressed in the replies given to several previous parliamentary questions on the same topic<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A common high level of safety for toys, including in particular small toys included in food, is guaranteed by Directive 88/378/EEC on the Safety of Toys and by the European standard for toys EN-71.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that substantial amendments to the existing legislation need to be justified by scientific evidence. The honourable Member must be aware of a study carried out for Parliament in 2003 which found that although causal link between eating the food product and a subsequent incident is not proven, the risk associated with food products containing inedibles are demonstrably low (RPA 2003).</p>
<p>The Commission is currently discussing the revision of Directive 88/378/EEC in the framework of the Expert Group on the Safety of Toys with the Member States, the associations of consumers and industry as well as with the standardisation organisations. The issue of toys contained in foodstuff is open for discussion in this context.</p>
<p>The impact assessment study addressing the impacts of the revision of Directive 88/378/EEC did not result in new scientific based elements demonstrating a need to address the question of toys in food by specific provisions in the Directive (see http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/toys/index_en.htm). However, the Commission will take all pertinent information into account to assess if a reinforcement of measures and standards is necessary to reduce potential risks linked to the availability of toys in food.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The starting points taken by both the Commissioner and the European Union's main trading partners in these closing stages of the negotiations are too extreme.

Does the proposal that this aid be reduced by 70% imply that the EU has a margin for manoeuvre equal to that percentage, or is the margin higher?

<p>(EN)In the Doha Round it is the ambitious CAP<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>-reform of 2003 which constitute the Commission’s negotiating brief. It is the reform process of CAP which is determining the negotiating margin of the EC in the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council also concluded (in June 2003) that the margin of manoeuvre provided by the CAP Reform of 2003 can only be used in the Doha negotiations on “condition of equivalent agricultural concessions from WTO<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> partners”.</p>
<p>On market access, the Commission is guided by the Council’s endorsement of the 2004 July Framework Agreement and its call for “substantial new market access” in agriculture. Consequently, the recent EU offer provides substantial new market access in agriculture, which is a crucial component of the development goals expressed by the Council, but does not jeopardize the EU farming sector and does not go beyond our margin of maneuver in terms of tariff reduction for any products.</p>
<p>On the issue of sensitive products, the framework agreement clearly provides that we have to negotiate a number of sensitive products and not to negotiate what products will enter in the sensitive products category. The actual choice of sensitive products by the EU will be the subject of in depth discussions with the Member States at the appropriate moment.</p>
<p>On domestic support, the figures that the EC has recently put on the table (eg. AMS -70%, de minimis -80%, overall cut -70%) are in line with the CAP reform and with the Council mandate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Greek fisheries sector, which consists mainly of small and medium-sized fleets, is facing a major crisis as a result of the reduction in the size of fishing grounds and failure to exploit them rationally because of inefficient or illegal fishing methods. This is compounded by the lack of structured markets and the inexistence of cooperatives to put paid to the irresponsible actions of intermediaries or retailers and ensure that fish is actually affordable for the average family.</p>
<p>Will the Commission seek to obtain easier credit facilities for fishing fleets and funding for infrastructures with a view to overcoming the crisis and attracting young people to the fisheries sector? Will it provide assistance for the setting up and running of cooperatives and protect consumers by means of catch certification from fraudulent practices and profiteering on the part of intermediaries which depress producer prices and inflate consumer prices?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Excess of capacity and fishing effort are present in many fisheries, thus preventing fishing activities from being economically viable. This situation is now aggravated by the current price of oil products. However, the sustainable exploitation of fisheries is a necessary condition for the economic viability of fishing companies.</p>
<p>In order to help the sector overcome the current economic crisis, the Commission is preparing a communication exploring the possible courses of action in different areas. Among them there is the organisation and functioning of the market, which should be improved so that fishermen can get a better value for their products. In relation to this, the promotion of eco-labelling initiatives will be promoted by the Commission.</p>
<p>In relation to the funding for infrastructures, market initiatives and producer organizations, these are already possible under the current FIFG<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> rules.</p>
<p>This will be reconducted and even extended under the European Fisheries Fund proposal for the next programming period where support for measures to promote fish products, quality policy and certification will be provided.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the view that measures to attract young people to joint the profession have to be promoted, for this reason, under the FIFG, specific aid measures are provided to help young fishermen acquire their first fishing boat. Under the future Fund, it is intended to extend this possibility further as well as put more emphasis on their training and the upgrading of professional skills.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, has included education among the instruments for implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, its objectives for 2010 being effective and mutually compatible education systems, mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications, encouragement of mobility and lifelong education opportunities for all ages. However, the Commission’s most recent report (key figures for education in Europe - 2005) expresses concern regarding the effectiveness of education systems in the EU, pointing to major disparities regarding student numbers as a percentage of total population, the sharp drop in numbers receiving education after the age of 19, large regional variations in this area and differences in the level of education expenditure in the various Member States. In addition, shortcomings are detected (to varying extents) in all the education systems, with the result that pupils have to resort to private tuition.</p>
<p>Will the Commission take action in response to this? Will it redefine European criteria for making qualitative and quantitative assessments on the basis of specific education objectives and reporting on its findings, as it has done in the past?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The “Education and Training 2010” Work Programme is the policy tool to support increased cooperation among Member States to improve the performance and equity of their education systems. The aim is also to implement coherent and comprehensive strategies for lifelong learning, ensuring access for all, and in particular the most disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Annual Report provides information on the follow-up of the 29 indicators selected for monitoring the Work Programme. In addition to this Report, the joint Council/Commission biennial reporting on the implementation of the Work Programme allows the Commission and the Council to take stock of progress achieved. The Commission has just adopted its contribution to the 2006 Joint Report (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0549">COM (2005)549</a>), based on Member States’ national reports. It underlines that despite important efforts made by all countries in key areas of the Work Programme, there is indeed too little progress against those European benchmarks fixed for improving young people’s qualifications and competences, and adult participation in lifelong learning. The rate of early school leavers in the Union also remains too high. However, we have no evidence that this situation has led directly to a higher uptake of private education.</p>
<p>In its Communication, the Commission stresses the need to accelerate the pace of reforms and to make sure that those reforms support both the efficiency and equity objectives of education and training systems. To help Member States in their reform efforts, the Commission is supporting peer learning activities among Member States. Peer learning activities aim to foster the exchange of good policy practices and to support progress towards the objectives set for 2010, in particular in relation to the five benchmarks adopted by the Education Council in 2003. The responsibility for implementing the necessary reforms to change the situation is the responsibility of each Member State.</p>
<p>Crucial areas in need of reform are already covered by four of the existing European benchmarks, namely the ones on early school leavers, on completion of upper secondary education, on reading literacy and participation in lifelong learning, and on adult participation in lifelong learning. Therefore, the Commission does not consider, at this stage, proposing additional European benchmarks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
