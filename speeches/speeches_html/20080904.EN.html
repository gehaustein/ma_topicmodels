Our citizens are exposed to pollution in various forms, more often than not as a combination of different factors, and this applies whether you live in town or in the countryside, by the sea or in the mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore anything but a coincidence that, according to the latest statistics put out by Eurostat, six out of every ten Europeans believe it highly or relatively likely that environmental pollution is affecting their health and also, and this is important, that the European Union is not sufficiently active in this area, which is the whole object of our debate this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to thank my colleagues and most particularly the shadow rapporteurs of this report, Mrs Ferreira, Professor Trakatellis, Mrs Breyer, Mrs Belohorská and Mrs de Brún, for the excellent collaboration that we have maintained since the start of this particular project, which dates back to 2003. Indeed it was in 2003 that the European Commission set the ball rolling with what was then the SCALE initiative, which focused on children’s health, followed the year after with the launching of an Action Plan that is due to run until 2010. This is an initiative that we consider to be inadequate in scope in that at its February 2005 sitting Parliament adopted a resolution that was fairly critical, it has to be said, based on the simple assessment that an action plan, in essence, cannot set itself the sole objective of producing more data and conducting more research, even if these are of an essential nature. We were therefore disappointed, and all the more since one Member State after another, notably France with its national health and environment plan along with many of the German Länder, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and others, went on to set up ambitious national plans of their own,</p>
<p class="contents">Three years later how far have we got in reducing illnesses that can be attributed to the impact of pollution? At Community level not very far, it seems to me, and I therefore now want to present a proper mid-term review of the situation as it stands. Certainly the European Union, as we have said over and over again, can pride itself on having achieved many successes in combating various forms of pollution. While it is impossible to list them all, they include the recent legislation on ambient air quality – which owes much to your vigorous efforts, Commissioner – the pesticides package, which is about to be completed, and of course the REACH initiative, which places controls on more than 10 000 chemical substances and proposes to replace those that are causing the most problems. I would also like to mention another important aspect, namely the funding provided by the Commission over the last three years for more than 38 projects devoted to health and the environment as part of the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which comes to an estimated total of more than EUR 200 million. In other respects, and given the difficulty of assessing the impact of this plan, which has so far failed to live up to its name, I would say that our overall impression is somewhat mixed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our draft resolution today therefore centres on the need to restore the precautionary principle, which I know is also held dear by the Secretary of State. Like her, I sincerely believe that we need to redeem and revive this principle, which as I have said before is that of action rather than abstention, and ensure that it is applied as part of Community policy, as provided for in Article 174(2) of our Treaty and now established as an ongoing precedent by the Court of Justice. Still on this subject I believe that it is important that we should seek to shift the burden of proof for all product legislation – and this is what we are providing for in point 13 of our resolution – because it is only right, and indeed it is obvious, that the producers and importers should be responsible for demonstrating that a product is harmless. I would add that, wrongly perhaps, this is what most consumers already believe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second subject of concern, and of no less importance, is that which is covered in points 23 to 25, namely the issue of climate change. We have examined this crucial question in close collaboration with experts from the WHO. The phenomenon that is most frequently depicted by these experts is that of an increased intensity and frequency of heat waves. How can we forget that after the summer 2003 heat wave more than 70 000 additional deaths were recorded in some ten European countries? It appears to us that a system of preventive measures – reduced exposure to heat, an early warning system and of course aid for the elderly – needs to be put in place here. I would also point out that the increase in temperature levels brings with it the appearance of certain viruses, such as the chikungunya virus that struck Italy in 2007, and that while this was anything but an epiphenomenon, at least according to the experts, it was perhaps an early warning sign of numerous pandemics in Europe. Obviously this also calls for a response that is appropriate to the potential scale of the problem, and at the very least a proper system of coordination between the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm and the various European capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to round up my presentation by referring to what has, for the health sector, been the soap opera, the saga of summer 2008, one that has been running everywhere in many countries – in France, Belgium and others besides – and here I am talking about the flood of information, articles and studies, most of them contradictory, on the health risks, proven or otherwise, of mobile telephone devices, and particularly of the threat they pose to the most vulnerable groups, especially children. Here the highly, if not to say excessively, media-conscious David Servan-Schreiber was not the first to set the alarm bells ringing. What we are stating in paragraphs 21 and 22 of our resolution is simple: all these various studies tend to show that electromagnetic fields have an impact on human health; moreover, exposure limits, it has to be recalled, have not been amended since 1999 and therefore remain the official European Union standard, while at the same time we have a complete lack of consensus among researchers as to whether or not GSM waves pose health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">This scientific uncertainty is likely to run and run. The time will come when the policy-makers have to take a decision and that is what we are doing in the resolution that is being presented today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Environment Ministers had an opportunity to deal with this issue last December and the Council is now attaching increasing importance to this matter. Different pathologies are involved here, and while these are numerous, the facts and the links between pollution and health have still not been properly established. What we are referring to here are respiratory diseases, asthma, allergies, cancer and endocrine disruptors, especially those that affect the most vulnerable sections of the population, as Mrs Ries has already pointed out, including children, pregnant women, the elderly and the disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s new strategy to promote sustainable development, as adopted by our heads of state or government in June 2006, quite rightly includes public health as one of the key challenges we face, the aim being to promote health without discrimination and to improve protection against the health risks that are now being posed, and all this has to be achieved – and I will come back to this – by means of robust preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several ways of improving the current situation, and all have been mentioned. There is better cooperation between the health sector and the environment sector, which unfortunately sometimes tend to develop in separate directions. There is the need to improve the quality of the environment, and that is what we are doing, especially with our work on the IPPC Directive and the proposal for a directive on soil quality, which we shall speak about presently, as well as the need currently facing us to improve Community expertise in this area. There is the work that we are all doing together at international level, and especially within the World Health Organisation. Finally, there is the objective that we are pursuing in a very hands-on way, which is to improve the manner in which environment is incorporated into every relevant policy, plan and programme, and especially in the course of the health and environment programme that is to run from 2004 to 2010. In short, it is important to bring this mid-term review to a successful conclusion so as to ensure that the actions taken are as effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Ries, I in turn would like to stress the need for preventive measures in all the different fields of action, and in all the points that have been mentioned in your work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council in its conclusions of last December, just like Parliament today, takes the view that action is needed as soon as possible. We have to act quickly and we have to act ahead of events. We need to act according to the principles of prevention and according to the principles of precaution, which certainly means developing new tools capable of anticipating and analysing potential threats as soon as they appear or as soon as any suspicion arises, and then being able to view these various problems against a different background, such as that of climate change or biosecurity, for example, which are both areas that are connected with human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This review is a report on the implementation of the Action Plan to date.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the European Parliament’s response to this mid-term review has been positive and that, in common with the Commission, it considers the mutual interaction between the environment and health to be very important. I am particularly happy that the French Presidency, both today and via the Minister on previous occasions, has shown its full support for this subject, which is so important to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the aim of the European Action Plan for the relationship between the environment and health is to improve the provision of information, and to encourage research on the environment and human health, in order to better understand the threats and risk factors posed to human health by the environment. Political leaders at European and national level will thus be able to create more effective legislation and measures to protect the health of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Plan covers 13 specific courses of action for the 2004-2010 period. It was drawn up after extensive consultation with experts and bodies working in the European environmental, health and research sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Action Plan, emphasis is laid on the vital importance of close cooperation between environmental, health and research departments, at both national and European level. This cooperation is key in dealing in the best possible way with the mutual impact that the environment and health have on each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Four years after the adoption of the Action Plan I am happy to report that this close cooperation between the various services has now been consolidated. This is clearly a very positive development, according to last year’s mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a specific example. The Member States are now working together to coordinate a European approach to the issue of human biomonitoring. This involves the ministries of research, health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to add that, after the approval of last year’s progress report, the Commission also undertook other important activities, especially regarding human biomonitoring, the relationship between climate change and health, air quality in indoor areas, research on the environment, and health and electromagnetic fields. I am therefore glad that these issues are included in the European Parliament’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly elaborate on the new developments. The Commission is now adopting a broader approach to the issue of air quality in indoor areas. This approach also corresponds to the European Parliament’s 2005 resolution. Many activities have been undertaken that go beyond the specific targets in the Action Plan. For instance, new research projects have been funded by the Commission, a working group of experts has been set up and a Green Paper on tobacco smoke and scientific opinions have been approved. What still remains to be decided is the legal means to deal with the issue of air in indoor areas in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to human biomonitoring, the Commission regrets that the proposal submitted by the consortium of 24 Member States was not judged suitable for funding on the basis of the 7th Framework Programme. In any case, a new call will be published this month to submit proposals on human biomonitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Commission will continue preparatory work on the pilot project within the framework of an ERA-NET network and within the framework of an administrative arrangement with the Joint Research Centre in Ispra in close collaboration with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As for electromagnetic fields, the Commission is carrying out continuous monitoring of scientific developments, through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and through the ΜΝΤ network for electromagnetic fields, a project in the 6th Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is promoting research in the most important subject areas in order to determine whether the exposure limit values laid down in the Council’s recommendation should be revised. The Commission recently asked each Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to reconsider its opinion on the basis of the most recent data and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between climate change and health is clearly an issue of growing importance, according to the mid-term review. The relationship will be dealt with in the White Paper on adaptation to climate change, due to be adopted very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments show that the Commission places great importance on an even higher level of incorporation of the health dimension into European environmental policy. Recent legislation, such as that on chemicals, REACH, and the new directive on ambient air quality, reinforce environmental and health protection and are examples of a mutually beneficial way of dealing with the environment and health in the interests of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, for her report, her excellent work and the enormous interest she has shown in the issue of the relationship between the environment and health. I should also like to reiterate the firm intention of the Commission to continue its efforts on the Environment and Health Action Plan. The Commission is determined to shape effective environmental legislation and ensure the correct implementation of existing legislation in order to protect both the environment and the health of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission will play an active role in preparations for the Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health, scheduled to be held in July 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would of course also like to congratulate Mrs Ries for the excellent work that she has carried out in dealing with an issue that is of special importance and sensitivity for our citizens. Hippocrates once said that to study medicine you have to study the climate. While we can certainly recognise the efforts that the European Commission has made since the launch of the Environment and Health Action Plan in 2004, it is a matter of some regret that this initiative is not based on a genuine prevention policy that is aimed at reducing diseases linked to environmental factors and one that pursues a clear and properly costed objective. Ten years ago, when climate change was being debated, the health risks as such were never mentioned. Today the frequent occurrence of heat waves, floods, wildfires and natural disasters of all kinds within the European Union is altering the appearance of those illnesses that are caused by bacteria and viruses and transmitted by some insects. We therefore have to acquire a better understanding of the consequences that all this may have for human health, and especially that of the most vulnerable members of society, so that we become better able to manage the risks involved. Where the main objective of the 2008-2013 health programme is to act upon the factors that traditionally determine health, namely diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and the use of drugs, the present 2004-2010 Action Plan is to focus on certain new health challenges and address the determining environmental factors that affect human health. I am also thinking about air quality, electromagnetic waves – a subject that has already been touched on – worrying nanoparticles, as we have seen in the REACH programme, substances that are classed as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, endocrine disruptors and all the health risks posed by climate change, and I have already spoken about these. I also wish to point out that while respiratory illnesses rank second as a cause of death and in terms of incidence, prevalence and cost, within the EU they constitute the main cause of death among children under the age of five and are continuing to progress on account of indoor and outdoor air pollution in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the subject of urban environmental health, and particularly the quality of indoor air, the Commission should do more to combat domestic pollution, given that Europeans spend on average 90% of their time inside buildings. We know that this subject, this link between environment and health, is a particularly important and sensitive issue and we need to find a proper response to it as soon as possible for our citizens’ sake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a determination that I share, because the link between environment and health, which is now widely recognised, warrants a response in the shape of our political actions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to move forward so as to update our knowledge in this area and, more especially, to implement actions designed to limit the negative impact of our environment on human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The different subject areas have been clearly identified and are covered in the Action Plan. It has been necessary not only to take account of the effects of climate change and to devise methods of risk assessment but also to discuss other factors such as electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also gratified to see that the report contains a reference to the 2007 document produced by the European Environment Agency showing that atmospheric pollutants, and particularly those associated with fine particles and ground-level ozone, represent a considerable threat to the proper development of children and are reducing life expectancy in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret that the problems associated with health in the work environment have not been included in the text. It should be remembered that millions of people now suffer from illnesses that are linked to their working environment and whose origins are many and varied: stress, work intensity, various pollutants, musculoskeletal disorders associated with poor workplace ergonomics and so on. I hope that this issue will be considered seriously by other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Ries has said, the biggest problem is also that we are falling behind. The Commission, it seems to me, has not been sufficiently active in honouring the commitments that it set itself. Here I would refer, for example, to the issue of nanoparticles, a subject that is currently the focus of numerous reports and one that is raising many questions.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I read in the Commission’s 2007 communication on the objectives for 2004-2006 that the intention is to examine the possible effects of nanoparticles on health and the environment. Following that, for the 2007-2010 period there is provision for research into the potential risk that nanoparticles pose for human health. This means three years to look into a subject and another three years to carry out studies. It seems to me that we could be more efficient than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Doubtless there are reasons for this inadequate approach: lack of human resources and lack of financial means. However, what kind of credibility can the EU expect if it fails to keep to its own commitments? We know that on these issues Europeans can recognise the valued added of the European dimension. Let us therefore not disappoint them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish with a question that is directed at the Council and at the Commission: you referred, Commissioner, to cooperation between the different services and between the research teams, which is a good thing. Is there also coordination between the different national environmental-health plans drawn up at government level and the European Action Plan? Finally, Madam Minister, when you take the floor again, perhaps you can tell us whether France, for example, has linked its efforts to those that it has been making under the environmental Grenelle? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This action plan is exactly this kind of area. I would like to raise a few things which our rapporteur Mrs Ries addresses in her report. Her criticism of the lack of quantified objectives and indicators is very serious. We must add to the action plan. The criticism from Mrs Ries and several other Members of the fact that there are insufficient precautionary measures is serious. It is directed at this material and we must take it into account in our ongoing work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to highlight three areas: weak groups, endemic disease and the link between climate and health. We must become much better at seeing the differences in treatment and medication of adults and children, and women and men. It is a scandal that this is still not self-evident and has not already been implemented in medical research and treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The work which has started on patient mobility in the internal market is incredibly important to different patient groups, e.g. those with neck injuries, where different standards of treatment are found in different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the focus of the French Presidency on Alzheimer’s disease, one of our major endemic diseases, but we also need a coordinated approach for diabetes, asthma and rheumatism, to name but a few examples. This is also the case for working environment-related injuries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now witnessing a trend in Europe and worldwide of more pandemics and the greater spreading of viruses, bacteria and parasites in a manner which has not been seen in a very long time. Much of this is naturally related to climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Antibiotic-resistant bacteria mean medicines and treatments are not working and this is one of our most urgent health problems. It is a shame that the development of new antibiotics has largely ground to a halt in the major pharmaceutical companies. I hope that the Presidency and the Commission will tackle this very serious and major problem as soon as possible!</p>
<p class="contents">We also need an analysis of different climate change scenarios. What effect would a global increase in temperature of two degrees, four degrees or even more have on health in Europe? No such material is available today. If we are to be able to make concrete and good decisions on the climate change package, we also need reliable material on the various climate scenarios we will have to cope with in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the very appropriate measures to improve the natural environment and combat climate change require additional financial resources. This puts public authorities and economic entities in the new Member States in a particularly difficult situation. The new Member States are obviously focusing mainly on catching up with the more developed countries of the European Union in terms of development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is endeavouring to take the lead, for example as regards limiting carbon dioxide emissions, but the Commission allocated the limits without taking account of how much individual Member States had to make up in terms of development. As a result, my country, Poland, was awarded a lower limit of carbon dioxide emissions. This led to electricity prices rising immediately by between 10 and 20 per cent. I dread to think how far electricity prices will rise after 2013, when power stations will have to purchase all their emissions limits on the open market. In this way, a sensible measure to limit carbon dioxide emissions and thus combat climate change has become a burden for consumers and resulted in increasingly widespread social discontent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the appropriate measures contained in the report on health care also require additional financial resources. It is particularly hard for the less developed Member States to find these resources, as they are already experiencing serious difficulties in financing very basic health care for their citizens. As I conclude, I should like to thank Mrs Ries for a very comprehensive and detailed report on the impact of the natural environment on human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are taking stock of what has been done up to now, and the question we must ask ourselves is this: have there been any visible results?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is sitting back and saying that it is satisfied. However, if the air we breathe and the water we drink are making us ill, it is high time for Europe to take action and become the driving force for a new overall approach to such health risks. That is why the Action Plan cannot be regarded as simply an add-on to existing EU policy; it must set new benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a highly critical position towards the Action Plan and has demanded major improvements. We are firmly convinced that the Action Plan is doomed to failure unless it is based on a pro-active policy of prevention, and one thing must be clear: without clear-cut quantitative goals, it will remain a paper tiger.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the environmental report bears a green handprint, especially when it comes to nanotechnology. It is clear that the potential new risks have not been taken into adequate account in the Action Plan. Indeed, it is scandalous that when it comes to the risks associated with nanotechnology, the European Commission is still burying its head in the sand and is claiming that the current legislation in place is quite adequate. We know that the very opposite is true. Nanotechnology is being allowed to develop in what is in effect a legal vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of electrosmog: we know that electromagnetic radiation poses a major and increasing problem, so it is quite unacceptable for us, as the European Parliament, to water down limit values which are already set much too high. Yet another issue is indoor air quality: the EU has set milestones when it comes to protection against fine particles, but what about indoor air quality, given that we spend most of our time in closed rooms? The Commission cannot continue to ignore this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to bring forward clear legislative proposals to improve air quality in all the relevant areas: construction projects, glues used in furniture, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving better protection for particularly vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women is also a matter which is very close to our hearts, and the precautionary principle should be the guiding principle for our legislation in all these areas. Naturally, we would have liked to achieve more, but we hope that the Commission will not stop at that. This area of work must not be allowed to come to a standstill, and we believe that we can take this issue forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome, in particular, that which Commissioner Dimas had to say. The rise in the incidents of certain types of cancer shows us that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I want to single out action in the field of mental health as being of the utmost importance.  Mental ill-health is a major risk factor for suicide in Ireland and suicide itself is the biggest killer of our young people. The EU should give more support to developing adequate prevention strategies, any actions at an EU or international level to help us promote mental health would be welcomed warmly.  </p>
<p class="contents">I also support the calls for action on the issue of indoor air quality and on the safety of chemical compounds used in equipment and furnishings. The Commission has taken some important action but we need a comprehensive policy on indoor air quality given the extent of respitory illness in the EU.  </p>
<p class="contents">We must also provide support for our SME's to ensure that they can comply with environmental health regulations and to take steps to improve the impact they have on the environment.  In my constituency a wonderful project in relation to this subject was supported by Interreg.</p>
<p class="contents">Our climate is changing and this brings with it new challenges in both the fields of health and environment. The new threats to our environment and our health caused by climate change must be met head-on and in an effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has been done, but more ambition and sensible concrete actions is the message I want to send to the European Commission today.!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you to Frédérique Ries, the rapporteur, for producing this report. This is a very ambitious programme, which is very difficult, even impossible, to assess. Furthermore, we are assessing the implementation of ambitious objectives in the highly diverse environment of the 27 Member States with differing health care systems and differing natural environments.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most serious worries going forward is cancer. We have often been faced with future predictions which are very threatening. There are statistics showing that this disease results in a huge loss of population mainly of working and retirement age. In many cases, the effect of the environment on the state of health of the population has been clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">No less important – and the report supports my emphasis on this – is the provision of information to the population concerning both the effects of the environment on health and the incidence of serious diseases and concerning the ability of various non-governmental organisations to support these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two sides to every coin: on one side, an important role is played by the provision of information by the European Union or local institutions, but on the other side, it is very important for the population to have access, to know how to obtain such information and facts and how to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention is only effective if its properly understood and interpreted and, if these conditions are met, it is also possible to monitor the response in real figures. It is possible to assess the plan with a short-term view, but the main consequences of implementation of these tools are best observed and quantified with a long-term view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Popular support for the EU project is actually at risk if we give the impression that we are on a mission to regulate every aspect of our lives – and that is the interpretation on the ground at the moment. We must be very careful to communicate exactly what the EU project is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like reassurance that the majority of this plan is not just repackaging and rebranding of projects already planned. We need better implementation of existing EU legislation at Member State level, and better monitoring and enforcement by the Commission. Greater assessment and, indeed, debate on the roll-out and effectiveness of the existing legislation is a priority as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority concern in terms of new legislation in this House has to be the climate and energy package. Climate change will impact on health in many ways, including malnutrition resulting from food scarcity in parts of the world; deaths and injuries as a result of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, storms, and fires and the consequent social problems therefrom; the increased burden of a range of diarrhoeal diseases; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases; serious problems with water scarcity – over 40% of the world will, in part, actually have water scarcity problems within 10 years – and drinking water. It is very welcome that this resolution on the mid-term review recognises the health impacts of climate change, and I applaud it for that.</p>
<p class="contents">On another point, a very serious issue – which really is still a Cinderella issue in terms of how we treat it at European and Member State level – is the whole area around European mental health. One in four Europeans suffers from mental health problems at least once during their life. In Ireland alone, the cost of mental ill health is estimated at up to 4% of our GDP and, tragically, there were over 460 suicides last year alone – recorded suicides. That was an increase of 12% on the previous year, in 2006 – in Ireland, a country which, on the best-place-to-live barometers, comes way up there, I think after Luxembourg. (I do not know who draws up the criteria for these barometers.) But we have to question this.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem with mental health in Europe, and the projected problems, deserves attention and adequate prevention strategies in this most important area. The rapporteur’s prognosis that the action plan is bound to fail, in all or part, is worrying, and I would like to hear reassurances from the Commission – but also from the presidency – that this will not be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Time and again the precautionary principle is ignored when people get excited about new discoveries. This is also apparent now with regard to nanomaterials and electromagnetic fields. Nanomaterials are becoming a more common phenomenon, even in consumer products, but the legislation is lagging behind, although researchers warn that nanomaterials could become a health problem on the scale of asbestos unless we take the risks seriously. The same goes for electromagnetic fields, to which hundreds of millions of people are exposed, even though we know very little about their effects. In some countries, such as Italy, there is a 500 metre safety zone between base stations and schools, while in Finland there are base stations even on the roofs of schools. New European norms which take account of scientific findings are urgently needed for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rapporteur, I believe that the plan is impossible to interpret and is doomed to failure. Some of its objectives such as the prevention of suicide or a communication strategy on the impact of climate change on human health are astonishing. The plan is ill-founded, both financially and in particular from an organisational perspective. The actions to be implemented are vague and give rise to doubts and questions rather than providing answers. The document also duplicates the World Health Organisation’s similar plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Environment and Health Action Plan is unfortunately just another subject for justified criticism as a waste of taxpayers’ money and pointless bureaucracy in Brussels.

We should invest in research, and then implement its findings. In addition, we should not merely pay lip service to the precautionary principle. We should apply this principle if we are ever uncertain as to the possible negative impact of a specific environmental issue on our health. The precautionary principle also prevents the spread of illnesses. It will prevent the spread of allergies and improve the way Europeans live and operate.

I have taken note, for example, of the reference to climate change made by Mrs Ek, by Mrs Ţicǎu and even by Mr Kuźmiuk, even though his intervention was focused in a different direction, and of the reference to agricultural problems made by Mr Wojciechowski, along with the reference to the Urban Waste Water Directive made by Mrs Estrela. All these subjects are interlinked and this apparent complexity must provide us with the additional motivation needed to improve our knowledge of environmental health issues. Yes, Mrs Doyle, the presidency is totally motivated in this direction. This will be achieved by way of the directives that we are working on at the present time, namely the IPPC Directive, the proposal for a soils directive and the energy-climate package, as I am reminded of the link with climate change. Through these directives we are in a way addressing subjects and establishing links with various recognised pathologies such as cancer, which has already been referred to by Mrs Belohorská.</p>
<p class="contents">However many new problems are also arising and these have been touched on by a number of today’s speakers. The problem of electromagnetic waves has already been researched in some detail, and here I am thinking especially of the Interphone study, but there are also new technologies coming on to the market all the time and these will in any case compel us to take an extremely long-term approach. I am also thinking of indoor air quality, a subject mentioned by many of you, which is something that should not be regarded as an emergent issue since it has always existed. However, it is much less researched than that of outdoor air quality, even though we spend 90% of our time indoors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferreira wanted to know if there was a link, for example, at national level in France between the environmental Grenelle and the European Action Plan. Within the context of the environmental Grenelle we have done a lot of work on environmental health issues and have come up against the same problems as those that you have been commenting on in one way or another. First of all we have the recognised pathologies, those areas that are well documented and where further progress needs to be made, including the question of cancers linked to environmental causes. Then we have all the new concerns where our actions can go much further. In the environmental Grenelle, for example, we have made provision for classifying all nanoparticles, for setting up a compulsory declaration process for those nanoparticles that are being put on the market, for providing a better regulation and monitoring system for indoor air and for introducing better controls for all interior equipment and furnishings, some of which present problems for indoor air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferreira, you asked about coordination and whether there was in fact any degree of coordination between the national environmental-health schemes and the European Action Plan. Clearly any link of this kind will present problems. We are currently in a phase in which each Member State is drawing up its own plan based on its own particular problem areas. Having said this, it seems to me that a measure of coordination could be introduced once this initial phase has been completed and this would provide the basis for the next stage of the process. Finally, if you would permit me, Madam President, I would like to allude to the fact that – while not wishing to offend those male Members who are also present and indeed I would thank them for their contributions – it has mainly been the female Members of this House who have spoken this morning and I see in this situation not a problem but rather an opportunity and perhaps also a sign of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this discussion has been a very useful opportunity to exchange views on the progress that has been made and the research carried out in key areas, with the aim of determining whether the exposure limit values set out in the Council recommendation need to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently asked its scientific committee for the emerging and most recently identified health risks, with a view to revising its opinion to take account of the most recent information in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest developments and the initiatives taken by the Commission on the specific issues of the environment-health relationship are very significant; they show that alongside the cooperation developing on a mid- to long-term basis between the environment, health and research sectors, it is possible to take immediate measures to further incorporate the health dimension into environment policy, with benefits to both the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the coordination that one of the speakers mentioned. Coordination between the various national environment and health action plans is achieved firstly through the Forum on Environment and Health under the auspices of the European Commission, and secondly through the WHO, in whose relevant activities the Commission actively participates.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards nanomaterials, six weeks ago, on 17 June 2008, the Commission adopted a communication on the scope of application of EU legislation to nanomaterials, which underlines the importance of applying the prevention principle in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">EU legislation may not refer directly to the term ‘nanomaterials’, but it should be accepted that EU legislation does to a large extent cover the risks associated with nanomaterials. The Commission has of course concluded that enforcement of the existing legislation must be stepped up and that the relevant texts, such as specifications and technical instructions, must be revised so that they can be better applied in the case of nanomaterials. The Commission will also continue, of course, to support the relevant research to fill the existing gaps in knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between climate change and health is clearly one of the increasingly important issues, according to the interim assessment, and I am glad it has been highlighted by many speakers today. This topic is to be covered in the White Paper on adaptation to climate change, which is to be approved soon.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the comment by our Polish fellow Member, which is not directly relevant to the topic under discussion but is very significant in the context of the energy and climate change package, I must make it absolutely clear that any increase in electricity prices in Poland and other countries where electricity prices are regulated will not be due to the introduction of auctioning into the European system of greenhouse gas emission rights. The increase will be due to the need for further investment in the energy sector, as there will be no investors if there is no corresponding prospect of profit from their investments in the energy sector. The increases will also come about because of liberalisation in the energy sector and the unification of the EU energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">Participating in the CO<span class="sub">2</span> trading scheme to combat climate change will account for about 15%, and it should be noted – and I must underline this, because I have recently read statements by Polish officials in many newspapers to the effect that it will create an economic problem in Poland etc. – indeed, I must make it absolutely clear that whatever money is needed for the purchase of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission rights, that money will stay in the country concerned, such as Poland, for example. Not only that, but Poland will have the additional advantage of about EUR 1 billion coming from the redistribution which will result from the auctioning of rights in the EU countries whose income per head is above the EU average.</p>
<p class="contents">These worries are therefore unfounded. Poland can only gain from the system and the package to be discussed in the European Parliament and in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Plan is an effective means of marshalling all the agents involved in the sectors of the environment, health and research at Member State and Community level, with a view to taking the environment-health relationship into account even more effectively when formulating environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective must be pursued even more intensively, with the cooperation of all interested parties and the support of the European Parliament. Once again, let me stress that I am happy with the cooperation we have and with the support of the French Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find that this area is central to the concerns of Europeans and is one that lies at the heart of the ‘People’s Europe’. This is essential. I want to thank every one of my colleagues and fellow Members for their views and assessments and also for the proposals they have put forward, most of which have been very ambitious indeed. I am not going to summarise them all here, for that has already been done by the Secretary of State and Commissioner Dimas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to return specifically to the question of electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet mentioned the Interphone study, but we are very focused on this problem: the findings from this study have not been published in full precisely because some consider them to be contradictory, whereas a number of experts who have been involved in it and are working in Israel have now highlighted the link between exposure to GSM waves and the emergence of cancer of the parotid gland. We are therefore essentially awaiting proof before acting. As I said before, when scientific uncertainty persists it is up to the politicians to make a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by mentioning our Amendment 1, as presented in plenary, and would call on you to support it, as it has been put forward by most of the parliamentary groups. It effectively confirms that when technologies evolve and change, as is the case in this particular area, the exposure thresholds should also be amended; otherwise we are doing nothing to help those consumers who might be at risk. I fervently hope that the French Presidency will support this proposal for an amendment of the 1999 recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within this brief scope, I would like to address the freshwater question. In Hungary and many other Union countries, global climate change basically means extreme distribution of rainfall.</p>
<p class="contents">Floods alternate with dry months, and this calls for a new water management strategy. We must manage every drop of freshwater responsibly. This can only be achieved through collaboration at Union level, and considerable Community resources must be made available for water management during the budget period starting in 2013, at the latest. Ensuring healthy drinking water throughout the territory of the Union, and using medicinal waters and geothermal energy as sources of heat, are related to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Several tens of thousands of European citizens have died in urban heatwaves, and alleviating these also requires water. By using the water projects of the developing world, our outstanding experts can also provide help within the framework of Union projects.

<p class="contents">Many pupils and children under school age are overweight and obesity has been caused by fast-food nutrition. Besides the fact that they live in a natural environment that is increasingly dangerous for their health, it seems that the social environment in which children are developing is not the most suited either.

The Programme seeks to define in absolute and unambiguous terms a specific strategy for soil protection that takes into account the principles of subsidiarity and regional diversity, which everyone understands very well.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 2007 – and here I too am retracing history – the Council held an advisory debate on the Commission’s communication on a thematic strategy and on the proposal for a directive. In December 2007 it examined suggestions for a compromise on the directives that had been drawn up by the Portuguese Presidency, which had undertaken an enormous amount of work on this proposal, and these proposals took into account the opinion expressed by the European Parliament at first reading. Unfortunately, and in spite of the considerable efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, it was not possible to reach a political agreement at that particular time. The disagreement took various forms: some Member States questioned the very validity of the initiative, in other words the need to introduce Community regulations for soil protection; others thought that a framework directive would offer greater flexibility and would in particular help take into consideration those national policies that had already been implemented, policies that were not adequately recognised by the proposal for a directive as put forward. Since then various Member States have had time to reflect and France wishes to reopen this debate within the Council. The views of the European Parliament will naturally be a key component in our discussions and in the revival of the debate that we now want to see through to completion. We are aware of the fact that you have had to find a balance between those who did not want to infringe the legitimate powers of the Member States in the area of soil protection and those who were calling for an ambitious harmonised system of Community rules. We believe that Parliament’s opinion represents a good basis for putting together a balanced package that we can all work on.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative has therefore been re-launched today, though it is too early to say whether or not it will be possible to reach an agreement within the Council, and if so when this will happen and on what basis. It would not be fair on my part to give any indications in this regard. All that I can promise you is that the French Presidency will do its best – and here I repeat myself – while at the same time taking account of the opinion expressed by Parliament, which has managed to adopt a balanced position of its own, and one that is therefore extremely valuable in this difficult discussion. At the same time we are realistic, for this is a very sensitive dossier – as everyone has seen in the course of previous discussions – and even in the best-case scenario a second reading cannot in any case take place until after the EP elections next year. We are therefore in no hurry and will take the time that is needed to reach the most consensual result possible on a subject that has in the past shown itself to be extremely complex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission, in line with its usual practices, presented a binding and, to a certain extent, reductionist directive. However, here in Parliament we realised that such a complex system as the soil could only be tackled on a comprehensive and theoretical basis. This is because soil affects the capture of CO<span class="sub">2</span>, it is the setting for human life, and it affects the productive system, agriculture, natural disasters and the creation of infrastructures. In short it affects everything and we understood that, in the case of 27 countries with very long legislative experience, many of these could not apply a directive based on simplistic criteria and extensive comitology. As a result, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, we developed a directive that was open, flexible, based on systematic criteria of self-organisation and aimed at a new development of Article 249 of the Treaty, which establishes that the Member States must have the same objectives and must meet these objectives, but allows them freedom in their application.</p>
<p class="contents">In this directive, existing legislation, existing catalogues and the bureaucracies of each country are respected. There is no obligation for the countries to do anything new if they can prove that the objectives of the directive have been met. Many of these countries have already fully met all these objectives. However, many Members have not understood this interaction between freedom and complexity, that order is possible within an open system and that open and flexible systems can exist within self-organisation. They have preferred to turn their backs on this legislation which affects life and the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand how governments concerned about climate change can allow themselves to oppose a directive that tackles the problems of the soil, the earth and climate change and that encourages disaster prevention, supports reforestation, agriculture and productivity, and respects all previous agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that we must understand what freedom is, as many do not know how to live with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This omission must therefore be urgently rectified as we all suffer as a result of it, particularly at times of food scares or debates on fundamental economic and energy alternatives which are essentially based on the soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Filling this gap in Community legislation would serve to highlight the measures that we advocate in the fight against climate change, including aspects such as combating increasing erosion and desertification, and not forgetting the serious problem of soil contamination or the sealing of this soil as a result of rapid and unsustainable development which is not only at the root of the current economic crisis, but also devours such a fundamental resource as the soil.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, including this issue within the European institutional legislative system would act as a stimulus to improve what is happening in the legislative process, by placing it within a coherent framework based on regulation and possibly on European funding which we could also link with the resources committed to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that the risks threatening this finite and non-renewable resource affect, to a greater or lesser extent, the whole territory of all the Member States of the European Union, including significant cross-border effects.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various Member States – as my fellow Member has just said – which are not particularly inclined to standardise soil protection at European level. They should remember that what this Parliament previously adopted is not only a flexible, adaptable and ambitious legal instrument but also one which is not excessively prescriptive. It is an instrument that could help in making the fight against climate change more rigorous and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Soil also has a very important function as a reserve of raw materials and as a carbon reserve, not to mention the CO<span class="sub">2</span> storage proposals that are currently being debated or the effects that may be indicated in the legislation on the scarcity of water.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive has been blocked in the Council since November 2007. This is unacceptable. Nearly a year has passed since this Chamber gave its opinion and I therefore consider that everything must be done to reverse this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Member States would have a specific regulation to protect the soil, not only with the aim of protecting the environment, but also to fight against climate change and the deforestation and desertification that are occurring. It would also create new areas for research, innovation and the application of technologies, lead to the creation of jobs and social opportunities and, in particular, improve the quality of life of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by encouraging the Council Presidency to pursue its efforts to get this vital directive adopted. Do not be disheartened, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet. We all know that there have been encouraging changes in the positions within the Council but you should be aware that we will not allow this directive to be stripped of its content.</p>

I agree with that completely. I will go further than that: I am, I believe, the first speaker up to now who can say in no uncertain terms that he does not see the need for a directive like this. I do not see why Europe has to have another directive. Why do I think that?</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, we already have many directives relating to the soil that affect the health of the soil and the soil environment. Just think of the Water Directive, the Groundwater Directive, the Nitrates Directive, the 18 Directives relating to cross-compliance. All of these have an influence on the health of the soil. In Europe – and this is true in France and everywhere else – we are weighed down by too many administrative rules. The average farmer needs more time to fill in forms about all manner of things than he has to do his normal work on the farm. If there were to be yet another directive on top of all that, then that would be too much of a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should first of all wait to see the results of the directives we already have: whether they are not enough and whether they do not make an adequate contribution to restoring the soil to a healthy condition. The Groundwater Directive will only come into operation in 2009, and so it is completely unnecessary to introduce a new directive before then. The Commission has produced a proposal and has calculated what the benefits will be. What I did not see anywhere in the calculation is what the administrative burden of implementing all this will be for those concerned. I will say it again: too much time is being wasted on administrative tasks, on filling in forms, on meetings and I do not know what else.</p>
<p class="contents">What could be done at this point in time? The Commission could play a very important role in the exchange of experience. There are certain countries that have already gone a very long way in restoring the soil to a healthy condition and there are other countries that have not. The countries that have already done this have done it without any help from Europe. Why not use those good examples for the countries that still have a problem?</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I think that we have too much red tape at the moment and that Europe and the European Union in general will certainly not make itself more popular with the citizens by piling one regulation on top of another and then saying to them ‘just get on with it’. No, let us reduce it as much as possible and follow the example of the Member States that could serve as examples for the other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The food crisis is increasingly making itself felt and the world population is growing whilst less and less land is being used for agriculture and the options for intensifying agricultural production are running out. In view of this state of affairs, sensible soil protection is especially necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The very best way of protecting the soil is through sound agriculture and farming. Soil that is not used for agricultural purposes soon becomes degraded. We are all aware that a substantial amount of agricultural land is not being cultivated and is becoming degraded. This ought to change. The European Union’s agricultural policy should ensure that it is profitable to cultivate agricultural land and legislation should encourage cultivation of the land.

<p class="contents">The background to this controversy is as follows. It all depends on our definition of soil: is it a treasure hoard of fertility, whose purpose is to provide a source of nutrition for our crops and which forms the basis of life in an ecologically sound farming system, with a high level of CO<span class="sub">2 </span>capture? Or is it simply a substance which supports plants in a system of agro-industrial production which involves the use of oil, chemical and genetic technology and has extremely hazardous climate impacts? These are the two trends which exist, including in the European Union. We also have soils which have been taken out of agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an opinion which triggered a certain amount of controversy because the rapporteur who was appointed wanted to reject a directive. The majority in committee then delivered an opinion which accorded with a sensible approach to soil management, and this has been taken on board in the report. From an agricultural perspective, it would be extremely beneficial if this directive were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot understand, let alone support, the opposition from the traditional farmers' associations. In my view, they are shooting themselves in the foot, because farming created our cultural landscapes during the course of history and is in a position to maintain them now.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot endorse the view that it would create too much red tape. Mr Mulder, you said that this is already happening in some countries, one of them being Germany. We do not want excessive red tape. Why should these examples which you have cited not be incorporated into a framework directive with a clear principle of subsidiarity, taking account of regional, cultural, social and climatic conditions, so that decisions can be made at grassroots level as to what is necessary and what is not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, its protection is crucial to preserve our heritage, natural resources, surface water and groundwater quality, health and human life.</p>
<p class="contents">As a very dynamic system which performs many functions and delivers services vital to human activities and to the survival of ecosystems, soil protection is a collective imperative in our common lives and in the defence of future generations. This means that it must not be subject to competition rules. However, soil is also subject to a great deal of abuse, to property speculation, and to degradation and contamination, including in border areas, which means that there must be better cooperation between Member States and the definition of common objectives in line with the subsidiarity principle and the social function of the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various Community policies which have implications for the soil and which may endanger its protection. That is why we need to further study the risks and various perspectives of soil in order to identify appropriate measures which can protect the soil. One very important contribution would be a change in the common agricultural policy to provide greater support for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers.</p>

We already have a raft of regulations on soil protection, waste, pesticides, the protection of the natural environment, groundwater and so on. Moreover, in the context of ‘better regulation’, which is something we in Parliament have been working on for some time, I realise that it is important not to give the impression that we are once again just putting things through the Commission mill and accumulating one regulation after another. I was also thinking about our local representatives and about our municipal mayors who will have even more on their plate with this framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another reality, however. The fact is that human practices have failed completely to treat our soil with respect and that efforts have been systematically made to engage in intensive production methods and in so doing to impoverish the soil and to adopt urban practices that have led to its degradation. I believe that Mrs Gutiérrez, whose work I would describe as remarkable, has presented us with very acceptable proposals in an effort to bring the different sides closer together – because indeed we see that there really is quite marked opposition within Parliament, just as there is within the Council – and that by listening to Parliament she has finally succeeded in putting forward proposals that appear to be as consensual as possible. She has produced a set of balanced positions that respect the subsidiarity principle, particularly in the choice of methods that the Member States are required to adopt in order to put the soil regulations into practice. She has avoided any increase in the administrative burden by urging us to make up for the errors of the past by way of our agricultural, industrial and urban practices, which until now have failed to respect the soil.</p>
<p class="contents">I now address the Council: when the Council Presidency tells us that we need not hurry, this means that they are going to put the dossier on hold. They are going to put it on hold when there is in fact a real need, given the disparity that exists between the Member States, to take up positions that while respecting the subsidiarity principle are clearly aimed at preserving and protecting our soil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because, in my view, we really do not need this directive. I think the previous Council had it absolutely right when they said they did not want it. I echo very much the words of Jan Mulder that we do already have the Nitrates Directive and the Groundwater Directive. All these things are beginning to take action on the soil and making sure we are cleaning up our soils throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Graefe zu Baringdorf that the farmers are indeed the custodians of the soil and that soil is so important for everything we grow, but do we actually need a soil directive? The problem with this soil directive is that it has been far too all-encompassing. We are trying to deal with industrial land and industrial pollution; we are talking about urban development and then about agricultural land and agricultural soils.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just nonsense to actually bring in legislation like this at this stage. I think one of the problems we have here in the European Union – and I think we do it out of the very best of intentions – is that if we need to do something, we immediately legislate. I do not think so. I think we have to pause for a moment and reflect. I think the Council got it right. I suggest that it is not time to bring this back. I would suggest that it goes back to a new Commission and the new Council in the next parliamentary session. They can look again to see what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage Member States that do not have controls over the use of industrial land and over pollution from industry to actually put those in place at the national level. Let us not interfere from the European level because I do not believe we need it. I think we want to make sure that we do not have the level of bureaucracy that we are getting. People are absolutely fed up to their back teeth with further bureaucracy.

I would underscore everything that has been said in that connection so far. However, none of these arguments means that soil protection should be a European task. Not every problem in Europe is necessarily a problem for Europe. Soil is a local, a localised medium. As a rule, soil contamination has no cross-border impacts, so there is no reason for soil protection to be a task for the European Union; nor, indeed, does it have any European added value. Many of the European countries already have soil protection regulations which work very well, and there is not the slightest reason to impose a European regulation on those that do not. Or do you believe, Commissioner – quite seriously – that wherever Member States are not taking action within their own sphere of competence, the Commission should fill the gap? That would be absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of subsidiarity, soil protection is a task for the Member States, and they are quite capable of dealing with it. That being the case, the Council – including your own country, Madam Secretary of State – provisionally halted this initiative. I very much hope that the French Republic will stick to this position. I have no doubt that it could be useful to draft a European soil protection strategy, and I would also have no problem with Europe making a financial contribution wherever optimum soil protection has not yet been achieved. However, I am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us, funded by the Community, simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries. That is not what Europe is supposed to be about. It would be a piece of completely superfluous bureaucracy of the type which sends citizens running for cover, before expressing their opinions in elections and referenda. It has to be stopped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This previously applied to both the old and the new Member States. In the last twenty years, the new Member States have not really had the money for fertilisers or chemicals and so, for example, four times less fertiliser per hectare is used in Hungary than in The Netherlands. The real solution to the question is therefore a farming matter, namely that in future we will have to use methods that protect the biosphere and the soil and that reduce this burden on the soil, so brand new methods and new approaches are needed in order to protect the soil, since this is in the interests of all European farmers. There are a huge number of irrational things in this system, for example crops are not planted after the harvest and energy is lost. Compostable crops could be planted and, for example, the fertiliser burden could thus be reduced. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the land that feeds the population, and we want it to continue giving us food, above all healthy food. The land, we all agree, is the environment, and we want to protect it, but I am seriously afraid we are destroying it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Soil Protection Directive makes a clear distinction between pollution caused by agriculture and pollution from industry. As regards pollution caused by agriculture, we see many efforts being made under the common agricultural policy, and many efforts within the scope of the Health Check; and recently we had the report on a significant reduction in the use of agricultural chemicals. All these efforts are being made in terms of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the major concern is what is being done about industrial pollution. We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned by the impact intensifying soil contamination is having on our agricultural produce and on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This pollution is reflected in the soil and water, and it is therefore advisable to adopt indicators and assessment thresholds before we reach the point of no return. Therefore, I urgently request that we monitor air pollution very frequently – we happen to do this thoroughly – and also monitor soil pollution. We should do this particularly in highly industrialised areas.</p>

Nonetheless, the Council has so far been unable to secure agreement. A few Member States still persist in acting as a blocking minority. There is now hope of achieving a compromise under the French Presidency. The presentation by the representative of France indicated that such hope did exist.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard much criticism of the project, alleging that it will increase bureaucracy or duplicate existing national and Community legislation. I believe the opposite is the case. Such a directive is needed, because it will result in unification of legislation in this area and will bring together at Union level all the efforts being made to protect the soil. In addition to local and regional efforts, action at Union level is required if we are to halt soil degradation. The soil is an asset common to us all. Common principles and objectives must therefore be established, and the relevant action taken. It is important for all Union citizens to become aware of the important part the soil plays in the ecosystem and also in our daily lives and in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, dangerous substances are still to be found on the territory of many Member States. I refer to landfill sites and chemical weapons left behind by the Soviet army present there in the past. Certain countries are not in a position to deal with these issues on their own. Appropriate encouragement and aid for Member States to assist such countries with the removal of such material is therefore needed. There is an urgent need for relevant provisions that will allow degraded land to be put back into use and will also limit soil degradation and ensure that the soil is exploited in a sustainable manner. All this would certainly be a step in the right direction in terms of protection of the natural environment and in terms of preserving the soil which is such a valuable natural resource. In this respect, the directive should prove very helpful to us. The legislative work ought therefore to continue. In addition, independent experts must be consulted and we should take their opinions into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we should bear them in mind this morning. This young farmer – and she is trained – has read the soils directive and has a real concern that for someone like her who is using minimum cultivation, doing the right think for the soil, this directive will penalise her, particularly in unseasonable weather conditions. She knows what she is talking about.

The Presidency is very much motivated by this directive and is convinced of the need for having such a directive on this issue. I would also repeat that this position has been steadily held, that it does not just date from the current presidency, and I cannot accept some of the insinuations that have been made in this regard. In December 2007, when the first debate was held in the Council, certain Member States – and there is an echo of this in today’s discussion – were formally opposed to the principle of a directive. Other Member States were already involved in drawing up national policies in this area and were of the view that while a directive was a good idea the proposal being put forward did not adequately respect the subsidiarity principle and did not take sufficient account of the efforts that had already been made, including points of a highly technical nature. At that time France was one of this group of states. Today, as we hold the presidency and once again remain faithful to this position, we are very much motivated and keen to find agreement on a directive for soil protection. For all that, we have all seen today that there are sharp disagreements and that these are a fairly true reflection of what has been happening within the European Council. We are striving to reach an agreement that may perhaps, as we hope, yield success during the current French Presidency. However, as we can all see, this is going to be far from simple. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me state that the Commission reaffirms its commitment to reaching an agreement on the soil protection directive, and will do its utmost to achieve that aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made its proposal on the basis of Parliament and Council resolutions calling for a comprehensive European Union approach to soil protection. I remember very clearly, Mr Nassauer, that in late spring 2006 I received a letter from the German Government with the majority – if not all – the <span class="italic">Länder</span> in Germany calling for a soil directive. We welcome Parliament’s strong support for a soil directive, albeit introducing modifications to the Commission proposal. I hope we can achieve the sufficient level of complexity indicated by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that the Council was not able to reach a political agreement in December, in spite of the enormous work done by the Portuguese presidency, the support of 22 Member States and the flexibility shown by the Commission. I stress that, while this political impasse remains, soil degradation is continuing, as has been made very clear by the scientific community, for instance at a high-level conference on soil and climate change recently organised by the Commission.</p>

In my long years in this Parliament I cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one. We are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on. Yet many Members are unsure. Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation, made even more complex by the intervention of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great uncertainty, great unease across a wide spectrum of this Chamber, which is why I believe we need to reassess, re-evaluate and examine more carefully the implications of these proposals back in the Committee on Transport. It is about getting it right, not about doing it quickly. By doing this, we will not be creating problems; we will be acting responsibly as legislators, defending Parliament’s right to work at its pace, not at a pace dictated to it by industry lobbyists and the Council of Ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is an unnecessary, and a potentially damaging, delaying tactic in the interests of the consumers of Europe, whom we represent. The first-reading agreement was struck in June with Council and Commission, after comprehensive debate and support in my – Transport – Committee. My shadow rapporteurs were fully involved with the process throughout and, as far as I am concerned, agreed the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Two presidencies – the Slovenian and French – have both cooperated fully with me in this matter, and I do not understand why more time is now needed to debate or scrutinise this vital measure. The fairest and most democratic way to proceed is to vote now on the agreement. Many of the people who are now protesting did not bother to come to the debate last night when Commissioner Mandelson, at my request, clarified to Parliament the assurances that a formal notice will be published in the Official Journal before the entry into force of this regulation, giving a clear interpretation of the regulation from the Commission’s point of view and very concrete and strict criteria (which happens on competition issues) to enforce these measures, in the interests of the consumers of Europe. I do not think that the consumers will understand these protests if we do not proceed to bring this measure forward. I therefore ask you, sincerely – all of you – to support me and the hard work that all of us have done across political groups to bring this matter through as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to have the same safety standards here in Brussels as we have in Strasbourg, and I can assure you that safety will always be paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at present, the final inspection by the experts will take place on 22 September. That allows enough time for a decision on the October part-session to be taken.

This gesture gives evidence of Israel’s willingness to build mutual confidence in the peace process, despite a severely critical Israeli public.</p>
<p class="contents">The same also applied to the recent exchange of prisoners on the Lebanese border. It is undoubtedly very sad that Israeli prisons are also holding Palestinian youths. The primary reason is, however, the fact that terrorist organisations are exploiting them, inciting hatred and a determination to kill. Over the last eight years, up to 16 % of suicide assassins and potential assassins have been minors and there has been a pronounced downward trend in age. Children’s upbringing and education are key factors which may have a significant effect on the future development of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to say that in putting forward this view we are not criticising the Jewish people, for we hold them dear and condemn all forms of anti-Semitism. We are not criticising the Israeli State, for we support its existence and want it to be secure, but we are opposed to those within Israel who are undermining democracy in that country, and that is something completely different.

However, what I regret is that there is no explicit reference in the report to the problem and the danger of Islamisation in Europe and in the world. That Islamisation is undeniable and puts a number of very fundamental European and Western values, fundamental rights and human rights at risk. I am thinking in the first place of the important separation of church and state and especially of the equality of men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Islamic countries themselves also get off far too lightly in this report, even though in a number of those so-called developed countries and in a number of those often very rich countries, oil states like Saudi Arabia, situations prevail which are unacceptable, from actual slave trade and slave labour to exceptionally far-reaching and degrading discrimination against women.

This involves consent to safe and legal abortions. Unfortunately, these amendments were accepted in today’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Every EU Member State has a different view of the artificial termination of pregnancy and they therefore make decisions on this problem in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Even the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty foundered on abortion in Catholic Ireland, abortions are forbidden in Poland, and Slovakia takes a different view on abortion. This is why I voted against this motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, Parliament rightly says that everything should be done to bring about a large reduction in maternal mortality in developing countries, but, on the other hand, Parliament continues to argue elsewhere for ever increasing, ever more extensive legal immigration and for the European Commission’s proposals for the so-called Blue Card. It is precisely this immigration policy that is resulting in a huge brain drain from the developing countries to Western countries, and it is precisely this policy that is robbing the developing countries of the best workers that they need, including health care workers, doctors and nurses who are needed much more in Africa than in the West.

This resolution is actually about the United Nations meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, and aims to put pressure on world leaders to take seriously MDG 5 on maternal health: that is what it is about. It is nothing to do with abortion in Poland or Ireland. It is about access to maternity rights. However, my explanation of vote was not about that.</p>
<p class="contents">What I wanted to say was that one of the saddest things I have ever seen in my life was in Addis Ababa at the fistula hospital we went to with a number of women colleagues as part of the ACP delegation. There we saw queues of young women – in fact they were really just girls of 13 or 14 – and there was a stream of urine coming down the street from where they were queuing. They were queuing up and there was a stream of urine because they had developed a vaginal fistula as a result of there being no medical care during childbirth in remote parts of Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is extremely important that the European Union invest in proper maternal health care in some of the poorest countries in the world. It is a disgrace that there is so little progress on this Millennium Development Goal, as it is one of the most important. I hope this will arm our negotiators, such as Glenys Kinnock, who are going to New York.</p>

There is a constant increase in demand for the development of services linked to modern technology and for high-quality services meeting the standards and expectations of their users.</p>
<p class="contents">The growth of GDP is increasingly dependent on the size of the services sector. Services represent a significant proportion of trade. This part of the market is constantly expanding. That is why there has been so much debate regarding the conditions and principles of the liberalisation of trade in services at global level within the framework of the WTO. There are many highly profitable types of services, notably those filling specific niches. This is one of the reasons why the liberalisation of trade in services is progressing slowly and why there is such great resistance to it. As I conclude, I should like to say that we are now living in times when services are the main indicators of development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These issues are also relevant to Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked myself how these texts could apply to the situation of Polish shipyards in Gdańsk, Gdynia and Szczeczin. Proceedings relating to State aid for Polish shipyards have been under way in the European Commission for quite some time now. The Szczeczin shipyard is the fifth largest in Europe and is experiencing serious difficulties, as is the shipyard in Gdynia. All this is due to a series of problems that have arisen over the years, which are a result of the change of economic regime and the international situation, as I pointed out when I took the floor yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the current situation of Polish shipyards, the Commission is of the opinion that they do not represent a source of employment. They are not exposed to unfair competition. That might well sound odd. In addition, it is proposed to close two slipways in order to achieve full potential, and this is simply ridiculous. The restructuring plan for these shipyards is forever being rejected, which is bound to result in them collapsing, instead of helping the European shipbuilding industry to regain its place in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to the listing of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions and fuel consumption: both must be clear to the consumer.

The UN General Secretary clearly emphasised that less than 10% of the budget is used to resolve problems affecting 90% of the world’s population. Pneumonia, infectious diarrhoea, tuberculosis and malaria - diseases which cause enormous health problems in developing countries but can be treated - benefit from less than 1% of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN has adopted a strategy supporting childbirth under qualified medical supervision. This is intended to limit the risks of motherhood, reduce infant mortality and provide access to services.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution, however, proposes, among other things, ‘provision of comprehensive and safe abortion’ and regrets the lack of provision of services in the field of reproductive health. It calls for the Council and the Commission to ‘guarantee that reproductive health care services are available, accessible and of good quality and promote the access of all women to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information and services.’ It calls for the Council and the Commission to intervene in this field, but abortion falls within the exclusive competence of Member States and not the EU.</p>

Yesterday’s ‘Polish plumber’ will tomorrow be Chinese or Pakistani.</p>
<p class="contents">The only exception applies to services ‘supplied in the exercise of governmental authority’, which are ‘supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one or more service suppliers’. In other words, the only ones not affected will be the police, the courts, the diplomatic service and the army. On the other hand, the GATS will be another step towards the dismantling of public services, a process begun by the Commission some 15 years ago in the name of competition and the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Union believes it enjoys a competitive advantage and asserts that its service providers have inadequate access to third-country markets. However, the services sector will end up just like our industry, with relocations and downsizing and, as a bonus, the import of social dumping.

The services sector is of vital importance to the competitiveness and innovation of the European economy, which is largely based on knowledge. Efficient operation of the European Union’s internal market in services is very important for the competitiveness of EU enterprises on the global market. Timely and appropriate transposition and implementation will be vital to sound operation of the market, especially in the case of the Services Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade in services largely involves the transfer of specialised knowledge between countries. Consequently, free trade in services plays an important part in all development strategies, because it facilitates swift and effective transfer of know-how on a large scale. In addition, increasing access to the market in services represents an opportunity not only for developed countries but also for developing ones, which are often deprived of access to know-how.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to the market for services is a difficult issue in the context of the ongoing negotiations at the WTO. It should be borne in mind, however, that negotiations on trade in services must serve the interests of the EU as well as promoting the development of the poorest countries. If substantial foreign investment is allowed, it could be precisely the liberalisation of trade in services that might facilitate increased and more sustainable production and the modernisation of infrastructure in all economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Technological progress, notably in the areas of telecommunications and information technology, has fundamentally changed the perception of services and their potential role in international trade. Dramatic expansion of the aforementioned system, together with technological advances, has resulted in the expansion of international trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland’s involvement in international trade in services has never been very great. The same is true of the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This was largely due to the underdevelopment of the sector in centrally planned economies. Fundamental changes in the development of the services sector only began during the period of transition that followed the Communist era, and continued throughout the process of accession to the European Communities. Radical changes in the services sector are already evident. Furthermore, Poland’s integration into the Communities and the related process of adjusting Poland’s economy to EC requirements should accelerate the rate of development of the services sector and provide increased opportunities for Poland to participate in the international trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the EU should make every effort to improve the quality of trade in services, as this sector promotes well-being and job creation in all of the world's economies. In addition, it helps to accelerate development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The privatisation of ports has been blocked until now by the port workers’ struggle, but has not been abandoned by the EU, because it is a key objective of EU capital.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission is now seeking to promote it by means of fragmentation, i.e. handing over profitable port services to capital. At the same time, the EU has its sights trained on state subsidies for ports; it is preparing for their abolition or drastic curtailment, thus paving the way for their privatisation. Ports represent sectors of strategic importance for the economy of the Member States and are directly linked to their defence capability and sovereignty. For this reason, the plans to liberalise port services and privatise ports affect not only those who work in them, but the whole of the working class and the masses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough for the working class and workers in general to be vigilant and to organise their struggle against privatisation plans alone; they must fight for ports that will be owned by the people within the framework of a self-reliant people’s economy under popular authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as it has invested in many other countries, the European Union has invested enormously in the democratisation of Mauritania; more than this, and even more importantly I would say, the Mauritanian people have contributed significantly and those responsible for the relatively recent overthrow of the dictator Taya succeeded in arousing huge hopes among the population of that country, while at the same time honouring each of their commitments from the organisation of the constitutional referendum in June 2006 to the presidential elections in March 2007, including the holding of local and general elections in 2006. This long process gave everyone an opportunity to have their say: trade unions, civil society and, of course, politicians. After just one year this coup has shattered everything and there is huge disappointment among the ranks of the democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">This catastrophe for democracy and for the people of Mauritania clearly reminds us of the extreme fragility of all young democracies and also of the special attention that has to be paid to them. It is now vital for us to condemn the new Mauritanian regime without equivocation. If the elected President had committed mistakes or blunders it was up to the Mauritanian people, to its parliament and to the country’s elected representatives to react, to criticise and to impose sanctions. It was not in any way whatsoever the right of the army, the gendarmerie or any other police force to involve itself in what is exclusively a political matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the new ‘strong men’ of Mauritania to restore to the people of Mauritania the powers that they have stolen from them. We demand that they allow the elected President to resume his political functions as soon as possible, even if this means suffering all the criticisms, provided that these are expressed in a democratic manner and with respect for the aspirations of the Mauritanian people who have once more been taken hostage by the wishes of a minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would add, Mr President, that I had the honour of leading Parliament’s observation mission to Mauritania and I am naturally deeply affected by what has happened. I will finish there and allow Mrs Isler Béguin, who led the European Union’s election observation mission, to take the floor. We very much regret these events because what we witnessed in Mauritania was a real desire on the part of the entire population, a desire that has been expressed throughout the past year, and what has happened now is a tragedy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A reflection of this is the fact that two military coups occurred in the country in the last three years. The second of these took place on 6 August 2008. A general seized power in violation of constitutional legality and placed the President, the Prime Minister, other members of the Government and many civilians under arrest. Oddly enough, two thirds of Mauritania’s parliamentarians have signed a declaration of support for the coup leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the possible involvement of fear of persecution, it is an affront to democracy and a sorry state of affairs when elected parliamentary representatives resort to admitting to the failure of the democratic process and declare approval of a military dictatorship. We call upon all political forces in Mauritania to put their people’s interests first, and with common-sense maturity to work jointly on restoring the constitutional order in their country. To this end, we urge and expect the EU, the UN and the African Union to offer all necessary support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to international observers in the country, the elections in 2006 and 2007 were conducted in accordance with the rules and there is no doubt as to the legitimacy of Mauritania’s ousted government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mauritania has had more than 10 coups or attempted coups since it gained independence from French colonial rule. The previous one was only three years ago. At the time the upper ranks of the army visibly took part, as they have now again. The development could hardly be described as stable or democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">The disputes between the democratically elected President and the generals in Mauritania in their attitude to extremist Islamism contributed to the coup. This is a huge challenge for others who are trying to bring peace and stability to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution quite rightly observes that the restoration of the legal and democratically elected government is a precondition for Mauritania’s stable, democratic development. It is therefore not an acceptable solution to hold new elections, as that would entitle the military junta to use force. What is precarious about the situation is that, if the country remains isolated, this will nourish extremist opinions and activity, which will sidetrack democratic development. For this reason, we have to support a UN-led solution that is as prompt and peaceful as possible. Our group supports the draft resolution on the situation in Mauritania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We were very proud of the results, because the great success was that after 24 years the military was handing over power to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Mauritania for eight days last week and what did I hear there? I heard a people who, having previously been so happy to have a civilian government, were once again pleased that the military had come back to ‘readjust democracy’, as they put it.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we call that a coup d'état. It is a coup d'état. We denounce it and we have denounced it. However, I think that we really need to go and see what is happening there and I would advise you, my fellow Members, to send a delegation to find out. The representative from the African Union, Mr Ping, is calling it ‘an atypical situation’. Mr Djinnit of the United Nations calls it ‘a reversal situation’ and both are saying that today we have to be creative. Indeed, when they say that there is deadlock it is quite true that there is institutional deadlock, but this institutional deadlock does not come from the coup; it is the result of a process of degradation that dates back to April and that culminated in June or July with a motion of censure that could not be voted on, with extraordinary sittings of the parliament that were not adopted, that were not granted and, indeed, with a resounding majority of two thirds, if not three quarters in favour of the President, which found itself overturned, with the call for him to resign. This truly was a reversal and for those who are not following things it is difficult to comprehend.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, fellow Members, to go and see the situation as it really is and would call on you to support the democratic legacy that the country managed to acquire at the last elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be remembered that institutions such as the Senate, the parliament and the municipal councils are still functioning and I really believe that these bodies are acting as custodians of the people’s power. I therefore think that it is up to them to find a solution. I believe that we have to trust in our parliamentary colleagues to propose a roadmap to this military junta, which we have rejected, and that it is really up to the representatives of the people, just as we are the representatives of our citizens, to decide what to do now.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we can give them this credibility and show some trust in them: if they fail to come up with solutions that are lawful and institutionally legitimate then we can intervene forcefully, but I believe that today these representatives of the people, who have legitimacy on their side, should put forward proposals and we should give them our support as colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should instead involve providing genuine assistance to people who are fighting for citizens’ rights and democratic values in areas where these are far more difficult to attain than in the European Union.

The recent coup in Mauritania is disappointing. For a country which has made much progress towards democracy in recent years, this coup is a setback to such advancements.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of a democratic Mauritania cannot be underestimated in this fragile subregion of Africa, so a return to democracy and civil rule is paramount. To overthrow a democratically elected government is simple unacceptable, as is the continued house arrest of the President and the Prime Minister of this country. However, it must also be noted that two thirds of the members of Mauritania’s Parliament signed a declaration of support for the coup leader and his fellow generals. Last Sunday, the generals constituted their own government which, in my view, must be regarded as illegitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">While not recognising this self-appointed interim administration, I would nevertheless encourage the military junta to set a timetable for dates for new presidential elections as soon as possible so that civilian ministers can once again be appointed instead of military personalities. The junta must commit to electoral neutrality as they did after the last coup in 2005. If such moves cannot be achieved in the very near future, the European Union must consider harsher measures, such as the suspension of aid of a non-humanitarian nature. The Commission must give serious consideration to the reactivation of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which could lead to the freezing of assets of members of the junta as well as the suspension of aid. Finally, I urge the European Union to collaborate closely with the African Union on a resolution of this political crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that in the wake of a military coup, in a deteriorating economic and social situation, the World Bank has reached the decision to suspend payments to this country has made the situation even worse and the people will soon feel the effects of this.

I am not exaggerating when I say that this House has probably expressed its condemnation of all kinds of coups in Africa dozens of times in the past. In the majority of African countries unjust rule remains and the same rulers have often been in power for decades. Billions of development aid has not changed that. The despots often remain in power and we roll out the red carpet for them far too often. This is cause for pessimism.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections that this Parliament helped to monitor were conducted fairly: that has already been established here. However, the events this summer in Mauritania provide further evidence that elections alone will not be enough to get democratic values accepted on a permanent basis in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson that we have to learn today is that Europe needs to have the courage to make economic support and development aid dependent on good governance and democracy, since at the end of the day it will be the Africans themselves who will benefit from that. However, the EU has not had the courage to adopt this position up to now. A verbal condemnation of the coup in Mauritania is not enough if the European Union does not take concrete sanctions at the same time to isolate the junta. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 6 August 2008, following the dismissal by President Adallahi of several army chiefs, the military reacted by carrying out a swift and bloodless coup d’état. At present, the elected President remains imprisoned in a guest villa. It should be noted that the Prime Minister has also been arrested, while other institutions, such as the elected Parliament, have not been affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years ago, on 3 August 2005, these same generals – at the time colonels – had carried out a similar take-over against the 20-year-old regime of Colonel Ould Taya, himself in power following a coup.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent take-over, nevertheless, is radically different from the one in 2005 that brought to an end a dictatorial regime and resulted in an exemplary transition to democracy strongly supported, politically and financially, by the European Union. This transition, through a series of free and fair elections, had brought into power the first democratically elected institutions in Mauritania, whose functioning must still be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">From the first day of the coup, our position has been clear. Commissioner Michel firmly condemned the coup and requested the release and reinstatement of President Abdallahi, as well as a quick return to constitutional rule. The whole international community followed with a very similar stance.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest decisions taken by the military junta – the self-proclaimed ‘High Council of State’ – to formalise the take-over and nominate a new prime minister and government are now a series of steps in the wrong direction, going against the demands of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">This coup, I think, represents a serious and evident breach of the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement regarding democratic principles and the rule of law. Therefore, on 2 September 2008, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council on the opening of consultations with Mauritania under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the results of the consultations, appropriate measures will be proposed. However, considering the potential negative impact that measures could have on the population, we still hope that an acceptable solution will be found without the necessity to isolate such a strategically important country, as many of you have said.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we will continue to follow developments in Mauritania, while fully supporting the efforts of the African Union to re-establish constitutional rule in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, let me comment briefly on two questions. It is too early at this stage to go into any details of appropriate actions to be taken on particular projects or areas of cooperation. I think we should wait for the results of the Cotonou Article 96 consultations, and it would also be good, Ms Isler Béguin, to wait for a delegation to go there. The Cotonou Article 96 consultations have to be started first.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are two important projects: one is a European Development Fund project that is ongoing (value: EUR 4.5 million) for civil society support, and the other is planned support for democracy and human rights investment (value: EUR 300 000). These would probably be continued in the case of a partial freeze of cooperation. So, at the moment, we are at the stage where we think that the Cotonou Agreement must be invoked and ‘96’ consultations have to be taken, and then we will see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For many Europeans, the respect for human rights is a gift they were born with. I come from a country that experienced the hardest communism in Europe, where human rights were not very high on its leaders’ agenda. I could not say that the 18 years of democracy have led to the complete disappearance of the cases of infringement of human rights but the situation is much better than during the years of communism.</p>
<p class="contents">The fragile African continent, whose centuries-old history has seriously marked the mentality of its inhabitants, is now also facing the threat of destabilization of an entire region following the coup d’état of the military leaders of Mauritania. They actually annulled the 2007 democratic decision of the Mauritanian people, which had elected its first president in a democratic manner. Compliance with the rule of law is the first, fundamental requirement for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regime in Mauritania does not have the people’s support and represents the exclusive wish of a limited group of people. The international community has the duty to make sure that things do not degenerate in this country, both for the safety of its inhabitants and for the stability of the entire region, where terrorism is a real threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents">The number of executions in Iran is currently totally out of control: according to official communications from the Iranian authorities, 29 hangings took place in one day at Evin prison in Tehran.

Iran is notorious not only for the sheer volume of executions, but the regular and merciless executions of juveniles and young adults who committed crimes as children.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas most countries that still impose the death penalty against adults do so exclusively for aggravated murder, Iran’s interpretation of capital crimes is extremely wide and includes homosexuality and adultery. The courts often impose such a sentence for what to us in Europe are misdemeanours or not an offence at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, teenage girls found to be sexually active outside marriage have been executed for so-called ‘crimes of sexual chastity’. As a Union, we should be unwavering in our condemnation of Iran’s appalling human rights record, just as we are of its efforts to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. We appeal here in this House for the Iranian President to show clemency, but I have to say I am not very hopeful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it must be said that executions by the dreaded and most barbaric method of stoning appear, thankfully, to be coming to an end. That is without doubt a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the fairness of many trials taking place in Iran leaves much to be desired. In many cases, the standards of administration of justice are far from those expected in the 21st century. In addition, persecutions on political and/or theological grounds continue to occur frequently. Such practices are a further stigma of shame on the governing authorities in Tehran. Furthermore, the execution of juvenile offenders continues, despite the international outcry.</p>
<p class="contents">With this new resolution today, it is very much to be hoped that the leaders of the regime in Iran will at last listen to reason and common sense, and will proceed speedily to bringing their country into line with internationally-accepted norms of rational behaviour. The Iranian people deserve much better than to suffer the barbarism of blinkered political or religious fanaticism imposed by severely short-sighted and grossly cruel leaders.

<p class="contents">Just three months ago, we drafted a resolution in this House on the executions in Iran. Unfortunately, there has been no change for the better since then. On the contrary: in the shadow of the nuclear crisis, the murdering by the Mullah regime continues unabated. Only a week ago, an 18-year-old man, Behnam Saree, was executed in public. The week before, a 20-year-old man was hanged for a crime he had committed at the age of 15. The procedure is always the same: the young man has to climb onto a stool, the noose is placed around his neck, and when the executioner kicks away the stool, the noose pulls tight. There is no mercy in this method.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this type of barbaric act, even greater barbarism is hard to imagine. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, could it get any worse? Yet I have to say to you: yes, it can! What is even worse is the execution of minors. The death sentences imposed and carried out on young people who have not yet attained their majority is a severe breach of the Islamic Republic's international obligations and commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran is party to a number of international conventions which commit it to refrain from executing under-age offenders. It is macabre – indeed, it is verging on the tasteless – when Iranian Government representatives respond to criticism of this practice by claiming that the execution is suspended until the person has attained their majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran is the country which carries out the most executions of minors and thus occupies a deeply shameful position at the top of the league. Since 1990, according to Amnesty International, no other country anywhere in the world has executed so many minors. In 2007 and 2008 alone, 15 young people were executed, and the situation of under-age offenders who face execution has reached an unacceptable, indeed a critical level in Iran. At least 132 under-age offenders are currently being held in death cells, and the real figure may well be much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Iran's prisons is critical as well: since 25 August, several hundred Kurdish political prisoners have been on hunger strike in Iranian prisons. They are protesting against the inhumane conditions, against torture and abuse, and against the death penalty. The international community must take urgent action here. We must continue to campaign tirelessly and insist on Iran's obligation to respect human rights.</p>

<p class="contents">The immediate consequence was that at least 10 women would not be executed by this brutal method. However, the satisfaction was short-lived because, in the penal code reform proposal currently under consideration by the Iranian Parliament, death by stoning for certain forms of adultery is retained.</p>

It has already been said, and I will repeat it, that 191 people have been executed this year and 317 people were executed in 2007. Only China can beat this record.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, we openly condemn the persecution, imprisonment and frequent execution of those people who engage in the defence and promotion of human rights, those who defend sexual freedom and those who are campaigning against the death penalty. All these people are frequently charged in Iran with carrying out activities against national security.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many cases that we should mention here, but please allow me to talk about at least one: that of the activist and defender of minority rights, Yaghoub Mehrnehad, an ethnic Baluchi and executive director of the ‘Voice of Justice’ Youth Association, who was executed on 4 August after having publicly confronted local officials about their attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue differs somewhat from others we are often called upon to debate, because Iran is not at war with anyone. It is not therefore subject to intense pressures that might provoke various kinds of criminal action. The Iranian regime was elected in a fairly democratic manner. That is another reason why there should not be any political pressure. In addition, there are no tensions between the different national groups within Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, at least one person is executed every day in Iran. Older people are executed for offences committed when they were 13 or 14 years old, and minors are executed too. The international community should draw the appropriate conclusions. It should exclude Iran from all the international organisations it can. Action of this nature can bring results. The best example of this is the fact that stoning has been suspended. I also appeal for the inmates of Camp Ashraf not to be handed over to Iran, because they would be in danger of being handed over to the executioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Iran, homosexuality is a capital offence, adultery is a capital offence, espionage, armed robbery, drug trafficking and, of course, apostasy are all capital offences: you will be hung if you do not toe the line.</p>
<p class="contents">According to opposition sources, political activists have been charged with criminal offences and executed. An Iranian man has been hanged for rape, despite his alleged victim withdrawing her accusations and a judicial review being ordered into the sentence. Mobile cranes and truck jibs are used for public hangings and, as there is no drop, this subjects the person being executed to a slow, painful death by asphyxiation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we press the Iranian authorities to systematically commute all death penalties for juvenile offenders at the very least, and to halt the execution of the four young boys who are awaiting execution at this moment. I would welcome the ending of the stoning of women – hopefully it will be followed through. However, as the resolution points out, it is worrying that there is new legislation seeking to retain it for adultery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The theocracy in Teheran clearly has nothing but contempt for democracy in Europe. All the same, it is good that Parliament has again condemned the executions in Iran in no uncertain terms. The execution of minors is not only contrary to international law, it is absolutely barbaric and it says everything about the merciless nature of the regime that has held sway in Teheran for decades. It should also be a warning to the naive people who think Iran can be handled with kid gloves.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there is something that this resolution fails to say. It notes rightly that more people are executed in Iran than in any other country apart from China. However, what should have been added is that since January 2005, the only countries to sentence minors to death and execute them have been Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen and Pakistan. It is no coincidence that these are Islamic countries where sharia is applied to the spirit and the letter. It may be politically incorrect to say so but the facts speak for themselves. These practices provide further evidence that this Islam, which has not yet had an enlightenment, is incompatible with our Western values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we all share the same profound, serious and urgent need to do something. There was a debate in June on the same issue, and yet between June and now the situation has unfortunately not improved but deteriorated. The extent and the severity of our concern is reflected in the growing number of statements published also by the European Union since the June debate – eight more to date.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned many cases and I also would like to mention a few. Last week, for instance, the day after the EU deplored the hanging of Mr Hejazi, a minor, yet another juvenile execution took place. On 26 August Mr Zaree was put to death at the prison in Shiraz. This was despite specific calls for mercy emanating not only from the European Union, but also from all over the world, notably from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Mr Zaree’s execution has brought the number of juvenile executions – as you have said – since the beginning of this year to the very high number of six. Information suggests that there are over a hundred minors on death row in Iran. Unfortunately the death toll keeps rising. As we speak, yet another minor, Mr Soleimanian, faces imminent execution. The moratorium on youth executions, decreed by Iran’s Chief Judiciary, is blatantly and repeatedly violated by his own judges.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the question of Camp Ashraf, the Geneva Conventions should of course apply as for anyone else. In the case of forceful deportation to Iran of Camp Ashraf residents, necessary representations towards the Government of Iran will have to be made. We have tried on many occasions either to speak up openly or to try discreet diplomacy. I, myself, on every occasion when either the Foreign Minister or the President of the Parliament came to see me on other issues – on nuclear issues – always made the case very strongly. We were only successful in one case and that was the stoning of women. I have always spoken out against that but, as you can imagine, I am also totally against what is happening to young people and of course, to the death sentence in general. However the Iranian authorities’ ears are largely deaf to our calls. We sometimes, therefore, have no choice but to resort to the so-called ‘megaphone diplomacy’ that Tehran claims to abhor and reject.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran must face up to its own responsibilities. Its behaviour can only cast a shadow over its already tainted international reputation. Without a concrete improvement in the human rights situation, our common objective of developing the relationship between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot proceed properly, even if the nuclear issue were to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the European Parliament and all EU partners will agree to this line and act accordingly. Today I call once more on the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully abide by the international conventions to which it is party. I call on Iran to spare the lives of all minors still languishing on death row. The whole human rights situation is indeed very difficult. As you know, we had a human rights dialogue, but unfortunately this did not work. We tried to work on public diplomacy and we are working closely with EU Member States to pursue a well-coordinated public diplomacy. We have allocated EUR 3 million for a TV news service in Farsi. We are also trying to work with civil society in Iran, but many obstacles are being put in our way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be noted that the police also bear a share of the blame as they tend to turn a blind eye.</p>

The minority in question are albinos, who are being killed and mutilated in Tanzania, including small children. This is a serious problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa. I would like to remind you that albinism affects one in 20 000 people worldwide. As mentioned in the previous speech, witch-doctors in Tanzania sell severed body parts and blood from albinos to miners and fishermen, who naively believe that they can bring them luck, health and fortune. Our position is very clear – the killing of albinos and discrimination against them is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated. The Tanzanian Government must take consistent measures to end this dreadful situation. The Government and President of Tanzania have already started to implement measures, which we appreciate, but it is not enough. The court case in which 173 people suspected of albino killings are to be tried will be a litmus test that will reveal the disposition of those in power in Tanzania, and the guilty must be punished. However, the best way to solve the problem would be through better education and adequate health care that is accessible to all the citizens of this country, including albinos. The international community as well as the European Union should render assistance in overcoming these problems. Most people with albinism die of skin cancer before they reach age 30. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discrimination and violence are practices which have survived from the time before the Judeo-Christian-Islamic civilisations, a time when there was no assumption of the equality of all persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Tanzania has 150 000 inhabitants who, due to a shortage of the colour pigment melanin, have red eyes, pale skin and fair hair. They are seen as products of witchcraft. Many of these people are murdered, after which their skin is stripped off and their skin and other body parts are used in magic rituals. Because of its large number of albinos, Tanzania is the largest supplier of human body parts for the whole of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be possible to put an end to these horrific practices without actively educating ordinary people in Tanzania and throughout Africa, providing better medical care and ensuring better access for albinos to prominent jobs. The Tanzanian Government is taking measures, including a register of all albinos, with a view to being able to protect them. Without changing attitudes on the position of albinos, this register could be misused in future to track down these people and exterminate them. We had bad experiences in Europe in the 1940s with the registration of threatened population groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I first heard about this issue, it seemed like something straight out of Joseph Conrad’s novel <span class="italic">Heart of Darkness</span>. I would like to believe in the renaissance and potential of Africa, as so many other colleagues in this House seem to, but the murder of albino people for their body parts does nothing to improve the image of the continent internationally. Sadly, the suffering of albino people is not limited to Tanzania but occurs all over Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the medical consequences of albinism in the tropics, including a high risk of terrible skin cancers, the long-suffering albino people are at best traditionally considered as freaks or curiosities, and at worst they are murdered to satisfy demand for traditional medicine that is more akin to medieval sorcery.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should not hesitate to campaign on the issue and bring pressure to bear on countries like Tanzania, where, apparently, such scant regard for human rights and dignity is common. However, I am heartened that the Tanzanian President has appealed to his people to change their traditional ways. Let us hope that other leaders throughout Africa repeat this important message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The victims included children. People alleged to have supernatural characteristics had been the subject of attacks in that area in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be recalled that 36% of Tanzania’s population lives below the poverty threshold. To all intents and purposes these people have no access to health care. Normal practice is to turn to local witch doctors for help. The low level of education of the local population contributes to its belief in supernatural characteristics. A large number of albinos live in the territory of sub-Saharan Africa and they have become the victims of open discrimination because they are different. Not only are albinos denied the right to health care, but they are also denied the right to social and legal assistance. It is standard practice to discriminate against albinos in daily life, in schools, in public institutions and on the labour market. Albinos feel that they are being constantly humiliated and treated like second-class citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The current intolerance could be countered and the number of attacks against albinos reduced in future by penalising those guilty of murder whilst at the same time undertaking fundamental awareness-raising work within Tanzanian society. It is essential to support the initiatives taken by the Tanzanian Government in this regard. Such initiatives include special protection for albino children along with cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations. Actions should be focused first and foremost on rural areas, where social awareness is at its lowest. In addition, the Commission and the Member States should give strong support to the emergency actions undertaken by the Tanzania Albino Society. Longer-term measures should aim at ensuring that the albino population enjoys full rights in terms of access to education, the labour market and also to social and health protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These murders are connected with the superstitious practices current in the area and are based on the belief that albino body parts such as the feet, hands, hair and blood will make a person healthy, wealthy and rich. The latest victim was a seven-year-old child. Last year too, 25 albinos lost their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">These occult practices take place along the shores of Lake Victoria, in farming areas and also amongst fishermen and miners. Albinos are often the victims of discrimination and persecution. President Kikwete has been using the police to try and locate albinos in hiding. The President has promised to provide albinos with protection, but the albinos remain mistrustful, because some police officers are also involved in occult practices. Witch doctors’ gangs are responsible for organising the murder of albinos. One hundred and seventy-eight local people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murders.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of Tanzania has been instrumental in the appointment of Mrs Kway-Geer as the country's first albino Member of Parliament in recognition of her fight against discrimination.

The latter is a subtropical country where albinos are discriminated against, as is the case in many other African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Albinos are murdered in a particularly brutal fashion in Tanzania, however. Last year more than 25 individuals lost their lives in this way. There are 39 million Tanzanians, 270 thousand of which suffer from a genetic defect caused by the presence of a recessive gene which means their skin lacks pigment. Consequently, albinos can suffer from sight problems, sunburn, cancer and premature death. Both parents have to be carriers of the gene for the condition to become apparent in their children. Women who give birth to albino babies are forced into divorce. The children are considered to be a curse on their family. They are thought to be possessed by unclean spirits and are treated as animals. On the other hand, however, witch doctors spread tales of the magical properties of albinos’ white skin, which allegedly helps to bring luck and wealth. This leads to the killing of albinos who are then brutally quartered and their body parts used in the production of potions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to understand what the reason for such cruelty might be and what purpose it could serve. Perhaps it is an attempt to eliminate sick people who have a genetic defect. In recent times, the government has condemned the use of force against white-skinned Africans and run educational campaigns. An albino member of parliament has even been appointed. Nonetheless, the tragedy affecting these people still continues. In addition, there is a lack of funding for protective clothing and other assistance for this marginalised sector of the population which is discriminated against and denied work and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Protests and appeals by the international community, together with educational and financial help would help to counter extreme discrimination of this type. Bringing legal proceedings against the 173 would-be witch doctors arrested and accused of murderous activity, incitement to murder and trade in human organs would also help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By raising this issue here (and I commend all my colleagues who have raised it and those who put this item on the agenda), we add our voice in the European Parliament to the international voice of protest, and hopefully the Tanzanian Government – and indeed others – will listen.</p>

<p class="contents">In particular, we share the concerns recently reported by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women that, for instance, albino women and girls have been targeted very specifically in ritual killings. We condemn all forms of discrimination and victimisation, and we are committed to supporting policies and actions aimed at eradicating them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government of Tanzania, too, it must be said, is committed to stamping out these practices and raising awareness of the plight of the albino population. Therefore, we welcome the nomination of an albino Member of Parliament, the recent arrests of some witch doctors, and the President’s commitment, as has been mentioned, to bringing those responsible to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We also closely monitor the human rights situation in general in Tanzania, together with Member States and other development partners. Several Member States and other partners are supporting organisations, such as the Legal and Human Rights Centre, which regularly monitor possible human rights violations. As a member of the Donor Group on Governance, the Commission will continue to coordinate donor responses to addressing the problem, including the Albino Association.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also, with Member States in Tanzania, raise the problem in its political dialogue with the Tanzanian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 3 million EDF-funded Civil Society Programme will help to create awareness: workshops are being organised to highlight the albino situation and a new sensitisation campaign is shortly to be implemented in the Mwanza region of Northern Tanzania.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in general, we use our regular dialogues to refer to this issue. These questions are, of course, also being raised in our ongoing exercise concerning public funds and the health, education and employment sectors. We believe that an independent and functioning judicial system is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we, the Commission, in our contacts with the authorities, will underline the importance of appropriate legal action being taken against the perpetrators of these horrible acts.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also contact the honourable Kway-Geer, the first Albino Member of Parliament in Tanzania (she has already been mentioned), and discuss possible actions with her, because she can tell us even better what can be done. Finally, together with the presidency in Tanzania, we will discuss this issue at the 60th anniversary of the signature of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights planned in Tanzania on 10 December 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Calls for the new resolution to foresee the figure of a Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, with the task of monitoring the situation, ensuring maximum transparency in the capital punishment system and favouring an internal process directed at the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the moratorium on executions’. </p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>On 19 and 20 June the European Council noted the outcome of the Irish referendum and noted that the ratification process was continuing in other Member States.</p>
<p>The French Presidency is in close contact with the Irish authorities. Mr Sarkozy visited Dublin along with Bernard Kouchner on 21 July in order to listen to and understand the different points of view. They met with the Irish authorities, the leaders of the political parties and representatives of civil society. Further contacts are due to take place in the months ahead in both Paris and Dublin.</p>
<p>I noted the recent statements by the Irish Minister for European Affairs on the possible prospect of allowing the Irish people to vote in another referendum.</p>
<p>As the European Council indicated in June, we respect the sensibilities and the choice of the Irish people. However, we must not forget that 24 national parliaments have approved the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>Moreover, your Assembly is very aware of the fact that in the new uncertain international climate it is crucial for the Union to have at its disposal the political and legal resources and instruments that will allow it to fulfil its objectives.</p>
<p>With a view to the European Council meeting in October, we will make every effort to help the Irish authorities to draw up proposals for the future. It is important for these proposals to be ready by October so that a solution acceptable to all 27 Member States can be found as quickly as possible. At an institutional level, we cannot waste any time. We need to act. We must ensure that, on the basis of the Irish proposals, we are ready to put in place our future legal framework and to put into practice the lessons we have learned when it comes to the organisation of the European elections and composition of the Commission in 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0542"></a>

<p>The Union’s position is clear. It has reiterated it on several occasions:</p>
<p>As far as the European Union is concerned, the establishment of settlements in the occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. The act of establishing settlements prejudges the result of the negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian Territories and threatens the viability of an agreed solution based on the coexistence of two States.</p>
<p>In July and August the European Union once again called on Israel to suspend all settlement activities, notably those linked to ‘natural growth’, including those in East Jerusalem, and to dismantle the uncontrolled settlements established since March 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0551"></a>

<p>The accession negotiations with Croatia are making good progress and have entered a key phase in 2008. Since the beginning of the negotiations in October 2005, 21 chapters have been opened, and three of these have been provisionally closed:</p>
<p>Chapter 25, ‘Science and research’</p>
<p>Chapter 26, ‘Education and culture’</p>
<p>Chapter 20, ‘Enterprise and industrial policy’</p>
<p>In addition to the closing of Chapter 20, the Accession Conference of 25 July saw the opening of Chapter 1, ‘Free movement of goods’.</p>
<p>The rate of the negotiations depends, and will depend, first and foremost on the progress Croatia can make in terms of fulfilling the conditions laid down.</p>
<p>The main challenge now is to draw on the progress that has been achieved in order to speed up the rate of the reforms and their implementation, notably:</p>
<p>the reform of the justice system and public administration</p>
<p>the fight against corruption, minority rights</p>
<p>the economic reforms.</p>
<p>In the field of regional cooperation, the EU encourages Croatia to continue its efforts to establish good neighbourhood relations in order to:</p>
<p>find definitive, mutually acceptable solutions to all the outstanding bilateral questions with neighbouring countries, particularly border issues</p>
<p>work towards reconciliation among the people of the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0556"></a>

<p>reduction in export refunds</p>
<p>removal of the set-aside requirement for 2008</p>
<p>increase in milk quotas and suspension of import duties for cereals.</p>
<p>These measures have helped to improve supply and stabilise the agricultural markets.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>I provided a partial answer to this question on 8 July in response to the question posed by your colleague Mr Matsis.</p>
<p>However, it is true that during the summer the situation changed somewhat. We are now seeing a slow-down in the increase in the price of raw materials. That is good news, even if it is still not enough. It is still important to emphasis it, nonetheless.</p>
<p>As you know, on 19 and 20 June 2008 the European Council discussed the development of agricultural and food prices. A series of specific measures were thus introduced with a view to the European Council in October or December 2008.</p>
<p>As I have just said, it is important in this respect to reiterate the measures already taken by the Union in order to moderate the pressure on food prices and stabilise the markets, for example selling intervention stocks, reducing export refunds, removing the set-aside requirement and increasing milk quotas.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures to be taken, the European Council has highlighted the importance of ensuring the sustainability of bio-fuel policies, assessing the possible impacts of these policies on agricultural products for food and taking action, if necessary, to deal with any problems.</p>
<p>Specific measures to support the most disadvantaged, both in Europe and around the world, are also being drawn up in the Commission and the Council will examine these in October.</p>
<p>I am not forgetting the links between this issue and development of international trade, however.</p>
<p>The negotiations in July on the Doha Round did not produce a balanced agreement, despite all the EU’s efforts. It is not time, within a multilateral, or failing that a bilateral and regional, framework to look for the means to enable third countries to improve their production and promote their exports.</p>
<p>The European Council has welcomed the Commission’s initiatives to examine the issue of restrictive regulations in the retail sector and to closely monitor activities in commodity-related financial markets, including speculative trade, and their impact on price movements as well as any policy implications. It has invited the Commission to report back on this issue in advance of the December 2008 European Council and to consider proposing adequate policy responses, including measures aimed at improving market transparency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0562"></a>

<p>The Council attaches great importance to the training of the judiciary and judicial staff, and to judicial cooperation in developing the European area of justice.</p>
<p>We have not yet defined all of the instruments at Community level, however. A number of initiatives have therefore been launched:</p>
<p>on 7 and 8 July in Cannes the French Presidency devoted a significant proportion of the informal meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for justice and home affairs to the subject of training of the judiciary and judicial staff. The Member States unanimously agreed that efforts in this area had to be stepped up considerably.</p>
<p>subsequently, on 10 July, France, together with 10 other Member States, tabled a draft resolution of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting in the Council with a view to offering substantial political support for greater action in the field of training of the judiciary and judicial staff in the European Union.</p>
<p>a further initiative aimed at harmonising efforts, the European Judicial Training Network, has been launched in the form of a non-profit-making association under Belgian law, outside the scope of the EU’s legal framework. This initiative receives Community funding and financial support from the participating Member States. We hope that it will be incorporated within the EU system. The French Presidency is not just in favour of this; it will actively support the project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0568"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 26-27 May 2008, the Council recalled that the European Union wishes to see a sure, stable, democratic, prosperous and unified Afghanistan where human rights are respected. In general, the European Union is highly committed to Afghanistan. Not only all of its Member States, but also the European Commission, finance programmes to promote governance and the rule of law, rural development, health and social protection, mine clearance and regional cooperation. Consequently, at the International Conference in support of Afghanistan held in Paris on 12 June the European Commission announced that it will contribute EUR 500 million to these actions over the period 2008-2010. As far as the EU’s activities in Afghanistan are concerned, I must also mention the ESDP EUPOL Afghanistan mission, which does remarkable work in training the Afghan police.</p>
<p>Over and above these specific European actions in Afghanistan, the honourable Member rightly emphasises the fact that the action of the international community in Afghanistan is based on two principal elements: one military and one that consists of civil reconstruction. Both of these aspects are intertwined and stem from the international community’s global approach in Afghanistan. Indeed, the international military presence can only be justified if it seeks to create conditions that will promote the institutional, economic and social development of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>As a result, the international effort in Afghanistan must encompass both aspects. In fact, after having strengthened its military effort in Afghanistan at the Bucharest Summit in April, the international community also decided, at the International Conference in support of Afghanistan in June, to increase substantially and over a considerable period its political and financial commitment to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. By amassing almost EUR 14 billion and renewing the partnership between the international community and the Afghan authorities, the Conference proved to be a great success for Afghanistan and its people. It was also a great success for the European Union, which succeeded in emphasising fully its positions on key issues for the successful development of the country.</p>
<p>As far as Iraq is concerned, in its conclusions of 26-27 May 2008 the Council reiterated its desire for a safe, stable, democratic, prosperous and unified Iraq where human rights are respected. The European Union carries out aid missions to support the reconstruction of the country. As regards the rule of law, the EUJUST LEX programme has enabled 1 400 Iraqi police, judicial and penitentiary personnel to be trained. Given the positive results of this mission, its mandate is likely to be extended in June 2009 with a view to adapting the training to the changes in the security situation in Iraq and ensuring that the Union’s efforts meet as closely as possible the needs of those working in these sectors. In addition to these cooperation activities, the European Union is actively involved in Iraq’s reintegration into the international community through its support for the International Compact with Iraq and its negotiations on the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to remember that a balance must be maintained between the spending on military operations on the one hand, and the spending on reconstruction and humanitarian aid on the other, and above all, that the two elements of the operation are both part of the same objective of improving security and maintaining peace.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0579"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Brussels.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, peace and reconciliation in the Middle East are a strategic priority of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) for the EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Union today is involved in two major types of efforts to promote peace in that region.</p>
<p>Firstly, it cooperates closely with the other members of the Quartet and its partners in the region to encourage the Israelis and Palestinians to resolve together the disputes that divide them with a view to concluding a peace agreement before the end of 2008, as agreed in Annapolis last November. In particular, the European Union has for more than 10 years appointed a special representative with responsibility for the peace process to work alongside both parties. This post is currently held by Ambassador Marc Otte.</p>
<p>Secondly, the European Union has recently established an action strategy entitled ‘State-building for peace in the Middle East’. Presented in November 2007 and endorsed by the Member States during the General Affairs and External Relations Council, this strategy organises, in particular, the activities relating to the EU’s current and future technical and financial assistance aimed at strengthening Palestinian state-building.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the European Union and its Member States have for a long time been the largest donors to the Palestinian Authority: they alone account for almost one third of its budget and more than half of all foreign aid. This EU support is provided notably through a special financing mechanism, currently known as PEGASE. This mechanism has just supported the three-year Palestinian Reform and Development Plan, which was approved in December 2007 by the international financial institutions and which relates to governance of the Territories, public infrastructures, private sector development and social development.</p>
<p>However, the European Union is not content to be merely a donor: for example, it is also involved in training and providing equipment for the Palestinian police (so-called EUPOL COPPS mission, a civilian mission governed by the legal regime for ESDP missions). The Union is also prepared at any moment to resume its border assistance mission at the Rafah border point (EUBAM Rafah) when circumstances so permit.</p>
<p>With a view once again to strengthening Palestinian state-building, the European Union has also organised, or strongly supported, in close collaboration with the Quartet representative, Mr Tony Blair, three international conferences in less than a year concerning: the financing of the Palestinian Authority (Paris Conference, December 2007); private investment in the Palestinian Territories (Bethlehem Conference, May 2008); and finally, support for civil security and the rule of law (Berlin Conference, June 2008). Each of these conferences resulted in resources being made available and new measures being agreed upon to strengthen Palestinian state-building.</p>
<p>Finally, within the framework of the action strategy, the Union is examining the specific contribution it could make to the implementation of a future peace agreement supported by the parties.</p>
<p>The honourable Member can therefore rest assured that the European Union is exploring every avenue and intends to use all its influence to ensure that the Middle East peace process continues to move forward.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0583"></a>

<p>In accordance with the Community legislation on VAT and excise duty, all goods brought into the European Union from a third country are subject to tax.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to avoid double taxation, a Community system of tax-free allowances is applied to non-commercial imports of goods contained in the personal luggage of travellers coming from third countries. At present, and in accordance with Directive 69/169/EEC<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Member States do not apply tax to goods whose value does not exceed EUR 175.

<p>In addition to these monetary thresholds, certain quantities of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages may also be imported duty-free and the limits for these items are laid down in the Directives.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Directive 69/169/EEC also lays down quantitative limits for exemptions from excise duty for tea, coffee and perfume, which will be abolished from 1 December 2008 pursuant to Directive 1007/74/EC.</p>

<p>In July, the Union for the Mediterranean was inaugurated: an effort to bind the 17 nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea with the European Union around regional projects. Some of the countries, however, have deplorable human rights records.</p>
<p>In Morocco, for example, a large mass grave was discovered in March in the city of Fez, 250 kilometres north of Casablanca. Human rights activists believe the bodies were shot by the army in an attempt to break a general strike in 1990. According to experts, the discovery of the bodies in mass graves shows how serious the violations of human rights have been in the recent modern history of Morocco. Up until now, the Moroccan authorities have not abolished the death penalty nor ratified the Rome Statute.</p>

In the declaration adopted at this Summit the Heads of State and Government also underlined their commitment to strengthen democracy and political pluralism. They also affirm their ambition to build a common future based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in the relevant international instruments, including the promotion of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, strengthening the role of women in society, respect for minorities, the fight against racism and xenophobia, and the advancement of cultural dialogue and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, the association agreements and action plans that exist within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy contain commitments to human rights and provide for the possibility of raising questions on this aspect. Thus, bilateral dialogue focusing specifically on human rights has been initiated with several countries of the Southern Mediterranean, notably Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0600"></a>

On the pretext of combating organised crime they assist in the killing of leading politicians and trade unionists and are generally hostile to working class movements, not only in Iraq, where their brutality has become a byword, but also in Afghanistan, Latin America and other areas, where they operate with state-of-the-art heavy weaponry furnished by the arms industry acting mainly on instructions from civilian governments.</p>

One cubic metre of methane actually produces the same effects as 24 cubic metres of carbon dioxide. Methane is released into the atmosphere by mining, animals and humans, and putrefactive processes.

<p>As you know, in January 2007 the Commission presented the ‘energy/climate’ legislative package, which seeks to tackle simultaneously the challenges of reducing greenhouse gases, improving energy security and guaranteeing the European Union’s competitiveness in the long term. The package contains numerous proposals in the area of energy and climate change.</p>
<p>One of the proposals in the package, the proposal on effort sharing, covers all the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>As regards agriculture and climate change more specifically, I would remind you that in its conclusions of 19-20 June 2008 the European Council states that it is essential to pursue work on innovation, research and development of agricultural production, notably to enhance its energy efficiency, productivity growth and ability to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>To date, the Council has not received any proposals concerning the appointment of a body to assess the real influence of all the factors contributing to the greenhouse effect, but, as you know, the discussions on the proposals in the ‘energy/climate’ package are continuing in the Council and with the European Parliament with a view to reaching a global agreement before the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0610"></a>

<p>Recently Israel has been adopting an increasingly bellicose stance towards Iran in response to its nuclear programme, stepping up its threats to launch a military offensive. This has been made abundantly clear in recent statements issued by the Defence Minister Ehud Barak that Israel is prepared to move against Iran, pointing out that Israel has in the past repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to take unhesitating action. From 28 May to 12 June 2008 the threats were backed up by the ‘Glorious Spartan’ air force manoeuvres on Greek territory organised jointly by Greece and Israel simulating a hypothetical Israeli attack on a nuclear plant in Iran. These developments confirm that aggressive imperialist tactics by Israel pose a constant threat to peace in the area and to the peoples affected.</p>

<p>The Council supports the approach of the General Secretariat/High Representative Javier Solana and the Group of Six (Germany, China, United States, France, United Kingdom, Russia), which are actively seeking a diplomatic solution to the crisis between Iran and the international community on the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme. The issues involved in the Iranian nuclear affair have a considerable impact on the stability of the region and the international non-proliferation regime.</p>
<p>The Council is making every effort to reach a peaceful and negotiated solution that responds to the concerns of the international community. To this end, as the Council has reiterated on many occasions, we must resolutely pursue the ‘double approach’ that combines an openness to dialogue and increasing sanctions if Iran refuses to apply the decisions of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council regrets all statements that are likely to jeopardise the efforts to reach a negotiated solution and recalls that it has condemned in the strongest possible terms the threats made on several occasions by the Iranian authorities against Israel.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0573"></a>

<p>In the summer of 2007 the Commission launched a review of the activities of credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the credit markets and their role in the subprime turmoil.</p>
<p>In view of the lessons learned following that review, work is now advanced on a regulatory response to a series of problems identified in relation to CRAs. The Commission is consulting on the main features of a regulatory framework. The documents subject to consultation suggest the adoption of a set of rules introducing a number of substantive requirements that CRAs would need to respect for the authorisation and exercise of their rating activity in the EU. The main objective would be to ensure that ratings are reliable and accurate pieces of information for investors. CRAs would be obliged to deal with conflicts of interest, have sound rating methodologies and increase the transparency of their rating activities. The consultation documents also propose two options for an efficient EU oversight of CRAs: The first option is based on a reinforced co-ordination role for the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and strong regulatory co-operation between national regulators. The second option would combine the establishment of a European Agency (either the CESR or a new agency) for the EU-wide registration of CRAs and the reliance on national regulators for the supervision of CRA activities. The consultation also deals with possible approaches to the issue of excessive reliance on ratings in EU legislation.</p>
<p>This preparatory work should conclude in autumn 2008 with the adoption of a legislative proposal by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0594"></a>

<p>In reply to the first part of the question, the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Members to the conclusions of the June 2008 European Council. The European Council noted the outcome of the referendum in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty and agreed that more time was needed to analyse the situation. It noted that the Irish Government would actively consult, both internally and with other Member States, in order to suggest a common way forward. The European Council recalled that the purpose of the Lisbon Treaty is to help an enlarged Union to act more effectively and more democratically. It noted that, by then, parliaments of 19 Member States had ratified the Treaty and that the ratification process continues in other countries. Indeed, since then the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty has been approved in a further three countries. The European Council indicated that it will address this issue on 15 October in order to consider the way forward. The President in office of the European Union, Mr Sarkozy, confirmed this approach in his intervention on 10 July 2008 before Parliament.</p>
<p>The Internal Market is and will remain at the heart of the European integration. Its future is not directly linked to the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore work will continue to strengthen the Internal Market and to make it more efficient so it can continue to be a driver of prosperity and economic growth to the benefit of European citizens and businesses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0544"></a>

<p>Over the last few years, Vietnam has experienced a significant economic boom which has been supported by (amongst other things) the EU's development-aid and financial-support policies. The growth in the country's GDP has been matched by an increase in human-rights abuse. In particular, over 250 Montagnard political prisoners who were arrested in 2001 and 2004 have yet to be released, whilst a growing number of Khmer Kampuchea Krom are seeking asylum in Cambodia on account of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Given that the Commission is making efforts to ensure that its development policies are more consistent with human rights, can the Commission consider itself satisfied with the impact which its support has on the situation of ethnic and religious minorities, immigrant workers and democracy activists in Vietnam?</p>

<p>While recognizing the benefits of the economic openess of Vietnam, the Commission shares the Parliament’s concern on the human rights situation in the country. Rights of ethnic and religious minorities as well as of human rights activists are essential foundations of a democratic society and sustainable development. The Commission is extensively involved at the national, regional (ie. ASEAN), and multilateral levels to ensure respect and protection of these rights. While the Commission is actively promoting projects that focus on advancing human rights protection in Vietnam, it recognizes that there is still a lot to be done.</p>
<p>Currently the Commission is implementing numerous projects that aim to enhance life quality of the poor and disadvantaged people in Vietnam. The Commission is implementing a 18 million euro project (for the years 2006-2010) with the main objective to improve health standards by providing high quality preventive, curative, and promotive care to the poor living in the Northern Uplands and Central Highlands. Additionally, the Commission contributes 11.45 million euro in grant to a project implemented by the World Bank, that will provide an increased coverage of essential health services, particularly at the commune level in the mountainous areas in Vietnam. The project is expected to benefit some 3 million people, mostly ethnic minorities and poor people. There is also a joint project of the Commission and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that will ensure equal and unrestricted access to education for disadvantaged indigenous families.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to press the Vietnamese government for progress in human rights protection during the local human rights dialogue, and a Joint Committee Sub-group on Human Rights. In addition, during the ongoing negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), the Commission is strongly insisting on including the essential elements human rights clause and a human rights cooperation clause.</p>
<p>During the upcoming visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Vietnam, Mr. Pham Gia Khiem, the Commission will address the issue of Vietnam’s international obligations, and will urge the Vietnamese government to observe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights standards in its internal laws.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0552"></a>

<p>The European Neighbourhood Policy is and will remain a key priority for the Commission. In this context the Commission is keen to strengthen bilateral relations with its Eastern partners. Suggestions which pragmatically contribute to this goal, such as the Polish-Swedish initiative are welcome.</p>
<p>In June 2008, the European Council invited the Commission to take the work forward and to present to the Council in spring 2009 a proposal for modalities of the "Eastern Partnership", on the basis of relevant initiatives.</p>
<p>The Commission has immediately started working on this. At this stage it can be said that the Commission's proposals will be based on the following principles:</p>
<p>a)	The European Neighbourhood Policy, based on bilateral, differentiated co-operation with each individual partner, remains the principal framework of the relations towards the EU's Eastern neighbours. That is also clearly what these partners want.</p>
<p>b)	The proposals should build upon, complement and add value to already existing structures, without duplicating what is being done and in particular, the Black Sea Synergy, established a year ago and which is now bearing fruit with concrete results on the ground.</p>
<p>c)	Any new multilateral framework must comprise all EU Member States so that the Union can deploy its full political and economic weight and partners become gradually closer to the Union as such.</p>

Mr Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, recently cautioned against this plan unless a comprehensive programme and clear commitments are first in place.</p>

<p>The prevention and eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment worldwide represents one of the main objectives of the EU’s human rights policy. In this context, the Commission is committed to continue its substantial support to the fight against torture under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). It doesn't plan to reduce its overall support in this area. For 2007-10, more than € 44 million have been allocated to that purpose. Such funding is fully consistent with its past funding.</p>
<p>The Commission does, however, intend to somewhat redirect EIDHR support to torture rehabilitation centres. Indeed, it plans to phase out gradually our support to centres in the EU from 2010 onwards, with a view of funding more torture rehabilitation centres outside the EU, where government and private support is often scarce or even non-existent. The Commission recalls that the EIDHR is an instrument dedicated to supporting non-governmental organization (NGO) projects outside the EU and that EU Member States have an obligation under EC and international law to provide assistance to torture victims. In April 2008, the Council recalled the importance of financial support for torture prevention and rehabilitation programmes and specifically called on Member States to support torture rehabilitation centres.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware of the potential consequences of this reorientation and has approached this issue with care. The Commission and Member States are committed to ensure that the phasing out will not be made at the cost of torture victims in the EU. To this aim, the Commission has already launched a process of consultations with stakeholders, including the relevant UN bodies and NGOs. It intends in the coming months, to take stock of current needs of torture victims and alternative forms of support in order to establish a comprehensive approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0564"></a>

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq are becoming test cases for international development assistance and multilateral cooperation and for the European Union in particular. For example, having regard to the Commission's National Indicative Programme, earmarking EUR 610 million for Afghanistan for 2007-2010, it is very important to find and implement a right balance between the spending on law enforcement and support for military operations, on the one hand, and on civil reconstruction and humanitarian assistance as well as on health and education, on the other.</p>
<p>What is envisaged by the Commission in this field? Is the EU financial assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq to be increased? What programmes and projects are to be financed in the upcoming three years? Does the Commission intend to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the EU financial assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq and keep the European Parliament adequately informed about the results of such evaluation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1.	The Commission clearly agrees on the importance of ensuring effective support for reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on the need for improvement in both the security situation and the welfare of their populations.</p>
<p>Most of the funds available for Afghanistan's Indicative Programme for the period 2007-2010 have been allocated to support reconstruction in rural development, governance and health. Education is supported through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, the Commission has unfortunately not yet been able to develop a multi annual indicative programme. Security, the volatile political situation and rapidly changing living conditions do not allow such multi-annual planning for the time being. Consequently, aid to Iraq has been provided until now through Special Measures. In 2008 the Commission proposes to allocate 85% of the € 72 million total to the provision of basic services to the population and to refugees, and the balance for technical assistance to the Iraqi institutions.</p>
<p>2.	The Country Strategy Paper for Afghanistan sets out the priorities for Community financial assistance for Afghanistan 2007-2013. For the period 2007-2010, €610 million has been allocated. In addition, Afghanistan benefits from support provided from thematic budget lines, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, humanitarian assistance and the Instrument for Stability.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, it is the common understanding of the Government of Iraq and the international community that donor support in the future should concentrate in improving the capacity of Iraqi institutions to make better use of Iraq's considerable financial resources. The Commission is therefore concentrating its support on the technical assistance to the Iraqi institutions and on the improvement of the basic services to the population.</p>
<p>3.	The Commission will propose, in the Annual Action Programme 2008 for Afghanistan support for Health (€ 60 million) Social Protection (€ 24 million), Justice Sector and Customs (€ 30 million) and Agriculture (€ 30 million). For 2009 programmes are expected to include funding for Governance, Rural Development, Mine Action and Regional Cooperation and in 2010 programmes for Health, Rural Development and Governance.</p>
<p>In the case of Iraq, given the absence of multi-annual programming, no programmes are foreseen for the moment for the next three years. For 2008, the Special Measure for Iraq will be presented to the Council and to Parliament in October 2008. It will follow the guidelines of the Information Note distributed to Parliament in June 2008.</p>
<p>4.	The Community's financial assistance to Afghanistan is being monitored and evaluated in a systematic way through field missions and visits, independent Result Oriented Monitoring missions, regular project reports, as well as through the Coordinated Donor Dialogue mechanism and steering committees with the Government. In the context of the Budgetary Discharge 2006 the Commission has confirmed its intention to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of aid in Afghanistan. A first 'State of Play' report is being published on the web and will be regularly updated.</p>
<p>In Iraq, two verification missions and one evaluation on the ground were performed during 2008. Their first results are positive. The final results and conclusions will be shared with the Parliament as soon as they are available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0572"></a>

<p>Following the “no” vote on the Lisbon Treaty in the Irish referendum in June 2008, the European Council examined the situation at its meeting on 19/20 June 2008.

<p>The Commission successfully completed negotiations with 11 of the 16 countries.

<p>Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters is applicable in all 27 Member States. With regard to Denmark, the Regulation is applicable since 1 July 2007 on the basis of an agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In October 2004, the Commission adopted a report on the application of the Regulation. The Report concluded that since its entry into force in 2001, the application of the Regulation had generally improved and expedited the transmission and the service of documents between Member States. The main reasons for the speeding up of transmission and service were the introduction of direct contacts between local bodies, the possibility of postal service and direct service and the introduction of standard forms. Nevertheless, many persons involved in the application of the Regulation, in particular local bodies, still did not have sufficient knowledge about the Regulation. Furthermore, the application of certain provisions of the Regulation is not fully satisfactory. Adaptations of these provisions should be considered in order to further improve and facilitate the application of the Regulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, in July 2005 the Commission proposed to amend certain provisions of the Regulation (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0305">COM(2005) 305</a>). On 13 November 2007, Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000. The new Regulation will enter into force on 13 November 2008.</p>
<p>The most important modifications with respect to Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 are:</p>
<p>Introduction of a rule providing that the receiving agency shall take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt.</p>
<p>Introduction of a new standard form to inform the addressee about his right to refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document to the receiving agency within one week.</p>
<p>Introduction of a rule providing that costs occasioned by recourse to a judicial officer or to a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed shall correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>Introduction of uniform conditions for service by postal services (registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent).</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007, the Commission will then publish the information communicated by Member States and an updated version of the manual and the glossary.</p>
<p>Art. 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 provides that the next report on the application of the Regulation will be presented no later than 1 June 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is not responsible for monitoring healthcare delivery in third countries.</p>
<p>As for the European Union, according to Article 152 of the Treaty, Member States are responsible for the organisation and delivery of health services on their territory, irrespective of whether healthcare is delivered to domestic patients or to foreign patients. This includes monitoring of results as well as quality and safety control.</p>
<p>Within its sphere of responsibilities, the Commission supports work leading to increased availability of data on the outcomes and quality of medical procedures in the European Union, through projects co-financed by the Public Health Programme.</p>
<p>For example, it supports the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Healthcare quality indicators project, focusing on cardiac care, diabetes care, mental health care, primary care and prevention, and patient safety. Other examples are the Euphoric project, aiming at benchmarking health outcomes and assessing quality of care of health procedures or the Hospital Data 2 (HPD2) project, improving the comparability and developing a time-series of hospital procedures.</p>
<p>As regards the case of "flying-in surgeons", Directive 2005/36/EC on recognition of professional qualifications provides for free provision of services whilst ensuring an appropriate level of qualification. Surgery belongs to the medical specialities for which the Directive ensures automatic recognition of diplomas based on minimum common standards at EU level.</p>
<p>In addition, without affecting the role of Member States in healthcare delivery, the European Community may contribute in the future to provide patients with better cross-border healthcare.</p>
<p>As regards healthcare provided in an EU Member State, the Commission proposed, on 2 July 2008, a Directive<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare which would, inter alia, clarify the responsibilities of Member States in relation to quality and safety of cross-border healthcare. A clear principle would be agreed: the Member State of treatment has the responsibility for the definition, enforcement and monitoring of quality and safety standards. This proposal also aims at improving data collection on cross-border healthcare. However it is the Member State of origin of the patient that shall determine which treatments will be eligible for reimbursement. Moreover, this proposed directive is without prejudice to the Directive 2005/36/EC on recognition of professional qualifications and implementing measures adopted by the Member States should not constitute new barriers to the free movement of health professionals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Pursuant to the third sentence of Article 106(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro, all banknotes denominated in euro have the status of legal tender. Although Article 11 of the Regulation defines the maximum number of coins that a party is obliged to accept, the Regulation does not set any limit on banknotes. The various banknotes denominated in euro are stipulated in a decision of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB).</p>
<p>There are no Community rules that explicitly provide for appealing against a refusal to accept certain banknotes. Different provisions may apply under the civil law and monetary law of the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that € 500 banknotes are sometimes refused as payment in certain shops in Belgium. However, this practice does not seem to be on the increase and it dates back to when the Belgian franc was in use, when the same thing happened with BEF 10 000 notes. Cases of € 500 banknotes being refused are also recorded in the other countries of the eurozone.</p>
<p>If a shopkeeper clearly informs his customers that he does not accept large banknotes as payment (for example in visible signs at the shop entrance and beside the checkout), the buyer is generally deemed to have entered into a contractual relationship with the seller and have tacitly agreed to the conditions set out.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0557"></a>

<p>After seven years of negotiation, right at the moment when success finally seemed within reach, Ministers meeting in Geneva in July 2008 could not finalise something in which the EU still believed and for which it had fought so much. It is too early now to assess the long-term consequences of this failure. What we know is that an agreement in Geneva would have brought benefits for Europe and its partners while boosting the economy of developing countries in a way which never occurred before, laying the foundations for enhanced trade and prosperity over the next decade.</p>
<p>Of course, new trade opportunities do mean greater competition and the challenge of adaptation – which is not always easy. It is important to ensure that this change is phased in: this is why the Doha round's provisions would have not been implemented overnight but over a number of years. It is also why in the area of agriculture, the EU has consistently rejected all over the negotiations the extreme liberalisation demands made by some World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states.</p>
<p>In the long run, the challenge of adaptation is worth taking, because the shift from less to more competitive sectors is critical to improving productivity and securing long-term growth. The Commission continues to believe that a successful conclusion of a multilateral agreement under the WTO is still the best way to achieve this objective and do so in a way that forces others to take similar steps.</p>
<p>The liberalisation and the lower tariffs inherent in a successful conclusion of such an agreement would inevitably mean lower tariffs for food products as well, but would also translate into cheaper food for consumers, and cheaper inputs for companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, all imported food products would continue to need to respect strict food safety rules comparable to those in place in the Community: the Commission can assure the Honourable Member that there will be no compromise on this crucial point. The Community has now a comprehensive legislative framework on food safety designed to ensure that all food is safe, irrespective of origin. The Commission is not going to jeopardise this.</p>
<p>A successful agreement would have also meant a level playing field for EU farmers and therefore more opportunities for European exports by opening new farm markets for European produce abroad. 70% of EU agricultural exports are finished consumer oriented products, for which there is a growing market in the world.</p>
<p>It is also very important that, through Doha, among great difficulties and opposition from many countries: the EU was trying to secure improved legal protection for what is called 'geographical indications', the special local agricultural products that are some of Europe's most competitive exports – things like Parma Ham and Roquefort cheese. It is also important to note that some form of commitment by our partners on this subject would have been a condition "sine qua non" for a final deal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0558"></a>

<p>In spite of the pledges made by the European Commission, the financial procedures for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development are even more complicated than those for previous framework programmes.

In other words, although the Commission had promised to speed up its internal financial procedures they will in fact take 80% longer.</p>

<p>The Commission has no indication that supports the statement in the question that there has been an increase of 80% in the time to process proposals. The average time-to-grant in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP6) was between 12 and 13 months. Detailed statistics for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7) are not yet available (because the processes are still ongoing) but estimations show that the average time-to-grant for the first wave of FP7 projects will probably be of the same order.</p>
<p>The legal framework of FP7 itself provides for simplification of grant negotiation. However both this legal framework and the Financial Regulation also impose limits to such simplification in the interest of providing adequate assurances and accountability.</p>
<p>The introduction of the guarantee fund leads to a considerable reduction of the number of ex-ante financial capacity checks. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, only coordinators and participants requesting more than € 500 000 have to be checked, meaning that nine out of ten participants will not be concerned by ex-ante financial capacity checks (in FP6 all participants had to be checked). This is particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups.</p>
<p>In addition, major investments were made at the start of FP7 into new systems and procedures like the unique registration facility and the new online negotiation system; both of which are now fully operational. The introduction of these new systems has indeed led to certain delays in negotiations of the first wave of grant agreements, but we are confident that these investments will pay off during the further course of FP7 and have an effect on shortening time-to-grant. The unique registration of legal entities is now an established process. As a result of the first wave of calls, more than 7000 entities are already registered in the central data base of validated entities and will not have to undergo this step in future calls, which will save a considerable amount of time and effort in grant negotiations. The new online Web tool for negotiations (NEF) is now fully up and running and allows an easy exchange of information between coordinators and project officers. More generally our efforts to improve information and guidance to potential beneficiaries will ensure better targeted, and better prepared, applications.</p>
<p>The process of processing and evaluating the many hundreds of thousands of applications received for the research programme is a complicated task requiring efficiency, rigour, independence and fairness. The new facility in Brussels which manages this process is already undertaking this task effectively. Commissioner responsible for Science and Research recently extended an invitation to members of the Budgetary Control Committee of Parliament to visit this facility in October 2008 to witness for themselves the process. This invitation is hereby extended also to the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0559"></a>

<p>In June 2008, an alarming study by the Catholic University of Louvain (UCL) was published concerning the health risks posed by electromagnetic radiation (mobile telephony, WIFI, antennae). The same month, writing in the French Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, 20 international scientists called for caution in the use of mobile telephones. In the '13th Progress Report on the Single European Telecoms Market 2007' (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2008&amp;nu_doc=0153">COM(2008)0153</a>), I do not find any reference to the relationship between consumers and health.

In the light of the precautionary principle, the scientists suggest 10 practical tips for users.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of concerns of the public about exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from mobile telephony. It is also informed about the recent recommendations from a French group of 20 personalities and the outcome of a recent experiment led by the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. The Commission is continuously monitoring international research on EMF in order to fulfil its role of protecting the public from potential adverse health effects of EMF.</p>
<p>The matter is covered by Directive 1999/5/EC<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which covers radio equipment and the related health risks. The harmonised standards adopted under this Directive apply to all equipment and installations mentioned in the Honourable Member's question. The values imposed in those standards are based on the values listed in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0-300 GHz), based on the best science available. Since 1999, the Commission has been monitoring its implementation regularly and has consulted several times its Scientific Committees to see whether it should be adapted in view of new scientific developments.</p>
<p>The recommendations of the French group are basic actions that can be taken easily by users to reduce exposure even more from the use of mobile phones if they so wish. As such, they are a sound way to apply a certain form of precaution.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) confirmed that for Radio Frequency (RF) fields, so far no health effect has been consistently demonstrated at exposure levels below the limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and proposed in the Council Recommendation. The opinions of the SCENIHR are public and available to the European Parliament. The SCENIHR is already updating its 2007 opinion upon request of the Commission and will take into account all new published research available.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to promote independent research in this area. The most recent call for proposals under the Environment theme of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research contains a topic on health impacts of RF exposure in children and adolescents.

<p>The Community provisions applicable distinguish between the conditions under which the goods enter the Community territory, as well as between customs duties, value added tax (VAT) and excise duties.</p>
<p>In case of a move from a third country, personal property is exempted from customs duties and VAT under certain conditions; notably, the goods must have been used at the former normal place of residence and must be intended to be used in the new normal place of residence, and the exemption does not apply to articles for use in the exercise of a trade or profession. The exemption does not extend to some specific goods, such as tobacco or tobacco products and alcoholic products. Tea however has no such special status and thus benefits from the exemption under the same conditions as other products. Excise duty on tea is subject to a different regime. Indeed, tea does not form part of the products to which harmonised excise duty applies. However, Community law does not prevent Member States either from levying excise duty on tea, nor does it provide for particular allowances in this field in the case of a move from a third country. Therefore, Member States levying excise duty on tea may in principle apply their national rules in the matter.</p>

Here, the principle is that goods contained in the personal luggage are exempted from value added tax, from excise duty and from customs duty, up to a certain monetary amount applicable to the totality of the goods in the personal luggage (so far 175€). However, some goods are, instead, subject to quantitative limits. This concerns first and foremost alcohol and tobacco products. However, as regards VAT and excise duties, quantitative limits also apply to perfume, coffee and tea. In the case of tea, the quantitative limit is 100 g. The extension to these three latter categories, adopted in 1969, was due to the fact that at the time, a considerable proportion of Member States levied excise duties on them. Today however, this regime no longer reflects the real pattern of taxation of excisable goods in the vast majority of the Member States. Therefore, the Commission proposed on 22 February 2006 to abolish the quantitative limits applicable to these three product categories<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This proposal was adopted by the Council on 20 December 2007<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As a consequence, tea will be treated as any other product and thus be subject only to the monetary limit applicable to the totality of goods contained in the personal luggage (value increased to 300€, and in the case of air and sea travellers to 430€). However, the new regime will only apply with effect from 1 December 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The principle of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice within which the free movement of persons is guaranteed is one of the founding principles of the Union.

<p>When it comes to family policy, the Commission’s aim is to simplify the citizens’ lives by implementing the programme for the mutual recognition of laws, acts and decisions. As stated during the hearing of the Commissioner responsible for justice, freedom and security on 16 June 2008, the Commission intends to begin work on the recognition of civil status acts and public acts legislation in the European Union, with a view in particular to enabling citizens’ marriages and partnerships to be taken into consideration in countries other than the one where these marriages or partnerships were entered into.

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that toys should fulfil the highest health and safety standards. There can be no compromise on the safety for children, the most vulnerable consumers. For this reason the Commission has initiated a wide range of legal and operational measures to ensure the highest level of safety of toys placed on the market in the Community.</p>
<p>On the basis of a Commission proposal of 14 February 2007 Parliament and the Council adopted on 9 July 2008 two legal acts on the marketing of products namely a Regulation setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and a Decision on a common framework for the marketing of products<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. These horizontal acts contain considerably higher requirements for product safety, including toys, such as enhanced obligations of economic operators, i.e. manufacturers and importers, for market surveillance, and for the treatment of detected unsafe goods. Their application will contribute to ensuring that toys entering the Community market are safe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission adopted on 25 January 2008 a proposal for a revised Directive on the Safety of Toys<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Commission proposal foresees to strengthened safety requirements for toys, in particular to deal with the recently identified hazards, such as chemicals in toys. The Commission proposal is now actively discussed in Parliament and in the Council. The Commission calls on Parliament to contribute to the ongoing work in order to reach a first reading agreement on this important initiative by the end of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Recently the European Commission brought infringement proceedings against Spain on the grounds that its domestic law discriminated against non-resident EU nationals in relation to property sales and capital gains tax. However this only applies for those people who sold their homes from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p>What is the Commission doing to help those EU citizens who sold their houses before 31 December 2006 and fell foul of the pre-2007 rule?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission decided to refer Spain to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty over its taxation of non-residents on capital gains realised on the sale of Spanish immovable property. The Commission considered that the Spanish tax legislation infringed the freedom of capital movement enshrined in the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>Under the previous Spanish legislation capital gains of non-resident individuals were taxed at a flat rate of 35%, whereas residents were subject to progressive taxation when the fixed assets remained within the possession of the taxpayer for less than one year, and to a flat rate of 15% when the assets were realised after one year of possession. Thus, non-resident individuals were always subject to a substantially higher tax burden if they sold their property after one year of possession, and were so in most cases, if the property was sold within a year after acquisition.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Spanish parliament approved a tax reform through Law 35/2006, of 28 November 2006, published in the Official Gazette of 29 November 2006. The reform entered into force on 1 January 2007. One of the most significant amendments concerning the taxation of capital gains was the introduction of a flat rate tax of 18% on any capital gains. The Commission considers that this amendment removed any future discrimination in this field between residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that there are many non-resident citizens who have suffered from the application of discriminatory rules in respect of capital gains that have often accrued over a considerable period of time, the Commission decided to continue the infringement procedure when the new legislation entered into force as this legislation does not provide for satisfactory arrangements in respect of such pre-existing cases. The Court of Justice will decide whether the previous Spanish tax legislation infringed the freedom of capital movement enshrined in the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>It should be noted that even if an infringement procedure under Article 226 EC Treaty is opened against a Member State, any subsequent finding of an infringement by the Court of Justice has no automatic or immediate impact on the procedural position of individual complainants, since the Court procedure does not serve to resolve individual cases. It merely obliges the Member State to amend its tax rules in line with Community law. National courts and administrative bodies are responsible for ensuring that the authorities of the Member States comply with Community law in individual cases. Therefore, if citizens consider a particular measure or administrative practice to be incompatible with Community law, they are advised to seek redress from national administrative or judicial authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0588"></a>

<p>The Commission can assure the Honourable Member that neither the television report he refers to, nor similar newspaper reports are correct.</p>
<p>At a meeting on 9 July 2008, the Commissioner for Competition informed the Minister of State Treasury of Poland that the draft restructuring plans for Gdynia Shipyard and Szczecin Shipyard that Poland submitted to the Commission on 26 June 2008 in the context of a State aid investigation, were not ensuring long-term viability of the two yards and did not comply with the conditions for the authorisation of State aid under the Community guidelines for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Following that meeting, press reports were published relating to a purported note of the meeting of 20 June 2008. This note was not produced by the Commission, and has not been seen, commented on or agreed by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission can confirm, however, that the press reports do not reflect the discussion that took place in the meeting of 20 June 2008.</p>
<p>At this meeting, Ulstein outlined its strategy for the restructuring of Szczecin Shipyard, and then asked a number of questions related to possible scenarios for the future of the ongoing State aid investigation. The Commission services therefore provided a comprehensive overview of possible scenarios for the development of the ongoing State aid investigation concerning Szczecin Shipyard. The Commission services explained the conditions for the authorisation of State aid under the Community guidelines for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty as well as the consequences should these conditions not be met. The Commission services explained that in the latter case, as in any case of unlawful and incompatible State aid granted by any Member State, the Commission would have to order recovery of the State aid granted. To the question of Ulstein on how the State aid recovery claim would affect the sale of assets in a bankruptcy procedure, should the recovery order indeed lead to bankruptcy, the Commission services responded by explaining the established Commission practice and the case-law of the European courts on the treatment of State aid recovery claims in bankruptcy procedures.</p>
<p>The responses of the Commission services were based on the Notice from the Commission “Towards an effective implementation of Commission decisions ordering Member States to recover unlawful and incompatible State aid”<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

The Commission services provided the Polish authorities present at the meeting and the representatives of Ulstein, on the request of the latter, with an explanation of the applicable Court jurisprudence and Commission case practice concerning the treatment of cases concerning rescue and restructuring State aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Does the Commission not consider that by establishing its own criterion on compatibility and disregarding the one used by the Member States it is violating the application of the subsidiarity principle provided for by Regulation ((EC) No 1580/2007, which reflects the Council's political agreement of June 2007?

<p>The political agreement on the fruit and vegetable market reform of June 2007 foresees specific provisions in relation to the coexistence of actions implemented under the operational programmes set out by the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for fruit and vegetables and measures implemented under the rural development programmes.</p>
<p>The principle of complementarity, i.e. specific provisions on coexistence, is foreseen by the rural development regulation. Also the implementing regulations of the Commission in the fruit and vegetable sector refer to that principle.</p>
<p>These provisions state as a general rule that no support can be granted under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to schemes that are eligible for support under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. However, where support under the rural development fund is exceptionally permitted for measures falling within the scope of common market organisations, such as the common organisation for fruit and vegetables, Member States shall ensure that a beneficiary may receive support for a given operation only under one scheme.</p>
<p>In order to provide this assurance, Member States shall describe in their rural development programmes the criteria and the administrative rules they will apply for these exceptions. A number of Member States had already defined such criteria and administrative rules when they prepared their rural development programmes for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>Where criteria and administrative rules have already been approved as part of the rural development programmes 2007-2013, Member States have to amend their programmes in order to take account of new rules introduced under the fruit and vegetables reform in relation to the National Framework for environmental actions and the National Strategy for operational programmes in the fruit and vegetable sector. Therefore, it is the Commission's view that the subsidiarity principle has been fully respected.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Water is an irreplaceable and indispensable natural resource which, regrettably, is not available to all. According to a report by Transparency International, corruption in the water sector is the principal cause of the world water crisis which is threatening millions of lives and aggravating environmental problems. The report mentions problems from small-scale bribery connected with the supply of water to fraud involving funds for irrigation and dams, concealment of industrial pollution and the manipulation of policy on water management and allocation. According to the report, the influence of corruption on water is insufficiently recognised in development aid and food and energy supply. Yet it should be recognised, as more than one billion people worldwide have no guaranteed access to water and more than two billion people have no access to adequate sanitation.</p>
<p>The Commission has always been very committed to combating all forms of corruption.

<p>The EU takes an extremely firm stance on this matter of corruption in the water sector, and views corruption as a major obstacle to achieving development goals.</p>
<p>The EC sees corruption as a symptom of poor governance and of a lack of transparent, accountable management and control systems. Corruption can not be tackled in isolation but needs to be integrated into development and poverty reduction strategies and into support to the processes of democratic governance. This means strengthening the role of civil society and the media, as well as protection for multiparty democracy and electoral competition.</p>
<p>The Commission has been participating – without being a member - in annual meetings of the Water Integrity Network (WIN), formed in 2006, which promotes increased awareness and understanding of corruption issues related to water. Transparency International is one of the founders of the network and the Commission is aware of its recent report.</p>
<p>In this context in the last two years the Commission has introduced the Governance Profile under the European Development Fund (EDF) 10, which enables an in-depth analysis of service delivery and governance of aid programming - including projects in the water sector - to address these issues. The new format of Country Strategy Papers for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries locates the analysis of the questions related to the governance in the broader context of the analysis of the political situation and provides useful information on this subject. The aim is to facilitate the link between the analysis and the response strategy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is introducing a sector governance analysis framework encompassing the water sector. The framework analyses and addresses the issue of bad governance in our interventions and that includes the problem of corruption. In the water sector, the Commission is taking practical steps towards broader participation of local actors and the accountability through the promotion of integrated water resources management (IWRM). For 2007-2013, approximately € 180 million will be dedicated to IWRM worldwide through the EDF and the Community Budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0597"></a>

<p>Unfortunately, the question of the rules governing the use of driftnets in the European Union needs to be addressed once more. In the light of the decision adopted by the Commission banning the use of driftnets for salmon fishing in the Baltic, the latest legislative proposal from the Council and Commission is surprising in that it authorises the use in other EU waters of driftnets up to 100 kilometres long, together with a 5% shark by-catch, whereas nearly all shark species are protected. Will the Commission therefore answer the following question, which I have asked many times before:</p>
<p>Why is the use of driftnets not authorised in the Baltic, when there is no evidence of significant porpoise by-catches? This is totally inconsistent on the part of the Commission and is tantamount to discrimination between different fishing grounds.</p>
<p>How can EU legislation be reconciled with the United Nations ban on the use of long pelagic driftnets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The ban on the use of driftnets in EU waters has not changed and is clearly justified. When using driftnets, some cetacean bycatches such as porpoises or dolphins occur. Since no proven efficient technical solution has yet been identified, the only way to avoid such cetacean bycatches is to prohibit the use of driftnets.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted in June 2008 a proposal for new technical measures in the Atlantic and the North Sea. The main objectives of that revision were a simplification of the current rules which at times are too complex and too difficult to understand, along with a harmonisation of the main provisions, taking into account the distinctive regional nature of fisheries in those waters. In that proposal, there is no authorisation whatsoever for the use of driftnets which are and shall continue to be prohibited. There are some rules on the use of bottom set gillnets including a ban on using gillnets in depths of over 200 metres so as to reduce discards and catches of sharks. Nevertheless, the proposal allows the use of gillnets in depths of up to 600 metres where hake or monkfish are targeted.</p>
<p>In the Baltic Sea, the driftnet ban is a necessary conservation measure in line with the Community's Fisheries and Environmental Laws and with the existing international obligations for the protection and the recovery of harbour porpoises. In the last century, the incidental entanglements of harbour porpoises in fishing gears and particularly in driftnets were identified as one of the key factors behind the strong decline of the harbour porpoise population in the Baltic Sea. Whereas, harbour porpoises were present over the whole of the Baltic Sea in the past, they are today only found in the western part of the sea. Harbour porpoises are considered an endangered species and are listed under the Natura 2000 European Habitats Directive. Over the last ten years there have not been any signs of recovery according to the most recent assessments that have been made, although, there were still significant porpoise bycatches being reported within the Polish driftnet fisheries for salmon, over the last decade.</p>
<p>In contrast with the measures taken in other Community waters, the Baltic driftnet fishery was only banned with effect from 2008 instead of 2002, and only after a gradual adaptation period and the provision of financial support for fishermen to adapt to the ban and to change fishing gears.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0599"></a>

<p>The Commission would point out to the Honourable Member that it is not in a position to comment on statistical data produced by the International Labour Organisation, but can refer only to data produced by Eurostat<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Under Articles 136 and 137 of the EC Treaty, the European Community has competence to adopt legislation and take action to make improvements, in particular in the working environment, to ensure a higher level of protection of the safety and health of workers.</p>
<p>On that basis an extensive body of Community legislation has been developed with the overall aim of protecting workers' health and safety.</p>
<p>The central piece of legislation concerned is the Framework Directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work<span class="sup"> </span><a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It aims inter alia to introduce or improve preventative measures to safeguard the health and safety of workers and ensure a higher degree of protection (Recital 10).</p>
<p>The Framework Directive's scope is wide: in accordance with Article 2(1), it applies to all sectors of activity, both public and private (industrial, agricultural, commercial, administrative, service, educational, cultural, leisure, etc.).</p>
<p>Article 14 of the Framework Directive makes it an obligation to ensure that workers receive health surveillance appropriate to the health and safety risks they incur at work. Article 15 stipulates that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member's attention is also drawn to the fact that the Community strategy (2007-12) for health and safety at work provides that 'National and EU policies should help to create working environments and occupational health services which enable workers to play a full and protective part in working life until they reach old age.'<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>As regards the retirement age, the Commission would like to recall that the 2001 Stockholm European Council has agreed to set an EU target for increasing the average EU employment rate of men and women in the 55-64 age-group in the EU to 50% by 2010. The 2002 Barcelona European Council concluded that 'A progressive increase of about 5 years in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union should be sought by 2010.'<a href="#defann_54_4" name="refann_54_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the aims of the EU's employment and social affairs policy is accordingly to improve working conditions at every workplace in order to obtain a continuous, sustainable reduction of occupational accidents and diseases and to maximise the ability of individuals to work and so prevent early withdrawal from the labour market.</p>
<p>For these reasons, developing the concept of arduous, unhealthy work would not be in line with the objectives of the EU policy concerned as the approach is to achieve a healthy and safe working environment by means of prevention and improving working conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The residents of the Assiros district of the province of Lagkadas situated in the prefecture of Thessaloniki are expressing great concern and are organising active protests in response to the projected Mavrorachi landfill site, an integrated waste management centre which is in danger of becoming a common dumping ground because of failure to carry out the necessary works. The seven waste transfer (WTS) the two recycling centres and the biological purification plant have not yet been completed. Responsibility for this lies with the authorities who have for decades been simply using the Tagarades waste disposal centre in the prefecture of Thessaloniki without building any landfill sites equipped with the necessary infrastructures to protect public health and the environment. When the Tagarades waste disposal centre ceases to operate within a few days, this will greatly increase the problems facing the residents of Thessaloniki, ever more so in the Assiros district.</p>
<p>How safe is the Mavrorachi landfill site, given that the abovementioned works, which are necessary to protect public health and the local environment have not been carried out?

<p>Through Decision C(2002)4710 of 27 December 2002, as amended by Decision C(2008)3823, the Commission decided to grant Community assistance under the Cohesion Fund to the project for a ‘Waste disposal centre in the north-west zone of Thessaloniki and access road’. This project relates solely to the construction of the waste disposal centre and the related works as well as the access road. The final date for the eligibility of the expenditure is 31 December 2009.</p>
<p>Some of the actions mentioned by the honourable Member are actions envisaged by the Regional solid waste management plan and are not cofinanced by the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>As regards the work envisaged by the abovementioned Decision, the competent Greek authorities (Management authority of the ‘Central Macedonia’ operational programme) have informed the Commission that the test period for the operation of the landfill site (HYTA) situated in Mavrorahi, cofinanced by the Cohesion Fund, began on 7 June 2008 and will last for a period of five months. It should be noted that this test began after the completion of the work on the two waste recycling centres and the related infrastructure work as well as the site access road.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the information provided by the Greek authorities, the entire project as described in the Decision is due to be completed within the deadlines laid down in the Decision, including the construction of the leachate treatment plant.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities confirm that the additional work envisaged by the Regional solid waste management plan does not have any impact on the operation of the Mavrorahi landfill site. The completion of the network of waste transfer sites affects the way in which the waste is transported, not the operation of the site. The two waste recycling centres in Tagarades and Thermi are operational but have not yet achieved full capacity, while the Eukarpia centre is in the process of obtaining its environmental permit. Finally, according to the Greek authorities, the leachate treatment plant does not affect the operation of the landfill site since the plant should be completed by the time leachate production begins.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0609"></a>

<p>The effectiveness of aid provided by the Commission has been a subject of both internal and external evaluation. The aid effectiveness agenda as known today was launched with the Paris declaration of 2005 which included targets to be achieved and indicators to measure progress. Signatories to the Paris Declaration agreed on a Joint Venture on Monitoring Implementation. The results of the latest survey are currently being finalised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and will be presented at the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra in September 2008.</p>
<p>Tentative results from the survey data show that in the 33 partner countries, which participated in both surveys (2006 and 2008), the Commission made progress in the field of capacity building (better coordination of technical assistance and less use of parallel project implementation units), alignment with priorities of partner countries, predictability of aid and coordination of field missions and analytical work with other donors. Outstanding challenges remain increasing the use of country systems (for public finance management and procurement) and the use of common arrangements and procedures by increased use of program based approaches. The survey also shows that investment in public finance management systems in partner countries is paying off, as one third of countries have improved their systems. Furthermore, a quarter of partner countries were able to improve the quality of their national development strategies, and nearly one fifth of the countries were able to improve the related result based monitoring frameworks.</p>
<p>Measuring the effectiveness of aid is a medium to long term process and the next comprehensive review by the international community will take place at the Fourth High Level Forum in 2011. At this point, it can be better established whether the 2010 targets set by the development community in Paris have been achieved, and what the impact has been of more effective aid (by applying the Paris commitments) on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth.</p>
<p>In 2007, the OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducted an extensive peer review of aid provided by the Community which recognised the Commission's leading role in the aid effectiveness debate and included important recommendations in the areas of budget support, use of parallel implementation units, untying of aid and the relationship with civil society.</p>
<p>According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, GDP in developing countries has grown substantially in recent years: between 2000 and 2008 there has been an annual growth of between 3.8 and 7.9% for the group of "emerging and developing economies". For sub-Saharan Africa, a region consisting entirely of developing countries, the same figures are 3.8 and 6.8%. Clearly, country-situations differ substantially from one another.</p>
<p>There is extensive research and an ongoing debate about exactly to what extent aid assists in ensuring economic growth (see for example Dollar, Collier: "Aid Allocation and Poverty Reduction", JavaScript:WinOpen();" </p>
<p>). Aid helps release constraints to growth in many different ways. How immediate this influence is depends on many factors. For example, a country's development strategy might be directed more towards private sector development and building up productive capacity. In such cases, expected effect on economic growth would be more direct. Similarly, resources can be directed, for example, to health and education which, over the longer term, would have an expected positive effect on economic growth.</p>
<p>In any case, there can be no doubt that effective aid is more conducive to assisting economic growth than poor quality aid which overburdens partners with large transaction costs. While improving aid effectiveness, implementing actions and changing behaviour, including new arrangements in administrating aid, will, inevitably, take time, some elements of the aid effectiveness agenda should have a more direct influence on economic growth. Improving public financial management capacity by partner countries, for example, should have a beneficial effect on investments. Moreover, untying of aid should provide more possibilities to providers from developing countries to provide and develop their expertise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0611"></a>

Interpretation into all the participants' languages is an issue of democratic importance at expert meetings. Difficult and crucial expert discussions are currently being held on the ECJ judgments in the Laval, Viking and Rüffert cases, in which freedom of movement comes up against the protection of workers’ rights.
