I would like to inform and at the same time reassure the Members who have just spoken on this important and serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to them that the College of Quaestors has acted in accordance with the precautionary principle. In fact, if the College of Quaestors had not ordered an air quality check in these buildings, the problem would not even have been mentioned today in plenary. This check has therefore been carried out and, as you know, it proved negative on two points. We took the necessary steps immediately, namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed. After technical changes had been made, we carried out a second air quality check, the results of which are available for asbestos. The second check did not reveal any more asbestos fibres, suggesting that they had been brought in from outside, or could well have been. We are quite certain that asbestos was not used to construct the building.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a second check has been carried out for the ducts contaminated with legionella bacteria, but the results of this are not available yet for purely technical reasons, as well as biological reasons, because the cultures take about a fortnight to mature. At any rate, the results of this second check will be available by the start of the next part-session in Strasbourg, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that if they should be positive, i.e. if these pathogenic elements are found to be still present, then the College of Quaestors will advise the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents to take the necessary action.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore no cause for alarm at present. We shall wait for the results of these checks and we shall take the necessary steps in accordance with the precautionary principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Minutes state that Mr Medina Ortega ‘questioned whether the letter from the committee’s chairman truly reflected the opinion of the committee as a whole’. What I said was that the letter read out by the President and sent by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi was not the opinion of the committee. It had not been adopted by the committee and therefore was not its opinion. It is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee’s opinion: reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Minutes then state that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ‘confirmed that the letter faithfully reflected the committee’s position’. Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is not here but, if I remember rightly, what she said was something along the lines of it being her opinion of what had taken place in committee, although it had not been adopted by the committee. Although I am aware that I am splitting hairs here, I should like to make it clear that what I said was that it was not the committee’s opinion and that, in some way, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi acknowledged that it was her opinion of what happened in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the two half truths could be turned into two complete truths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Duff, yesterday a vote was taken in the House on the Buitenweg report, as a result of which, the Karamanou and Sörensen reports have to be put to the vote this morning. This is also the reason why Mrs Buitenweg, who is otherwise requesting a quorum on this, is nobly expressing her reservation because she knows that voting on these reports this morning is the fair thing to do. In this respect, Mr Duff’s request might have been overlooked among the large number of requests made. He has not been given any information, which explains why he has made this request now. I would therefore urge Andrew to withdraw his request, since Mrs Buitenweg and others want a vote to be taken on the Sörensen and Karamanou reports this morning.</p>

I have also agreed to do this with the member of the PPE Group who works as a coordinator in our committee, since the PPE has proposed two amendments, although only for the legislative resolution. The text of the resolution itself should be rejected. However, I would urge a vote to be taken on the legislative resolution, together with both amendments, in which it is pointed out that we invite the Council to put forward a new draft text. The present text should therefore be rejected and the Council invited in the legislative resolution to submit a new text. It therefore comes down to the rather unusual process of the text which is actually to be voted on being rejected, but a vote then having to be taken on the legislative resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution states that 500 000 people, victims of trafficking in women, enter Europe every year. The true responsibility for trafficking in women lies with the men who take advantage of them in Europe – in the order of 180 million people, according to my calculations. The point I am trying to make in this explanation of vote can also be found on page 11, line 14 of the report, and it is the only line out of the 722 making up the report which reaches the crux of the matter: it states that we must fight for “information and awareness-raising activities with a view to reducing the demand side”.

And once again, Parliament responds to this by using an incoherent form of language whose repetition is discouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, whilst the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities rightfully condemns trafficking in women and children as an intolerable violation of basic human rights, at the same time it denounces what it considers to be the disastrous effects of the prohibition of prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">But are the measures which we are rightfully calling for from national and Community institutions any good if we politicians fail to proclaim, beforehand, that this truly basic right to human dignity is being violated by sexual exploitation, particularly prostitution?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take advantage of the fact that Parliament is presently involved in the work of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to think about the direction we want this to take. Is it about proclaiming a vision of the human being, and the sacredness and intrinsic dignity thereof, or recognising the rights of individuals in isolation and of separate impenetrable communities?</p>
<p class="contents">I will be told in reply that prostitution has always existed and that we should instead try to limit the damage it does. This scourge, like so many others, has certainly always existed and regrettably will no doubt always exist, but our task as elected representatives forces us to take a better and wider perspective, regarding what destroys the human being not as an inevitability but as a crime to be combated. The libertarian decriminalisation measures have proved to be inefficient and dangerous no matter what the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind some of my colleagues of the role played by these laws: by prohibiting certain practices, they set limits intended to protect those persons, male and female, who for different reasons are easy targets for criminal networks which exploit, and prosper on, their poverty. If these laws are not enough to break up the networks, then we must also provide the competent authorities with the means to conduct a campaign which is all the more efficient since it will be supported by unambiguous legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The unspeakable excesses of some people are often a sign of some distress which must also be put right. It is criminal to use the weakness of certain individuals to promote a libertarian ideology which spreads distress further afield and ultimately smells of death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, all the proclaimed rights, protective measures and international cooperation are only any good if they are inspired by the higher fundamental principles which they are intended to serve. It would therefore be useful for us to start by solemnly reasserting that the dignity of all human beings is at stake here, and that any compromise with practices violating this is irresponsible and criminal.</p>

<p class="contents">It is essential that, in Member States and in any cooperation between them, the basic principles of human dignity regain a central place, and are promoted and defended by policies to protect victims and prosecute those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that an ambitious development aid policy is implemented beforehand. This must be concerned with offering poor countries the means to develop, so that they can give their inhabitants the chance of a decent life: this process has an economic facet, but also in particular cultural and educational aspects. Admittedly, there is a constant demand for what is called ‘the sex industry’, but we must try to prevent adults from selling themselves or their children to such networks because it is the only means of meeting their needs. It is particularly through educating young people as well as adults that these people will be able to create their own means of subsistence in their respective regions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also up to us to create in our own countries the legal and social frameworks necessary for helping the victims and fighting against a scourge all too often presented as an inevitability or even a quaint tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title3"></a><a name="creitem3"></a>

They will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the European Union must strengthen its presence in such regional organisations, in those that already exist and in those that may be created in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in terms of human and technical resources, the European Commission is, in our opinion, currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve, or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet. NAFO is an exception and has perhaps become the best attended, most regulated and most monitored organisation of them all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that the Commission is paying greater attention to some of these organisations, as in the case of the ICCAT. This is certainly an organisation that is no stranger to pressure from this House and, more specifically, from our Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a number of other organisations – to mention only those that relate to the tuna species – and, alongside the aforementioned Atlantic tuna organisation, there is a pressing need for our presence in, and commitment to, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC, the Inter-American Commission for Tropical Tuna, the IATTC, or the MHLC, the Multilateral High Level Conference, which is negotiating the convention that will govern the Western Pacific Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission needs to have an effective presence, both in terms of human and technical resources, in all these organisations and, as I said, in those that may be created in the future. Parliament will help, and we shall spare no effort in ensuring that, in such organisations, the European Union has a level of influence that corresponds to our fisheries sectors. These sectors are calling for such an influence in view of third countries which, incidentally, sometimes defend their interests more vigorously than we defend ours.</p>
<p class="contents">NAFO has served as a model in many cases. The regulation we are now considering represents an attempt to incorporate decisions adopted by the organisation in 1997, 1998 and 1999 into Community legislation to make our internal measures more effective. In this case, we are dealing with the thorny issue of trying to ensure that vessels which are not part of the organisation respect the rules laid down by regional fisheries organisations. Such vessels, whether operating under flags of convenience or not, simply act freely whilst others respect provisions on the conservation of resources and, of course, contribute to these respective laws.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the measures drawn up, measures which are still scarce and difficult to apply, but which will continue to increase the world’s awareness of responsible fishing and trade and make such awareness more effective. The measures suggested by this House’s Committee on Fisheries are along these lines. They are measures which clarify some concepts to ensure greater accuracy and improve, as far as possible, upon the already significant control measures in NAFO waters.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, a Community vessel that was operating in NAFO waters, the Santa Mafalda, has been ordered into the Portuguese port of Aveiro with Canadian NAFO inspectors on board. Whilst we await the findings of the port inspection, we ask everyone to comply with the NAFO fisheries’ regulatory measures. These measures on the conservation of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Canadian authorities to behave in accordance with NAFO control measures and not to exceed their authority. During the plenary sitting on this matter, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President of the Commission, acknowledged that they had exceeded their duties in appropriating the ship’s documentation without the authorisation of the captain of the vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">Attitudes such as these remind us of a time we thought we had left behind, a time when Canada created a crisis, which we do not wish to see repeated under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we ask for a forceful response from the European Commission to Canada over their behaviour and – I should like to stress this and then conclude – we ask everyone to behave appropriately in order to conserve resources and we ask them to comply strictly with the rules laid down by NAFO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be quite frank, the owners of these vessels are stealing fish. They deliberately refuse to join NAFO, of which the European Union is a member. They think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known for a long time what kind of problems the fishing industry as a whole has to contend with. Overfishing certainly plays an important part in this regard. What we therefore need, at the end of the day, is a coherent fishing policy, not just in our waters, but worldwide, where all parties act in concert and cannot play their own game. This concerns everyone: the international community, individual countries and the European Union. NAFO is therefore more important than you would think for everyone, and not just for the European Union. The consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous, particularly for cod and redfish, two highly valued sources of food. Regulations – that is, either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing – have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s. In spite of all the efforts even simply to make these often stateless vessels comply with the protective and conservation measures, fishing continues to proceed unabated.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for the European Union was previously the lack of a unified system of control when checking vessels of non-contracting parties in EU ports because they are obviously not subject to Community law. By transferring the NAFO regulations as international law directly into Community law which is in force in all EU Member States, the regulation presently under discussion thus gains importance. The NAFO regulations – and their assimilation in a unified system – which control and, if necessary, sanction the non-contracting parties and their frequently stateless vessels and fishing, are therefore the most important matter dealt with in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who took part in a psychological study which exists in Germany, and which is appropriately named the ‘Fishing Game’, always headed for a resources catastrophe when they acted in isolation. In the final analysis, every one of them always took whatever was still left and this could no longer be replaced at the end. If we do not want to just have the choice between unreliable sources of food or unreliable fishing, then a functional form of cooperation between all the parties involved would be in our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of NAFO, and with a large number of Member States of its own, the EU fulfils the requirements for this. We therefore welcome this initiative, but would like a few minor points to be clarified in our motions in order to achieve greater coherency between NAFO and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word on this interesting term ‘international law‘. EU law also has its origins in international law. Certainly, we must now realise that EU Community law has become a term in its own right, and that this must be analogous to the evolving definition of the term ‘European Union’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we are to maintain the balance in this important organisation – and in what is an extremely important fishing ground for the Community fleet – then the only way to do so is for everyone to behave responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation under discussion today, on control measures for vessels from countries which are non- Contracting Parties to NAFO, is very much linked to this sense of responsibility that is so necessary in the fisheries sector. I am referring to the responsibility we all share for managing marine resources, in accordance with rules accepted by all parties to guarantee that such resources are preserved and that ours will not be the last generation to see cod, redfish or American plaice.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional fishing organisations have played an increasingly important role over recent years in the management of resources. In this respect, we, the Socialists, would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility. Legal philosophies dating from times gone by have been left behind, times when man felt how small he was in relation to the immensity of the Earth, which appeared to be a planet with infinite resources. The lack of ownership of the seas and the principle that the sea belongs to no one sprang from such ideas. However, nowadays, in a world that is becoming ever smaller, a world dominated by new technologies that make the world even smaller and with resources we know are becoming more and more scarce, we, the Socialists would like to move forward on the principle that the sea belongs to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, we would like NAFO to be – and indeed it is – an organisation open to countries that have vessels operating in this area. In this way, such countries would play a part in creating regulatory measures and would share responsibility for managing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">If this does not happen, flags of convenience, euphemistically known as ‘non-Contracting Parties’, will benefit, not to mention the piracy which lies behind the euphemism, ‘stateless vessels’. Such vessels – which we are often keen to believe have nothing to do with us – do not come from remote southern seas, but rather almost always originate from European ports, from Community ports. They fly strange flags and their aim is to practise social dumping. In so doing, they avoid regulations on the rational management of resources and pay no attention to workers’ social rights. People who idolise the market should note from this that neither fish nor people gain anything from their hypotheses.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is extremely important that countries with vessels operating in NAFO waters are Contracting Parties, just as it is important that the European Community is also a Contracting Party to regional organisations being set up in the South Atlantic and beyond the area the Community fleet currently operates in. Our fleet, the Community fleet, does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet, as a fleet without nationality, nor as an intruding fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to state that it wholeheartedly agrees with the content of this report although it regrets, as does the rapporteur himself, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, that there is a lack of proposed measures from the Commission on combating the main enemy of our fleet and of the conservation of fishery resources today. This enemy is none other than those vessels flying flags of convenience.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – I would very much like to support this report. It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties. The reality of the situation is that "vessels from non-contracting parties" usually means vessels flying flags of convenience or flags obtained from countries which have open registers. These are countries which will allow shipowners the right to fly their flag if they pay the country a fee. Under international law, it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations; for example, conservation measures, safety and labour standards, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules, and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like. They can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it. All the shipowner has to do is pay a bit of money to the country to get the flag which will allow him to fish with impunity. This really has to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of these countries is very long, but the traditional ones are Belize, Panama, Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Many of these vessels have been active in the NAFO area, but that is not the only place where they operate. Very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the Atlantic where the regional organisation is ICAT. ICAT has done more than any other regional organisation to try and combat fishing by flags of convenience. Most dramatically – and this is something that other people should take their lead from – is that it has now imposed import bans on bluefish tuna from one of its own members, Equatorial Guinea. ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations like ICAT and NAFO cannot solve the problem on their own. The responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Many shipowners like to use flags of convenience for it lets them get away with just about anything. There is no way of enforcing the law. The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags; they turn a blind eye and do not care. This is why it is so popular. The EU is among the worst in this sense.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Lloyd's Maritime Services, in December 1999 there were 1,323 vessels over 24 metres flying flags of convenience. Of these, 168 were owned by companies based in EU Member States. By far the worst, of course, and not surprising, is Spain with 116 vessels, but of course they are not alone. Each country tends to have their preferred flag use. For instance, the French vessels tend to use flags of Réunion, St Vincent and the Seychelles. For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama. The Dutch use Belize and St Vincent and 4 vessels, of course, from my own country are flagged in Belize as well. The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize. It is not surprising that Belize is there, considering last year’s revelations about Michael Ashcroft, the Tory Party treasurer’s business connections there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Panama and many others. The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan, with 117, which just beats Spain into first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, the Commission was actually trying to do something; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers. The Council refused. It wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules, and that is not acceptable. At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public's attention. For the past two weeks, Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna, flying these flags of convenience. They have also found a transport vessel, flagged in Panama and owned in Japan, both contracting parties to ICAT by the way, which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize. This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it. The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have often voiced my opinion that NAFO fishing grounds are undoubtedly among the most regulated in the world. Such vigilance is sometimes the result of excessive mistrust, on the part of some Contracting Parties – who have almost unlimited power in NAFO - towards other parties who operate completely legitimately.</p>
<p class="contents">We all remember the unjust and regrettable incidents that took place a few years ago, regarding a Community vessel. These incidents were the product of suspicion bordering on persecution which has often concealed a desire to throw a smoke screen around management errors in some coastal states.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I must applaud the fact that this proposal aims at incorporating into Community legislation three NAFO recommendations on controlling activities of vessels of non-Contracting Parties, and in particular non-Contracting Parties whose activities are, without a shadow of a doubt, much more suspect than those of any Community fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">As is usual procedure when discussing the transposition of measures into Community law, I must once again express my disappointment over the Commission’s delay in starting to work on adapting legislation. If it is indeed true that the proposal covers NAFO’s latest recommendations on sightings and transhipments from its annual meetings in 1998 and 1999, it is also true to say that this represents nothing more than a reworking of the 1997 recommendation, which is only now being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides this now traditional complaint, this proposal for a regulation represents an opportunity to debate the real problem of flags of convenience and discuss what the European Union is doing to deal with them. Given the current state of marine resources, and at a time when there is growing awareness of the need for real protection of marine ecosystems, the fight against illegal fishing must become a priority and vessels flying flags of convenience should be first on the list.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives. The first step must be to propose unified and clear measures in the fight against such activity to Member States. The aim of such common rules is to ban the flying of such flags and stop Member States allowing these fleets to dock in their ports. Currently, not all Community ports are aware that, directly or indirectly, they are often providing cover for illegal activity. We can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue. It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union. There is a growing understanding of the efforts that the European Union is making, and I would say that for the many years during which the Common Fisheries Policy has existed, the Union has failed, to a large extent, to convince the European public of the importance of the role it has been playing in trying to establish the facts of marine life, to provide the public with the scientific information and to take the necessary action.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations. In spite of these efforts, something like 80% of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures before us may be the best that we can manage, but they seem rather weak and hardly sufficient to achieve what we want. We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products. We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade. It is not just a matter of protecting our interests, because stocks outside our 200-mile limit can be affected by our activities. Stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it. There is also the whole question of our obligation to protect this resource that belongs to mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea. I do not think that individuals should have the right, just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region, to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances. We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly – they are already doing this in New Zealand. The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it. There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are, to get them, and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, the aim of the regulation is to implement at Community level a very important NAFO scheme intended to counteract non-contracting party activities which risk undermining the effectiveness of NAFO conservation measures. In this context, I should stress that the Community, as a contracting party to NAFO, has every interest in measures that help to resolve problems caused by states which do not discharge their cooperation and conservation obligations under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the proposed amendments, I should stress the following. Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary. In fact, recital 3 of the version proposed by the Commission is correct because we are actually dealing with the practice of using non-contracting party vessels. What is more, this wording is drawn from the language used in other legal texts, for instance the Council decision concerning the approval by the Community of the FAO compliance agreement and the Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 is relevant and will be taken on board. Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission. There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels. If it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels, there is no need to regulate. Furthermore, the terms "proceed to a formal sighting" can be construed as an obligation for the Community inspection vessel to direct itself towards non-contracting party vessels in order to make a sighting formal. Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks, which is certainly not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that what I have had to say has contributed to a better understanding and thank you again for the time and effort you have put into this proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that such unanimity leads them to reconsider their position on these two amendments that you said you would not adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, regarding the report we are currently debating, I should like to point out that the specific aim of these technical measures is to protect juveniles of marine organisms in order to reduce the threat to future yields. As a result, alongside the Commission, we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources. As you know, such measures include rules on the size of fishing gear, – and of meshes in particular – minimum allowable landing sizes, specific closed areas, protection of endangered species and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The governing Regulation No 850/98 entered into force on 1 January of this year, but it must obviously continue to be periodically adapted to incorporate any new data and scientific innovations which may emerge. In the case we are currently dealing with, we are discussing the fifth amendment which will enable the Commission to include various new measures that, in our opinion, are fully justified. We are talking about nets for shrimp fishing, closed areas for fishing for sand eels and a review of the minimum size for certain bivalve molluscs and crustacea. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable. However, in the newly added case of deepwater rose shrimp, the carapace length of 24 millimetres seems excessive and could cause problems for fishermen. As a result, your rapporteur has introduced an amendment, which has already been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, suggesting a compromise of setting this restriction at 22 millimetres. This compromise, of course, has already been agreed with the Member States as being more appropriate. We also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres, which has been widely called for by the sector, is a very positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is now a question of adapting certain measures that will have a positive impact on economic and social spheres whilst strictly respecting scientific reports.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it is essential that this regulation is kept up to date and that it is based on the best available scientific recommendations. This will not be the last amendment made given that there will be a continuing need to adapt to specific conditions and to scientific reports that emerge in the future. For this reason, with this amendment – which I think should be taken into consideration – we accept the overall proposal from the Commission and I hope that the Commission will in turn accept our amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A short while ago, we were still dealing with measures within the sphere of NAFO. We will now depart from the subject of offshore fishing in the ocean and go into detail on fishing in EU waters. It is not always just whales and seals which the public wants protected, and which attract, without doubt, greater attention from them. No, we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute. Who as a child has ever taken a carpetshell (<span class="italic">venerupis polastra</span>) in his arms as he would a soft toy? We certainly have a heart for children, but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving. We are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must protect the periphyton of marine organisms now in order to preserve all species. The regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one. In fact, it is being amended again today for the fifth time. In view of the developing populations, however, it must be amended time and time again in accordance with the requirements at a particular moment in time. The mechanisms are improved, and new minimum sizes and fishing methods to protect species are established, as is deemed necessary by the fisherman on the spot. In the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have any objections to the amendments which the Commission is proposing, right down to the last detail. They represent the latest technical and scientific developments. I think the Commission likes to hear this, and it is also therefore appropriate to emphasise the work done by the experts dealing with this in the Commission. Ultimately, Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat. On the contrary, I would like to use this report to show that things can also be done differently. The Committee on Fisheries is particularly benefiting from positive cooperation with the Commission and its services. This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations. Who, apart from the Commission, should monitor them and protect this natural resource? It is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes, which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible. Does it sound healthy to you, for instance, when I say that it is possible to breed super salmon which grow eight times faster than before? Quantity instead of quality? The awareness that we need to do something to preserve a healthy variety of food and the willingness to take appropriate action are the needs of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go onto a fishing ground like the Huns, destroy it, and then simply move with the caravan onto the next one without taking responsibility for what is left behind. If the matter is worth something to us, economically as well as ecologically, we must also take appropriate action on our own doorstep and not just in the North-West Atlantic. These measures are a step in the right direction. I do not think that tourists, on boat trips in the future, will be able to watch sand eels as well as seals being reared, but maybe, in a few years’ time, we will once again be able to say, with a clear conscience, that we can fish for this species because its preservation is guaranteed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we are now discussing the fifth amendment in two years to the regulation on technical measures for the conservation of juveniles of marine organisms. This is a report of a technical nature which is of no interest whatsoever to the majority of MEPs. However, perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Commissioner, I shall refer specifically to the carpetshell, which is mentioned in paragraph 4. I shall refer to carpetshells as I am delighted that the Commission has reduced the minimum size for selling carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres. Ladies and gentleman, this is a matter of 2 millimetres of carpetshell. These millimetres are important because when the landing size was increased to the current 40 millimetres, this caused serious problems for women who harvest shellfish in my region, Galicia, as it did for the whole marketing sector and for consumers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In Galicia, shellfish gathering on foot – and this is how carpetshells are collected – is only done by women. It would take a long and complicated explanation to say why. The fact is that men gather shellfish at sea and using technology, albeit basic, and women gather shellfish on foot using a hoe. Approximately 10 000 women in Galicia extract carpetshells, as shellfish are not fished but rather extracted. These women work in a self-sacrificing way, working long days digging up hectares and hectares of beach in very difficult conditions for very low incomes. These women then see their income dwindle away as more than half their annual income is consumed by social security contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidence seems to contradict any research the Commission used to increase the minimum landing size of these molluscs as, from 30-32 millimetres upwards, the carpetshell is mature and can reproduce. Environmental conditions in densely populated areas where the carpetshell breeds and reproduces, such as in the estuaries of Galicia, do not allow them to reach the 40 millimetres required by the regulation which we are going to change today. The truth is that 80% of naturally produced carpetshells fall short of the current size requirement. If shellfish gatherers were to wait for carpetshells to reach this size, mortality would be considerable and such loss would be due to environmental conditions and not to the women’s actions. In places where molluscs are most abundant – and I am thinking of the Ferrol and Arosa estuaries – the size of carpetshells does not exceed 36 or 38 millimetres. Carpetshells measuring 40 millimetres are neither produced, sold nor consumed, simply because there are none.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to avoid encouraging non-compliance, one of the tasks of this or any other Parliament is to ensure that the rules reflect real conditions. In the case of harvesting shellfish on foot, such non-compliance leads to illegal fishing and to a black market subject to no health checks.</p>
<p class="contents">This House must realise that, by drawing up these technical measures, we are trying to protect juveniles, by allowing them to reach a certain size and breeding age, whilst at the same time trying to reduce unnecessary yields. But for a regulation to fulfil its purpose, it must be adapted to real conditions. As a result, not only will we benefit hard-working Galician shellfish gatherers but we will also benefit consumers as they will have access to a product that has passed all health checks. We will also encourage traders who will cease to feel persecuted by legislation that, if it were fully complied with, would lead to a shortage on the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists – which I represent – supports the proposed amendment to this regulation, in the same way as it supports the amendment from the Committee on Fisheries on the size of deepwater rose shrimp. The only thing we hope, Commissioner, is that we do not have to review the regulation again within a year, because this would mean that both we and the European Commission had once again made a mistake in our calculations. But, if need be, we will be here to amend it once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Technical measures in order, especially, to protect juvenile fish– and thus secure the quantities which can be fished in the future – may be necessary. Up until now, measures have consisted of reductions in quotas, minimum mesh sizes for nets and fishing bans in certain periods. It stands to reason that such measures and arrangements should be modified in the light of new needs and knowledge. What is new is that the fisheries in which sand eel are caught off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland are to become protected areas. The reason for this is the low breeding rate of the kittiwake in recent years. Denmark is the Member State which will be most affected by this limitation, which will reduce many fishermen’s potential catches and, in that way, affect their livelihood. As a matter of form, I would point out that Denmark has agreed to this technical measure for a limited period. I should like to ask the Commission if the fishermen have been compensated for their losses or been directed to other likely fishing grounds. Because bird colonies are affected by many factors in addition to fishing, I wish to propose that the Committee on Fisheries be included in future discussions about closures or limitations on quotas against the background of what is happening on land. What I want is for us to have the opportunity to look in depth at the different factors of relevance to bird colonies and, in that connection, to discuss the bird colonies’ influence on catch sizes in relation to the principle set out under the common fisheries policy whereby the fishing industry is to be safeguarded through the optimum exploitation of marine resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on today's fisheries reports, both of which I am sure will receive the overwhelming acceptance of this House and both of which are extremely important in terms of protection and conservation of fishery resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission's updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles. We all know that sustainable development is a learning process and we must be able to update and adapt existing legislation to protect our fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have paid particular attention to scientific advice which indicates the requirement for the closure of fisheries for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland. This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves, but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities. The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern. I am also happy to note, as Mr Busk confirmed, that Denmark as a Member State principally concerned with sand eel fishery has accepted these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources, I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas: for example, in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen. I would like to ask the Commission if they have really looked at whether cutting fleet sizes actually improves the conservation of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote from the Commission's own document which says: "The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had, in general, deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4." Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced. I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this. In those states which have, on paper at least, been complying with MAGPs such as Spain and Portugal, what has happened to the vessels which are removed from the register? How many would be decommissioned? How many were scrapped? How many were sunk and so on? How many were simply transferred to another flag? How many vessels continue to fish either here in the Community or elsewhere under what is, in many cases, a flag of convenience?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must get conservation measures right, but I am not convinced that MAGPs are the way to do that. They can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea. How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says, and I quote again: "It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity."</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets. In Scotland, the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas. The new proposals to cut fleets will, ironically, fall mainly on the Scottish pelagic fleet where MAGP targets have actually been met through control measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome today's reports on this agenda, but I hope the Commission will think again when it comes to the interrelation between fleet sizes and other conservation measures. We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved, thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I think that the Commission’s proposal is not unreasonable, we have to bear in mind that the size limit is being set for the first time and that this species is an important part of the catches of certain fleets in southern Spain and Portugal where, until now, they have been fishing for shrimps without any size restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In a species that does not grow very large, 2 millimetres is a great deal when trying to determine whether the profitability of some very small-scale fisheries will be increased or decreased. As I said, such fisheries are not used to fishing with minimum size restrictions. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Portugal, the other Member State involved, wanted this minimum size to be even smaller. As a result, I feel that the compromise reached is acceptable and to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this House as well as from the Council, which were along the same lines. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also especially interested in the Commission’s proposal on the temporary halt on sand eel fishing in Scottish and English waters. I must also welcome the fact that Denmark, the country most dependent on fisheries, has not raised any major objections to this measure. Their attitude should enable us to progress towards a more realistic management system of fishery resources used for industrial purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often expressed my doubts about the idea that we should maintain large fleets in depleted ecosystems, such as those of the Community, which means that fish stocks are being destroyed in order to produce fish meal or oil.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament Resolution of June 1998 on this type of fishing, which was based on a report drawn up by Mr Kindermann, it was highlighted that 60% of Community yields in the North Sea, Skagerrat and Kattegat are intended for this type of industrial use. Reports from the FAO and environmental organisations estimate that 70% of fisheries production is used to this end and say this is contributing to the destruction of stocks on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, these figures also highlight the high socio-economic dependency of some Community regions on such activity. For this reason, while I have no desire whatsoever to eliminate this activity completely, it may be an opportune moment to debate the possibility of achieving a greater balance, taking account of the various fleets’ objectives in the use of resources. Eventually, this new balance should be borne in mind when distributing Community funds for structural measures as well as administrative and market policy measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report, whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following, the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries; secondly, the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans; and thirdly, with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland. It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries: taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels. In 1998, a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds, specifically the kittiwake, which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years, were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet, primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative. It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food.</p>
<p class="contents">The ICES subsequently looked at the science again and suggested a closed area stretching from mid-Northumberland northwards to include the Grampian coast. This closed area is the one proposed by the Commission in December as part of the annual TAC Regulation and adopted by the Council. These measures have, I understand, already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved. I therefore hope the Council will be able, after this debate, to reach a speedy agreement. It is important for the conservation of sea birds. It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us. We can improve our resources. We are not self-sufficient in fish in the Union, only 50% self-sufficient. With good conservation and better practices, we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing. We could increase by something like EUR 4 000 million the value of the fish landed in the European Union if we could apply a little bit more care over a period of time to our fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is highly technical. It is important that we do the research, keep up the revision and gradually convince people that the European Commission is not a hostile organisation sent from afar to persecute fishermen and prevent them from making a living.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved, because of the reduction in stocks, because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons. There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working. Surely, a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available. The same applies to trains or trucks. So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if, in fact, the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas? If the quotas are being observed, surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels. Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that. Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there.</p>
<p class="contents">There were banner headlines just because the Commission published, a few days ago, a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced. Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed. There is no need for it. Let us sit down, come to the Fisheries Committee, listen to the officials, listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have one programme broadcast in Ireland that deals with the sea. It is called "Seascapes". The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum, they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting, which goes on continuously, in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests. Let us, as responsible public representatives, try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed this subject in great depth. It has not been too controversial, so it is also possible to discuss it at the end of such a sitting. Since I am often here on Fridays anyway, I personally do not find this at all difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject is exemption regulations, which are in force for the European insurance industry. You all know that competition law has been one of the most important objectives of the European Union – and therefore of the European Commission – since the founding Treaties came into existence. The general aim of competition law is to ensure that there is competition in the European Internal Market. This serves consumers, promotes technical progress, and prevents monopolies and agreements. Therefore, the rules on this are strict. The Commission can and must take action in accordance with the rules, which have three different spheres of application: agreements or cartel agreements which are generally prohibited, abuse of a dominant market position, and public subsidies. Over the past few years, the Commission, on all these issues, has repeatedly shown that it takes the provisions of the Treaties very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We will deal with the first of these areas today. The general prohibition of cartel agreements is lifted under certain conditions; these are the exemption regulations. Price fixing, restrictions on, or control of, production, dividing up markets, application of different prerequisites for the same services and the extra provisions of the Treaties, which often vary tremendously in Europe and exclude different services, are incompatible with the laws, even in the areas where exemption regulations apply. Under Article 81(3), exemption regulations only apply – please listen carefully – when consumers receive an appropriate share of the benefit generated and no unnecessary restrictions ruling out competition are imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">A regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since 1992, and expires in 2003. The Commission is required to submit a situation report every six years. The present report is available. The Block Exemption Regulation for the insurance industry lays down and permits common rules governing agreement on the calculation of premiums, the stipulation of policy conditions, joint coverage of certain types of risk, and safety precautions. To date, agreements on claims settlement and registers of aggravated risks have not been included. I hope that when the Rothley report on the harmonisation of civil liability insurance in respect of the use of motor vehicles is adopted after the third reading on Monday, the Commission can, and will, also incorporate – on account of the harmonised legal basis – the settlement of claims into this future exemption regulation. It will then be much easier for European Union citizens, in future, to be able to settle claims abroad, including in EU Member States, with their own insurers, safe in the knowledge that these agreements are also then guaranteed by the Commission within the framework of the exemption regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has made unanimous demands on the Commission in its proposal. These should be taken into consideration by the Commission when examining the proposal. This concerns, firstly, the definition of market share in a globalised market, followed by detailed questions about the lead insurer, for whom this might not apply. When there is one large and 20 small insurers, then the large one may not have more than 10 per cent of the market share for the exemption agreement to be accepted. Whether this is correct or not is doubtful. This concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination. We want the notice period for an insurance company to be 6 months and not 12, and we want to bring about a harmonised basis for European standards in the settlement of claims.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I can say that Parliament is satisfied with this interim report and that it expects the Commission to make continuous progress on this matter and achieve an end result for the insurance industry within the framework of the exemption regulations in force, all of which expire in 2002 and 2003, including for other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would urge you to give your assent. Thank you very much.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am glad to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in substantial agreement with Mr Langen and finds no legal obstacles to this bloc exemption regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the House will know, the bloc exemption creates exemptions from normal competition law, of the kind Mr Langen mentioned, in relation to the calculation of premiums where net premiums may be jointly calculated by insurers. Secondly, in the establishment of standard policy conditions for direct insurance and common models illustrating profits from insurance policies involving an element of capitalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It also creates an exemption to make possible co-insurance, common coverage of certain risks and, finally, the coordination of technical specifications for safety equipment and procedures. The Commission says in its report that it is disappointed that the insurance industry has not taken up as much of that as it might have done.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all areas where it seems clear that there is a genuine public interest in not insisting on the strictest rigours of competition law. What that draws to our attention, in a philosophical way, is that even in a competitive market, insurance is inherently a collective activity in which people share risks among themselves. If I might make a remark about a currently controversial topic in my own country, I think it is a pity to see such vigorous efforts being made to de-mutualise excellent old mutual assurance companies which fully express the collective aspect of insurance, and I am sad to think of a raid being made on the Standard Life in this way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The more the state withdraws, the stronger and more profitable the insurance sector becomes. Everyone needs insurance these days. At the same time, consumers have a deep distrust of the insurance sector. Everyone fears having to pay premiums that are too high and that the small print in insurance policies means that when problems arise, one has far less right to a pay-out than one had anticipated on taking out the insurance.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The premiums are deemed to be too high and the payouts too low. The ongoing international take-over battle between major insurance companies and banks shows just how sizeable the profits in this sector have now become. In the meantime, this report has made it clear how bureaucratic and complex the regulations are that the European Union must put in place if it is to bring a degree of regulation to the insurance sector. Arrangements must now be put in place whereby insurance companies are authorised, via exemption decisions, to join forces in order to share major risks or to re-insure, without breaking the anti-merger rules. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear from the report that there have been all manner of complaints about lack of clarity, deadlines, and the question as to whether the current rules turn out to be to the advantage of the insured or the insurer. It would appear that there is in fact no question whatsoever of having the highly commended free competition, but a bureaucratically regulated competition instead.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This begs the question as to whether consumers would benefit far more from democratically controlled, regional institutions than from bureaucratic competition. In the case of the former, everyone would know what factors are taken into account, how premiums are calculated, and that any profits would be put to good use, whereas there would be a complete lack of transparency in the case of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"> I am therefore calling for a radical overhaul of the insurance sector, so as to make it transparent and subject to democratic control. Unfortunately, until such time as these improvements have been made, we will have to muddle through with the instruments currently in force. This is better than doing nothing at all. We cannot afford to allow the six-year deadline that was set previously, to elapse, without having put new arrangements in place. Hence my group is proposing to vote in favour of the proposed regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes the draft resolution, not only for its overall support concerning the Commission's application of the regulation, but also for the specific comments which it contains on how the regulation can be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word of background about the regulation in question is perhaps in order. Before 1992, the competition directorate-general of the Commission was submerged by literally hundreds of notifications of agreements in the insurance field, many of which raised similar issues and were eligible for an exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty. Rather than adopting hundreds of individual exemption decisions, the Commission adopted in 1992 a block exemption regulation granting exemption, with conditions, to agreements between insurance undertakings in four categories: agreements concerning the joint calculation of risk premiums, those concerning standard policy conditions, co-insurance and reinsurance, pooling arrangements and agreements adopting standards for safety equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Regulation of 1991 enabling the Commission to adopt an insurance block exemption regulation also authorised the inclusion of two further areas which the Commission, however, decided not to include in its regulation for lack of experience in those areas, namely agreements on claims settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption of the Block Exemption Regulation in 1992, most of the notifications on the Commission's table were withdrawn, but some were not, as the notifying parties considered that the regulation did not provide total clarity as to whether their agreements were eligible for exemption. Most of these notifications concerned insurance pools.</p>
<p class="contents">The current regulation expires on 31 March 2003 and a new regulation will be necessary. The future regulation should build on these strengths and remedy any weaknesses in the existing one. The report produced by the Commission on 12 May 1999, which it was pursuant to Article 8 of the Council enabling regulation, was the first step in the process leading to the adoption of a new regulation. It summarises in detail the experience of the Commission in applying the regulation and the various problems it has identified. It does not, however, contain precise proposals for the future regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">These will only be decided upon after the end of the consultation process. Considerable account will be taken of Parliament's resolution in this process. Other interested parties, including professional insurance bodies and consumer organisations, will also be consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step in the consultation will be a hearing organised by the Commission on 28 June of this year for an exchange of views between all those who have submitted comments on the report on the regulation. This hearing responds in part to the call in the draft resolution for an informative debate on the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the area in which most improvement to the regulation is needed is that of pools. Significant change will be necessary here, but key questions exist in all the other areas. The comments and suggestions contained in the draft resolution, for which I thank Parliament, are all relevant and interesting in this context, although each of them will have to be analysed individually and on its merits.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just respond at this stage to two issues of a similar nature raised by both Mr Langen and Mr Meijer, and that is the question whether the Commission accepts the draft opinion's recommendation that agreements on claims settlement should be included in the future block exemption regulation. The Commission has an open mind at this stage as to whether agreements on claim settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risks should be covered by the future regulation. It takes good note of the fact that the draft opinion recommends the inclusion of agreements and on claims settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of the draft resolution that the regulation has been successful overall, but that a moderate enhancement is needed, is one that the Commission entirely shares. The draft resolution is a most helpful contribution to this end and the Commission will keep Parliament fully informed and consulted on the process of revising the regulation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the public and ourselves are obviously pleased with the simplifications he has explained so clearly. I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well. You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels. And these centralists are also, of course, setting their sights on Luxembourg – as a by-product so to speak – for Parliament’s Secretariat.</p>

One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning. Their bus was stopped by the French police under the pretext that the driver would not have a French driving licence. This particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years. What is going on here then? I must say that these visitors wonder, naturally, whether this is what Europe is all about. Moreover, the French police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet. The visitors had to pool their French francs together to pay the horrendous FRF 5 000 fine. This cannot be right, Mr President! I will, of course, check …</p>

<p class="contents">A young 20-year old, who had, sadly, suffered a serious road accident, rose to his feet and said: “I have suffered this serious road accident but I am, so to speak, content because I have received EUR 500 000 from the insurance company”. Another person present at the meeting, who was about 40 years of age, said: “I suffered exactly the same road accident, but I only received EUR 200 000. “An older man who was about 60 added: “I only received EUR 20 000”. Another man who was about 70 years old said: “I suffered the same accident with the same results, and I was given EUR 1 000”. An elderly 80-year old pensioner, who could not even get out of his chair because he was so disabled, said: “I did not receive anything at all from the insurance”. There you have it. Insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless. But I say that the elderly are worth more. I therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice.</p><p class="contents" style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:center">⁂</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>At the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 5 October 1998, the Council expressed its indignation and condemned those responsible for the massacre at Racak in the strongest possible terms. Furthermore, with a view to making a substantial contribution to the investigations of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), on 22 December 1998 the Council approved, under Article J.3 of the Treaty on European Union, a Joint Action with the aim of dispatching an EU Forensic Expert Team as quickly as possible, with uninhibited access to the locations to be inspected, in order to investigate this case and inform the Council of its conclusions. Article 1 of the Annex to the Joint Action, which came into force on 1 January 1999, set out the mandate of the EU forensic experts, but did not stipulate a date for its expiry nor did it include any renewal or review clause. The Expert Team’s report on the incident at Racak was presented to the Council on 17 March 1999.</p>
<p>All the Member States of the European Union have decided to fully cooperate with the ICTY and to fulfil their obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. As the President of the ICTY noted on 31 May 1999, these obligations include the obligation on all states and organisations holding information on alleged crimes coming under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to communicate that information to the Office of the Prosecutor.</p>
<p>The Council, to which the Expert Team duly presented its report, has respected these obligations, as in the first half of 1999, during the German Presidency, it communicated the results of the autopsies on the victims of the massacre at Racak to the ICTY. In June 2000, the Expert Team intends to present to the Council its final report covering all its activities and conclusions under the 1999-2000 Joint Action.</p>
<p>Carla dal Ponte, the ICTY Prosecutor, stated on 29 September 1999 after her appointment that the ICTY would continue to investigate crimes committed during the armed conflict in Kosovo and would bring those responsible to trial at the Court of First Instance in The Hague.</p>

<p>In view of the increasingly authoritarian and nationalist stance being taken by the Beijing regime and the threat this poses to the stability of the entire continent of Asia – a threat which many Western economic operators have already discerned, as is demonstrated by various economic indicators and, in particular, the decline in investment ­ is the Council aware of the vital and urgent need to shift the focus of the Union’s policy on Asia from Beijing to Delhi? If so, is the Council aware of the need to make the Indian authorities aware, in an explicit and concrete manner, of its willingness to do this? Furthermore, is the Council aware of the adverse, and indeed dissuasive, effect that the introduction of an increasing number of political, social and environmental criteria into economic and commercial negotiations, including the WTO negotiations, is having on the development of Euro-Indian relations? Does the Council not consider that these political, social and environmental issues, the importance of which is not disputed here, should be dealt with by separate and pragmatic discussions and should, in no case, be used by one or other of the parties as a means of halting the development of a strategic relationship between India and the European Union?

<p>The Council does not share the honourable Member’s view that the focus of the Union’s policy on Asia is exclusively on China, and does not therefore see any urgent need for a significant change of policy. The Council will continue to pursue the Union’s broad objective of maintaining and promoting balanced relations with all the main Asian countries, such as Japan, China, India and Korea and the ASEAN countries, such as Indonesia.</p>
<p>Against this general background, the Union’s decision to arrange the first ever EU-India Summit in Lisbon on 28 June is a clear indication of the EU’s political will to strengthen the existing relations between both parties, based on the results of the long and fruitful cooperation between Europe and India, and to translate them into a new strategic dimension for the twenty-first century. On the basis of the universal values of democracy and respect for human rights, for the rule of law and for fundamental freedoms which the Union shares with India, the Union intends, at this first summit, to strengthen the existing cooperation and dialogue, to promote economic growth and bilateral trade on the basis of a precise multilateral standards-based system, to enhance contacts between their respective peoples, and to step up cultural, educational and scientific exchanges. The Union will also endeavour to secure India’s commitment to cooperation on peace matters and in resolving regional conflicts by means of dialogue and through confidence-building measures, and efforts on India’s part to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Lastly, the Union will endeavour to strengthen cooperation with India in areas of common interest such as defending and promoting human rights, protecting the environment, and combating terrorism and drugs.</p>
<p>With regard to relations between the EU and India in the WTO framework, India has indicated that it is willing to enter into a new round of negotiations, despite the existence of non-trade matters to be dealt with outside the negotiations, such as the protection of workers’ fundamental rights and environmental protection, and also investment and competition. Furthermore, the EU wishes a global trade round covering a wide range of subjects, including non-trade issues, to commence as soon as possible. </p>
<p>These different approaches adopted by the EU and India towards future WTO developments will not, as the honourable Member suggests, have an adverse affect on relations between the two parties. On the contrary, the long and fruitful cooperation between Europe and India to which I have referred ensures that we will maintain a constructive dialogue which will enable us to explain our respective positions much more clearly and will, I hope, lead to a convergence in our points of view.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0416"></a>

<p>With reference to its oral answer in March (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0252_EN.html">H-0252/00</a>), the Council wishes to stress that the military operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were approved by NATO, not by the EU. Any question on that decision should be addressed to the EU Member States who are also members of NATO. The Council deeply deplores the human rights violations in Chechnya and has adopted a series of measures to improve the human rights situation and to ensure that those responsible for such crimes are brought to trial.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly urged Russia to stop the human rights violations in Chechnya and has called for an independent national inquiry on human rights so as to ensure that its findings are impartial. It accordingly approved a resolution at the April session of the UN Human Rights Commission. Furthermore, it has successfully exerted pressure for a presence by the international organisations in Chechnya.</p>
<p>In fact, in response to increasing international pressure, Russia has taken several steps in the right direction: it has created a National Public Commission on Human rights and it has permitted the publication of a report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It has accepted the return of the OSCE Support Group, and has agreed to give NGOs and the ICRC access to Chechnya. In addition, it has agreed that two experts from the Council of Europe should be present in Mr Kalamanov’s office. Lastly, the President-in-Office of the OSCE and the troika of EU Heads of Mission in Moscow have visited the region.</p>
<p>The Council will closely follow developments following these measures and will take every opportunity at its disposal to convey to the Russians its concern about the human rights situation in Chechnya, the next such opportunity being the EU-Russian Summit on 29 May.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The situation in Presevo in Serbia is particularly critical: separatist elements are making their presence felt and stepping up their activities in an alarming manner, and incidents involving the illegal movement and transit of weapons to regions with a strong Albanian-speaking presence are on the increase. This situation is exacerbating existing fears, and there are signs that the flashpoint is spreading beyond Kosovo to other regions of Serbia, which will have unforeseeable consequences for the stability of the region as a whole.</p>
<p>How does the Council view this situation one year after the adoption of UN Resolution 1244? Does it not consider that this tension is being exacerbated by the declared objective of the EU – which is contrary to international law – to overturn the legally elected government of Serbia and to violate the basic right of a people to decide which government it wants? Does it not also agree that the central objective of the EU policy in the Balkans must be to preserve the status quo of borders and consequently to preserve the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its federal states?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council agrees that it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to bring an end to the continuing tensions in Kosovo and to the fresh outbreak of ethnic violence there. It also shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the risk of tension spreading beyond Kosovo, and in particular to the Presevo Valley. Accordingly, both the Presidency and the Secretary-General/High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Javier Solana, have repeatedly pressed Kosovo’s Albanian leaders to refrain from taking any action which could cause violence to escalate in the Presevo region. The EU also fully supports KFOR’s efforts to control the administrative border between Kosovo and the border regions of southern Serbia.</p>
<p>The Council is firmly convinced that a satisfactory solution for Kosovo is key to the stability of the whole region. Against this background, the European Union’s objective continues to be to create a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the internationally recognised borders of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. To this end, the EU entirely supports the efforts being made by the international community to secure the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1244, as it supports the efforts being made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent the escalation of violence, to facilitate the safe return of all those who have fled their homes and to create a viable administration in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly called on Kosovo’s political leaders to adopt urgent measures with a view to avoiding further incidents and disturbances, to condemn violence and extremism, to expel extremists from within their ranks and to support UNMIK and KFOR. The Council has warned that its assistance in Kosovo also depends on the progress made with inter-ethnic reconciliation and the implementation of all aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.</p>
<p>The Council is committed to the process of democratisation and coexistence. Only by the representatives of minorities sharing responsibilities will it be possible to help to construct a multi-ethnic Kosovo. The Council accordingly welcomes the decision made by certain Serbian leaders in Kosovo to take part in the Joint Interim Administrative Structure. The Council also considers it of the utmost importance that UNMIK and the OSCE should make careful preparations for the municipal elections due to be held this year, including arrangements for postal votes and the participation of minorities. In this respect, it is vital that all ethnic groups take part in the municipal elections if they are to be representative.</p>
<p>With a view to supporting this democratisation and coexistence process, the EU is cooperating with other members of the international community to rebuild the daily lives of Kosovo’s entire population, regardless of their ethnic origin. Apart from the significant bilateral aid granted by the Member States in 1999/2000, the European Community has made humanitarian aid to the value of EUR 429 million available to refugees from Kosovo, to persons displaced within the region and to returnees. Reconstruction and exceptional financial assistance, including support for UNMIK, will total EUR 437 million between 1999 and 2000. Finally, the Council notes that the creation of the “fourth pillar” of UNMIK – economic reconstruction – is being carried out under the aegis of the European Union, and has already indicated the importance of this pillar for the future of peace in Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0423"></a>

<p>The draft resolution on the human rights situation in China, tabled by the US delegation at the 56th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, was not put to the vote, following the adoption, on 18 April 2000, of a ‘non-intervention motion’ based on the draft resolution tabled by the Chinese delegation.</p>
<p>The Council regrets the fact that a non-intervention motion of this kind was, once again, tabled and adopted. In line with the position which the EU has repeatedly adopted in the Commission on Human Rights, the Council, as a matter of principle, favours voting against any non-intervention motion which is visibly intended to prevent that body from dealing with situations existing in particular countries. No country, large or small, should be permitted to exploit procedural instruments in order to avoid being criticised or judged by the international community.</p>
<p>On 20 March 2000, the Council decided that in the event of the resolution being put to the vote the EU Member States which are members of the Commission on Human Rights (D, F, E, I, LUX, P, UK) would vote in favour. This position reflects the deep concern at the human rights situation in China which is shared by the European Parliament, civil society and NGOs.</p>
<p>A degree of progress has been made in improving the legal system and bolstering social and economic rights; nonetheless, scant progress is evident at ground level, especially concerning civil society and political rights. The Council is deeply disturbed at the constant and pervasive constraints on fundamental freedoms, above all on the freedom to hold meetings and the freedoms of expression and association. It has also observed, with deep concern, the frequency with which the death penalty is applied in China, as well as the continued existence of administrative detention camps in which people can be held without proper legal assistance and, in most cases, without a fair trial.</p>
<p>As the Union has stressed in the Commission on Human Rights, the Council places great importance on the human rights dialogue between the EU and China, and is monitoring and evaluating this dialogue on an ongoing basis. The Council, however, also wishes to stress that it is essential that the willingness of the Chinese authorities to discuss human rights matters of mutual interest should be translated into concrete actions with a view to ensuring that the human rights of all persons under Chinese jurisdiction are respected in practice and in full.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0431"></a>

<p>Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia have undertaken commitments for early closure of their non-upgradeable nuclear reactors. These reactors will thus be definitively shutdown in accordance with agreed timetables. The decommissioning and dismantling of the reactors will indeed take a longer period, irrespective of the closure dates. It is the responsibility of the respective Candidate Countries to draw up decommissioning programmes. In addition, the Nuclear Power Plant operators need to submit detailed decommissioning plans for approval and licensing by the nuclear safety regulatory authorities of the particular countries. In all countries, this is both a legal requirement for the licensing of the decommissioning as well as a political demand under the energy strategies, to allow the Governments to devise programmes to address social and economic consequences of the closure and decommissioning of the Nuclear Power Plants. The Commission has been active in the preparation of this planning process, however. Decommissioning studies have been concluded under various PHARE programmes and allow the candidate countries to choose the most appropriate option of technical decommissioning methods. The Commission is also committed to provide PHARE support for the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, and for consequential measures to be taken in the conventional energy sector. Decommissioning projects will be supported from these programmes, via the Ignalina, Kozloduy and Bohunice International Decommissioning Support Funds to be managed by the EBRD. In the Ignalina case, projects have been identified by the Lithuanian authorities, and predominantly include the construction of waste and spent fuel storage facilities. The same is happening in Bulgaria and Slovakia. The Commission is concentrating its efforts on the provision of support to the most effective investment and management steps needed within the current financial perspective ending in 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is undertaking a number of steps. The compliance of Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia with their closure commitments regarding the Ignalina, Bohunice V1 and Kozloduy 1-4 reactors will be scrutinised as part of the Commission’s Regular Reports. The respective candidate countries have also committed themselves to work closely with the Commission in regularly providing information on the nuclear energy sector. The compliance will also figure strongly in the Commission’s recommendations with regard to the opening and closing of the negotiation chapter on energy. Furthermore, the financial assistance provided under the special national PHARE programmes for the three above-mentioned countries is conditional upon the countries’ compliance. This will be taken into due regard when programming this support under the annual budgeting requirements. In addition, the manager of the forthcoming International Decommissioning Support Funds will report on the recipient countries’ compliance with their closure commitments and the conditionalities set out in the grant agreements with the Funds. Likewise, the disbursement of the Euratom loan offered to Bulgaria for the upgrading of Units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy plant will be conditional upon its compliance to its closure commitments for units 1-4.</p>
<p>The provision of a Euratom loan is not the trigger to prepare decommissioning projects for Kozloduy 1 and 2. The Euratom loan is designed to improve the upgradeable reactor units 5 and 6 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, which are of a different type and design. However, as already mentioned, its disbursement will be conditional on Bulgaria’s compliance with its closure commitments for the units 1-4. The Bulgarian authorities are obliged to draw up decommissioning programmes and plans as a consequence of the Understanding agreed with the Commission on 29 November 1999. The Commission is working together with the Bulgarian authorities for the implementation of the said Understanding. Cooperation also covers the drawing of a detailed plan and timetable for the definitive closure and decommissioning of units 1 and 2. A meeting of the Joint Working Group was held in February and a new meeting is planned for June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0360"></a>

<p>The Commission initiated the Article 88(2)(ex Article 93) procedure against the Swedish reduced social contributions scheme, because it has doubts as to its compatibility with Community state aid rules.</p>
<p>The aid granted under the scheme falls within the scope of Article 87(1) (ex article 92) of the Treaty. The reduction of the social contributions constitutes an operating aid favouring certain companies in North Sweden. Moreover, the scheme covers a number of sectors, such as hotels and call-centres, in which there is significant intra-Community trade. The granting of operating aid to companies in such sectors could very well distort competition in the common market.</p>
<p>Under present State aid rules, operating aid in North Sweden can be approved only as compensation for the extra cost of transport of goods in low population density areas. However, the Swedish scheme applies exclusively to service companies that do not transport goods, and that therefore do not have “additional transport costs”. Sweden argued that the scheme provides compensation for additional “distance-related costs” other than additional transport costs of goods. It is clear that the concept of “distance-related costs”, as defined by Sweden, constitutes a significant widening of the concept of “the cost of the transport of goods”, as defined under the Community’s State aid rules.</p>
<p>The opening of a formal investigation under Article 88(2) EC gives the Swedish authorities an opportunity to present their arguments in favour of the scheme. It also enables other interested parties to comment on the scheme. This will allow the Commission to take a more fully informed decision on whether it is necessary to widen the concept of “transport costs” as proposed by Sweden.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0386"></a>

<p>However, according to the Treaty, the State support, in whatever form received by a credit institution for the specific task of raising funds for the Member State, has to be limited in its effects to the performance of that task and may not spill over in any way into competitive activities of the institution.</p>
<p>In applying competition rules, the Commission’s final concern is the consumer’s interest.

<p>The transaction as originally notified to the Commission involved the acquisition of control by Nabisco over United Biscuits (UB) and Horizon Biscuits, with the involvement of a number of financial companies as minority shareholders. It would have led to high combined market shares in several countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom mainly). In the United Kingdom, the largest market, the combination of UB and Horizon would have created competition concerns because it would have resulted in significant market shares in both branded and own label biscuits produced by the parties. The British competition authorities were of the same view and requested that the case be referred to them under Article 9 of the Merger Regulation in so far as it concerned the biscuit market in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the parties proposed and put into effect modifications to the operation as a result of which Horizon was excluded from the deal. Horizon’s owner, the American investment company Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst (“HMTF”), has also sold its minority shareholding to the other investment companies involved in the operation. As a result of these modifications, the overlap of market shares in the UK was eliminated and the competition problems resolved. The operation could therefore be approved. In these circumstances, a referral of the case to the United Kingdom was no longer necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0351"></a>

<p>In response to a complaint, the Commission instigated infringement proceedings against Greece and reached the decision that the tax legislation affecting the purchase of property was discriminatory in that the exemption was restricted to only Greek nationals. When the relevant provisions were not amended, the Commission decided to refer the discriminatory provision to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The Commission only prosecutes in cases of infringements which are not corrected. If Greece is prepared to amend its legislation to comply with the requirements of Community law, then the Commission is willing to assist, should Greece so request. It is not, however, acceptable to retain an exemption for currency payments for only a small category of Greek citizens (i.e. sailors that have been away from Greece for at least six years). The original motivation behind the relevant provision (which dates from 1950), apparently also of a monetary nature, is no longer remotely valid in a system of the free movement of capital. Such a concept is, moreover, not easy to reconcile with the prospect of Greece’s entry into the EMU. Finally, in the view of the Commission, the social reasons given to justify the exemption for sailors are far from clear and seem instead to create inequality between Greek citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0353"></a>

<p>The objective of Community policy has always been the reduction of pain inflicted on animals during tests, and wherever and as soon as possible, the elimination of animal suffering, an aim which is also included in Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>. Therefore, this proposal serves this purpose as it aims to ban testing on animals for cosmetic finished products and ingredients. Furthermore, it will fulfil the wishes of a large number of people – shown in opinion polls – as it aims to ban definitively animal tests for cosmetics throughout the Community. On the contrary, a marketing ban would not answer this purpose, animal testing still being performed in the Community for cosmetic products to be exported.</p>
<p>The development of alternative methods being the key solution to suppress animal testing, the Commission will take the lead in the regulatory acceptance of in vitro methods validated at Community level by the Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD). Furthermore it will endeavour to ensure the mutual recognition of data from in vitro and in vivo studies through negotiations with third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Union-Jordan Association Agreement was signed in November 1997 and endorsed by the European Parliament in June 1998. The Union-Jordan Association Agreement is the 5th Agreement that has been concluded within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership established by the Barcelona Declaration after similar agreements with Tunisia, Morocco, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Jordan ratified the Agreement in September 1999 and seven Member states ratified until now. For Italy internal ratification seems to be complete, but ratification was not yet notified to the Council. When it is notified, a majority of Member states will have ratified.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the ratification process of Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements in Member States can take between somewhat less than three years (Tunisia) and up to five years (Israel). Against this background the state of ratification of the Union-Jordan Agreement is rather positive. For that reason the Commission remains confident that the Agreement can enter into force by the end of 2000 or beginning of 2001.</p>
<p>The Commission will address the time lapse between completion of negotiations of Euro-Med Agreements and their full ratification in more general terms during the Lisbon Euro-Mediterranean Meeting of Foreign Ministers in May 2000.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of problems relating to the exploitation of mackerel and herring stocks such as misreporting by species and by catch areas. Furthermore there are also indications that shoals or grade sizes of fish of low commercial value are dumped at sea in order to maximise the value of catch quota with more valuable fish (so called “slipping” and “high grading”). There is, however, insufficient information on the scope of these problems. Therefore, transparency needs to be improved.</p>
<p>As regards misreporting by area and by species, measures have been strengthened and may be further strengthened. Indeed, vessels over 24 metres overall length are subject to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), which allows the authorities to monitor continuously their areas of operation. Furthermore stricter controls of landings are carried out. Slipping and high grading practices hamper the conservation of stocks. The Commission has programmed a detailed examination of these issues with experts from the Member States concerned. The placing of observers on board fishing vessels is certainly one of the options which will be considered. The Commission has already invited the Member States concerned to place scientific observers on board of some vessels in order to collect information on these problems. At this stage, the Commission is not yet in a position to say if and when observers will be placed on the vessels in question.</p>
<p>Concerning current negotiations taking place on quota allocation of blue whiting, in particular, between the coastal states in the North-East Atlantic Ocean but also in the framework of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), the Commission will adopt a realistic and firm position in the defence of the interest of the Community as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0369"></a>

<p>In response to the first part of the question asked by the honourable Member, universities have provided several of the many constructive contributions that have been received. It is interesting to note that the contributions have come from various quarters – some from researchers in a personal capacity, others made on behalf of a research department, and others still from a university as a whole. In addition, the Commission has sent out more than 2 000 copies of the communication to organisations representing the sectors concerned across Europe, including universities and research institutes. A meeting which some 80 figures from the academic world, industry and the European Institutions had been invited to attend took place on 3 May 2000. The Commission saw this meeting as an opportunity to hold more detailed discussions on the issues addressed in the communication with the groups concerned. </p>
<p>In response to the second part of the question, the Commission has asked for the views of 600 European companies on the issues in the communication which are of vital importance to industry. The list of enterprises which have received the questionnaire includes in particular those which took part in the framework programme, amongst them a number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The SME sector was also represented at the meeting of 3 May. Furthermore, several of the proposed themes for action for the creation of a European research area directly affect industry and more especially the SMEs. In particular, theme for action 3.3 involves proposals for measures to encourage the creation of companies and risk-capital investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Does the Commission believe that the EU has been better able to cope with the effects of the recent sharp rises in oil prices than in the past and, having due regard to environmental considerations, does it favour providing incentives to the Member States to encourage and promote offshore wind and wave electricity generation projects as an additional clean and lasting solution?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The short term impact of the sharp rises in oil prices was undoubtedly significantly less than in the past. On the basis of an increase in the average oil price for the year from USD 17 (1999) to USD 21.5 (2000) the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is estimated to increase only slightly from 1.2% (1999) to 1.5% (2000) and 1.6% (2001).</p>
<p>This currently observed enhanced ability to cope with price increases is due to a variety of reasons. The dependence of our economies on oil has decreased – oil consumption per unit of GDP has fallen from 0.15 tonnes oil equivalent (toe) in 1973 to 0.078 toe in 1998, wages and salaries are relatively stable in the Community, and consumer prices are cushioned from sharp increases in import prices by the reforms and deregulation boosting competition and the relatively high tax component, and hence low crude price component in most oil products.</p>
<p>The Commission in its White Paper on renewable sources of energy set out a strategy to double the share of renewable energies in gross domestic energy consumption in the Community by 2010 (from the present 6% to 12%) including a timetable of actions to achieve this objective in the form of an Action Plan. The Commission, on 10 May 2000, put forward a proposal for a directive with the strategic objective of creating a framework for a significant increase of electricity produced on the basis of renewable sources of energy and to facilitate its access to the internal market for electricity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under its ALTENER and 5<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programmes, formerly Thermie and Joule-Thermie programs, the Commission has supported many projects for further development, demonstration, and application of wind power. Wind turbines have steadily increased in size and thus the unit cost of generation has become more attractive. A key action towards the target figure of 10 000 MW of new wind generation capacity is a feature of the ‘Campaign for Take-Off’ for renewable energies, which is also included in the Action Plan, is a series of credibility actions over the initial period 1999-2003 aimed at kick-starting the effort towards the 12% target for 2010. The intended priority in this key sector action is large wind farms, including offshore, and challenging sites and applications.</p>
<p>The ALTENER programme, and the demonstration components of the Fifth Framework Programme and predecessors, address renewable energy technologies such as wind, which are state-of the-art and thus completely or largely ready for the market. This is not the case for wave power (and tidal) generation which is the subject of research projects currently supported under the Fifth Framework Programme non-nuclear energy component ‘energie’ under its various key actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0375"></a>

<p>Health and social services aimed at enabling older people to remain in their home fall under the remit of social protection systems in Member States. Home care services are thus the exclusive responsibility of Member States. Indeed, in most Member States substantial parts of this responsibility have furthermore been delegated to regional or local authorities.</p>
<p>There are no programmes at Community level which could give support to the development of home care services in Member States. Since the Council in 1995 found itself unable to agree on the Commission’s proposal for an action programme targeted on older people, no further programmes of this sort have been planned.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Contacts Points Group on older peoples policies the Commission has provided a platform for Member States for the exchange of experiences and dissemination of best practices. In the last two years systematic exchanges have focussed on differences in the organisation of long term care.</p>
<p>The development of care and other services which allow frail and dependent older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible (Care-in-place) is a policy priority in the older peoples policies of the great majority of Member States.</p>
<p>The issue of caring for very old and frail people was raised in the communication ‘Towards a Europe of all Ages’ which the Commission issued as a contribution to the United Nations (UN) International Year of Older Persons. In the communication the Commission underlines the need for a great expansion of the capacity of formal care systems in combination with better support for family carers as the ageing trend in our societies accelerates. Home help, home nursing and specially adapted housing are mentioned among the provisions which will need to be substantially expanded.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0377"></a>

<p>The Commission has no evidence that there has been a significant increase in such direct marketing activities by the financial institutions. The practice of offering special offers and direct marketing opportunities in mailings with clients is relatively commonplace in Europe. This practice is often resorted to by credit card companies who not only promote certain products or services but also negotiate discounts and rebates with the associated service or product suppliers. Thus, the customer is offered a form of loyalty discount when purchasing the promoted product or service with the relevant credit card.</p>
<p>Direct marketing with introductory or loyalty sales promotions is a less expensive form of promotion of traders’ activities than other forms of commercial communications such as media advertising. In this case the financial institutions offer to other businesses and traders the possibility of inserting advertising in the financial institution’s account statement mailings to their customers. The financial institutions can offer this service by local area or at regional/national/international level depending on the requirements of the advertisers. There is nothing to prevent small traders from benefiting from this commercial communications service to attract customers to their shops (although it must be said that many of them will not feel it practical or useful to do so).</p>
<p>On the other hand, to the extent that these commercial communication services consist of discounts or promotions it is often suggested that larger enterprises can offer more attractive discounts or sales promotions compared with small traders and this has led to national restrictions in a number of Member States to protect against unfair competition. The Commission is currently considering this general issue and the differing national regulations in this domain with its Expert Group on commercial communications. Following the opinions of the national experts involved it hopes to present a Communication on this issue later this year.</p>
<p>These activities can also encourage competition between financial intermediaries and thus provide for more efficient services to final customers. Those who carry such advertising earn revenues that can offset the costs of mailing their customers and therefore make their charges more competitive. Furthermore, in those cases where the advertiser pays for the service by offering a discount to the customers of the financial institution sending the mailing, this incites the customer to rely more extensively on that financial institution’s payment mechanism rather than that of its competitor.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0378"></a>

<p>In its communication of 17 March 2000 on ‘Priorities in EU road safety - Progress report and ranking of actions’, the Commission has not sought to set any particular store by the contribution of road infrastructures towards improving road safety at Community level.</p>
<p>In fact, in submitting the Action Programme for 1997-2001, the Commission highlighted the constraints inherent in the traditional division of road safety measures in three categories (infrastructure, vehicles and users) and expressed its support for a comprehensive analysis of road safety measures which would consider the road traffic system in its entirety. In order to illustrate the need to take account of the areas of overlap between the three categories, the Commission pointed out in particular that certain adjustments to infrastructure might lead to an increase in accidents because of the additional risks that drivers might take.</p>
<p>However, the cost-effectiveness analysis referred to in the communication of 17 March 2000 has indeed made it possible to determine that, inter alia, the Union ought to set itself the short- and medium-term priority of establishing ‘guidelines’ for devising ‘forgiving’ road infrastructures and making improvements to ‘black spots’. These guidelines should be based on the best practices applied in the Member States. Preliminary studies have been conducted to determine the methodology to be adopted. In all likelihood, a call for proposals for the drafting of the guidelines proper will be issued. In this respect, studies could be funded under budget line B2-702 (transport safety), subject to the availability of resources. It is too early to say exactly what resources could be earmarked for these studies, which in any event cannot cover specific work on enhancing existing infrastructure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0385"></a>

<p>The Black Sea Greeks who have returned to Greece from the former Soviet Union – over a hundred thousand to date – face enormous problems.

The percentages of those who are unemployed (30%), in part-time work and in work for which they are over-qualified are much higher than those for the rest of the population, while large numbers face serious problems in relation to recognition of Greek nationality and of previous employment giving rise to pension rights.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that within the framework of the Community employment programme there is provision for funding to support specific activities connected with similar problems (e.g. the NOW, HORIZON and YOUTH START programmes), could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has applied for funding for initiatives to improve the living conditions and the full economic and social integration of returning Black Sea Greeks?

<p>Action for Greek repatriates from Pontos has been financed in the context of the 1994-1999 Community Support Framework (CSF) for Greece under the Operational Programme “Combating Exclusion from the Labour Market”. This action included pre-training and in particular Greek language teaching, training and accompanying/support measures i.e. psychological and social support. Moreover, the development of structures for the promotion of employment and accompanying/support services for Greek repatriates and migrants was also financed. According to information provided by the Greek authorities a total of approximately EUR 28 m has been spent on action in favour of Greek repatriates from Pontos. It is estimated that 5 510 persons benefited from this action.</p>
<p>Under the 2000-2006 Community Support Framework for Greece, the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> policy field of the<span class="sup"> </span>European Social Fund Regulation which aims at promoting equal opportunities for all in accessing the labour market with particular emphasis on those exposed to exclusion will provide the main framework for action in favour of the specific population group. As relevant negotiations have only just started, it is still not possible to give any specific information on the credits to be allocated for action under the specific policy field. However, there will be provision for action promoting labour market integration and social inclusion for Greek repatriates from Pontos.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Employment Community Initiative the following projects respecting Greek-Pontic refugees from the former USSR were approved:</p>
<p>1. Horizon axis 1995-1998:</p>
<p>10 projects amounting to EUR 5 252 586 (GRD 1 587 920 000) were approved and have already been completed. These projects were transnational and innovative and included actions aimed at the development of Refugees’ Support Centres, Vocational Training, the subsidising of Employment and dissemination practices. Approximately 650 refugees were involved in the aforementioned actions.</p>
<p>2. Integra axis 1997-2000:</p>
<p>20 projects amounting to EUR 8 738 458 (GRD 2 716 000 000) were approved. These projects are still under way. However, a substantial number of actions will already have been completed by the end of 2000.

<p>Could the Commission indicate when it will amend Directive 81/851 in order to deliver on the Commission Decision and if the amendment takes some time, can the Commission confirm that Member States should operate according to the spirit of the Commission Decision pending the logistical process of amending Directive 81/851?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Through its Decision 2000/68/EC<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>, the Commission has recently decided to amend the provisions for the establishment of the horse identification document (passport) in order amongst others things, to:</p>
<p>- Extend the scope of animals that should be accompanied by an identification document;</p>
<p>- Request, within this document, additional information on the intended future of the animal (as regards its possible slaughter for human consumption) and on the medicinal treatment administered to the horse.</p>
<p>In the 8<span class="sup">th</span> recital accompanying its Decision 2000/68/EC, the Commission mentions that it considers amending Article 1 of Directive 81/851/EEC<a href="#defann_39_4" name="refann_39_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. This consideration refers only to a possibility, but does not prejudge any final Commission decision on this issue.</p>
<p>The Commission is still considering the possibility for a holistic approach for amending the current legislative framework for veterinary medicinal products (mainly Directive 81/851/EEC), in order to try to solve as a whole the availability problems of medicinal products intended to be used in horses and in all the other so called “minor species”.</p>
<p>The procedure for a final decision on a proposal to amend Directive 81/851/EEC in such a context would take some time. However, as long as the regulatory framework has not been changed, the Commission cannot confirm that the Member States should operate according to the perspective for a possible change. By doing so the Commission would prejudge the outcome of the final decision of the Parliament and the Council. In addition, when assessing the measures taken by the Member States, the Commission has in particular to ensure that public health is not put at risk.</p>
<p>However, once a possible proposal to amend legislation has been adopted by the Commission, the Commission will take account of this situation when appraising provisions taken by the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

If so, is the Commission aware of the need to make the Indian authorities aware, in an explicit and concrete manner, of its willingness to do this? Furthermore, is the Commission aware of the adverse, and indeed dissuasive, effect that the introduction of an increasing number of political, social and environmental criteria into economic and commercial negotiations, including the WTO negotiations, is having on the development of Euro-Indian relations? Does the Commission not consider that these political, social and environmental issues, the importance of which is not disputed here, should be dealt with by separate and pragmatic discussions and should, in no case, be used by one or other of the parties as a means of halting the development of a strategic relationship between India and the European Union?

<p>The Commission’s policy towards Asia is based on the principles of comprehensive engagement, dialogue and consultation both with individual countries and with regional organisations such as ASEM, ASEAN and the SAARC. It does not regard its relations with the region as having a centre of gravity founded in any single country.</p>
<p>As regards China, the Commission seeks to establish a relationship based on mutual respect and benefits. A strategy of comprehensive engagement aiming to help China embrace universal human rights standards, comply with multilateral trading rules, and take a positive attitude towards global challenges such as sustainable development and arms control, constitutes the best way of advancing the EU’s interests and values.</p>
<p>As to India, the Commission has made substantial efforts to strengthen and intensify its relationship with the world’s largest democracy. The EU concluded a far-reaching cooperation agreement in 1993 and drafted a Communication on an enhanced partnership, which was well received by the European Parliament. The Commission is also currently preparing the first ever EU-India Summit to take place in Lisbon in June. This follows a marked warming of political contacts brought about by the visit of the Indian FM Singh to the Commission in September 99 and a successful Ministerial meeting in Helsinki in December 1999.</p>
<p>Upgrading the relationship with China and India should thus not be seen as mutually exclusive. Both nations are equally important, emerging political actors on the regional and international stage with whom the Commission seeks to intensify contacts across the board.</p>
<p>The honourable Member expresses concern that the EU’s position on the role of environmental and social issues in the WTO round may have a negative impact on our relationship with India. The Commission is alive to the concerns expressed not just by India but by other developing countries.</p>
<p>After Seattle, the responsible Member of the Commission has been engaged in intensive talks with the Indians (and others) on these matters. We have told the Indians that we want the new round to contribute to sustainable, rather than unsustainable, development. The Commission has clearly rejected any call for unilateral, protectionist measures in the environmental field and the use of trade sanctions in the area of trade and labour.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that environment is already part of the WTO system. It is only natural that, in the framework of a comprehensive, global round, the Commission may want to seek clarifications and improvements of the existing rules on environment.</p>
<p>The question of labour is different. Precisely in response to India’s and others’ opposition to bringing these matters within the WTO, the Commission is proposing to establish a regular dialogue between the WTO and other relevant institutions, notably the ILO. This dialogue would not be part of the new round. This should contribute to assuage India’s concerns. India has recently agreed to formally open an environmental dialogue with the EC.</p>
<p>The Commission is hopeful that India will join the camp of those developing countries that are slowly moving from outright opposition towards a more open-minded approach concerning these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0407"></a>

<p>Since 1994, the LIFE programme has been funding a project for the restoration of the alignments of standing stones at Carnac, implemented by the Ministry of Culture which manages the site.</p>
<p>This project is intended to conserve the site that has for years been under threat due to excessive tourism which has caused soil erosion serious enough to unseat the menhirs. The project includes organising public access entailing closure of the site at certain times of year, the relocation of some traffic routes and parking areas, and the demolition of some buildings. The ‘Archeoscope’ to which the honourable Member refers, however, is a private initiative unrelated to the project.</p>
<p>There has been a public inquiry into the works planned as part of the LIFE Project and a Declaration of Public Interest was issued by the County Governor of Morbihan on 10 July 1997. These were delayed several times in order to take the comments put forward by the local population and local authorities into consideration. There have, therefore, been many opportunities for local associations to be consulted in relation to the project.</p>
<p>Subject to evaluation of the results of the project, it does seem to have kept to its site conservation objectives, and so, at this stage, there are no grounds for considering withdrawing Community funding.</p>

<p>The Finnish and Swedish Governments, together with the Kvarken region, agreed on temporary aid to maintain ferry traffic for a two-year period from 1 September 1999 to 31 August 2001, in accordance with EU rules on state aid for maritime transport, when duty-free sales came to an end.</p>

<p>Ferry traffic in the Kvarken straits between Sweden and Finland has declined by approximately 30% since duty-free sales were abolished. This is causing employment problems in the region. Before the abolition of duty-free sales, Commissioner Monti claimed that it would be possible for this to be offset by increased employment in the regular retail trade.

<p>The Commission always recognised that the decision to abolish duty­free sales for intra­Community travellers might have an adverse impact on certain regions. Its analysis<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> showed that this impact was likely to be time limited and specific in terms both of localities and sectors affected. As a peripheral region heavily dependent upon ferry traffic, it was estimated that the Kvarken region, and more particularly the ferry services between the county of Västerbotten in Sweden and the Ostrobothnian counties in Finland<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>, could be adversely affected by the abolition. From the information presented by the Honourable Members, indicating a decrease in passenger volume of 30%, it seems that these predictions might have come true.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, considered the proposed extension of the duty­free arrangements, even if limited to certain sectors, too broad an instrument to address specific problems arising from the abolition of duty­free sales. Instead, it considered that these were most efficiently addressed within the framework of existing Community instruments, namely the Structural and Cohesion Funds and State aid. Under the procedures in place, only Member States can put forward proposals for specific measures or for re­balancing existing programme measures to alleviate such problems. Accordingly, the Commission urged Member States to exploit fully the possibility offered by submitting specific funding proposals.</p>
<p>Sweden and Finland have decided to avail themselves of the State aid scheme, considering the ferry service in the Gulf of Bothnia as a public­service interest. This allows for public procurement of the Kvarken ferry route. This measure has been endorsed by the Commission as being in line with the Community guidelines on State aid to the maritime transport industries.</p>
<p>Regarding structural funds, the Swedish and Finnish proposals for the Objective 1 and 2 regional development programmes for 2000­2006 in Kvarken do not include concrete plans to support ferry connections. However, Sweden and Finland have jointly proposed a cross­border INTERREG III Community Initiative programme for the Kvarken­Mittskandia area which the Commission received on 28 April 2000. This proposal includes ferry traffic as one of the key issues for the area. Clearly, the Commission is not able to pronounce an opinion on the programme at this stage, in advance of the start of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any instances of misuse of dominant position by other ferry lines in the Gulf of Bothnia caused by subsidies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission sees no reason to consider again the issue of duty­free sales, an issue which the Council unanimously decided in 1991 and 1992 and affirmed in 1999 nor does it see any justification for special tax rules to be applied on a regional basis. It considers that divergent rules such as lower rates would contradict general principles laid down in Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concerns expressed about the conservation of endangered species. Whilst it can do little about the management of this question in situ, it does have a role to play when European Union citizens are involved. Under Community wildlife trade legislation (Regulation 338/97) an import permit is required before any hunting trophies can be brought into the Community. This import permit can only be issued when scientists in the importing Member State are satisfied that the import would not have a harmful effect on the conservation of the species concerned.</p>
<p>As regards grizzly bears from British Columbia, Community scientists have formed a positive opinion with respect to allowing imports of such hunting trophies. They consider that properly managed trophy hunting can make a positive contribution to the overall conservation of wildlife in North-western America. The Commission is confident that the Canadian authorities are controlling the Community in such a manner that there is no danger to the balanced development of the Grizzly Bear population.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0428"></a>

<p>In view of the positive effects of the improvement plans and their low impact on the budget, and given that the EU is deficient in such products and therefore highly dependent on external markets, can the Commission say whether or not it intends to continue or establish other measures which will compensate for this loss of aid to the dried fruit sector?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Specific aid has been granted to the nut sector for 10 years under the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2159/89. Additional specific flat­rate aid for hazelnuts has been granted since 1997 and up to the year 2000.</p>
<p>The main objective of this aid was to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the nut sector.</p>
<p>Community expenditure on the sector has been very significant. EUR 725 m have been spent on improvement plans in the period 1990­1999. For those plans still in operation a further EUR 250 m are foreseen until 2006.</p>
<p>It has always been understood that this aid is temporary and degressive. In this way, financial responsibility could be shifted on to the growers.</p>
<p>Therefore, no extension of this aid is foreseen. However, other support schemes are available.</p>
<p>Firstly, aid is available for nuts through the operational fund scheme of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. This provides financial support for all fruit and vegetables marketed through producer organisations.</p>
<p>In addition, Member States can include nuts in their rural development plans under conditions of Regulation (EC) No 1257/99. This would help address the environmental and social aspects of nut production.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the conditions for undergoing selection procedures for recruitment to posts at the EU institutions is that the applicant should not be above a certain age: a translator, for example, must not be aged over 45. Irrespective of their training, competence and work experience, therefore, applicants seeking selection for employment by the EU suffer discrimination on grounds of age. This is despite the fact that the EU claims to be trying to combat discrimination on grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, religious or other conviction, disability, age and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why this age discrimination persists within the EU’s own institutions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission made a decision in principle to abolish age limits in competition notices in January 1998. As a first step it began by raising the age limit for all staff recruitment competitions at basic grades to 45, following the approach adopted by the Bureau of this Parliament in October 1997. During inter­Institutional discussions on the Reflection Group report on Personnel Policy, the other Institutions also expressed their willingness in principle to raise the age limit to 45.</p>
<p>In the Commission, the higher age limit has applied to all relevant competitions launched since that time, including the large­scale graduate competitions held last year (COM A/8­12/98) and a number of others, such as the competitions for informaticians and secretaries.</p>
<p>The honourable Member may be interested to know that, in spite of the introduction of the higher age limit in the large-scale graduate competitions ­ where there were 30 000 applicants ­ the relatively young age profile of applicants remained almost the same as on previous occasions. We continue to take the view, however, that ­ in due course ­ raising and ultimately abolishing the age limit could begin to make a positive difference by encouraging applications from more mature candidates who obviously may have much to offer the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission also periodically organises competitions for intermediate grades and for specialist posts at A5/A4 level where the current age limit is 50 years.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will be aware that not all of the Institutions necessarily share the Commission’s determination to completely abolish age limits. I therefore wrote recently to the Presidents of the other Institutions underlining the Commission’s commitment to abolish age limits, and asking the other Institutions to review their position in the light of the anti-discrimination clause in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the light of the Commission’s recent experience. The Commission hopes for quick and real progress on this issue, and naturally, I will continue to keep the House informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
