<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – I wish to give you some current information. Last week, there was another earthquake in Turkey. There were further deaths, almost 700 people, and increased material losses in the region, which had already suffered in an earthquake three weeks ago. Our thoughts are with our Turkish friends. Last week’s floods in Italy and southern France also caused fatalities and considerable material damage. We appreciate the efforts of the emergency services and local authorities, which are helping the people affected by these disasters. We are deeply saddened and feel great sympathy for the families which fell victim to these disasters and for missing persons, and also sympathise with those who have lost all their belongings and are homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">The second brief piece of information I wish to impart is that, at the end of October, I visited Libya. I met the President, ministers and representatives of civil society. We discussed the building of democracy and a market economy. They are very much relying on Europe’s help, be it in teaching them democratic principles, building independent democratic institutions, or ensuring the functioning of structures within those institutions. They are very open to collaboration; they cannot, of course, be forced to do anything, but they are very willing to talk about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been in Tunisia, where I met the Prime Minister, the Head of the Central Bank and the leaders of the four political parties which won the elections, and therefore those who were first on the list. There, too, there is complete openness to the European Union. I was told that ‘We have no other choice. Our choice is the European Union’. I talked with them about creating a democratic state based on the rule of law and full access by all people, including women, to all possible public activities and to the exploitation of all opportunities in an open society. All four of the parties that won the elections are ready to create a democratic Tunisia on these lines and also to cooperate with Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also spent almost a week in the Western Balkans: in Croatia, which is entering the EU, and also in Serbia, which recently introduced far-reaching reforms and where the main problem is the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. I was also in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the internal stalemate is coming to an end. I also visited Srebrenica, where I laid a wreath and, on behalf of the entire European Parliament, expressed deep sympathy for all the victims’ families. I believe that Srebrenica is a place that every European should visit. It is a very important place to remind us of what a lack of openness and understanding leads to.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to inform you of three current issues. This coming Wednesday, we will hold a priority debate. The President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, and the President of the Eurogroup and Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Juncker, have decided to take part in this debate. This is a very important debate, as we are aware, and I encourage all of you to attend it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another piece of information is the fact that, today at 15.00, the plenary session of the Euro-Med Scola youth parliament came to an end. It was attended by representatives from 40 countries, and thus by young members of parliament from 40 countries in the Mediterranean region, including most EU Member States. They worked in five working groups: social dialogue and engagement; migration and integration; equal opportunities; environment, transport and renewable energy; and education and employment. They raised many of the same issues that we discuss on a daily basis: civil society, social dialogue, true equality in access to education, broad environmental protection, and achieving a balance in North Africa and the Middle East with the gradual development of a more affluent society, which is so difficult in some countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be proud of this responsibility for the future of the whole Mediterranean region. I wish to inform you that our young friends are now with us in the gallery. I warmly welcome these 250 people from the Mediterranean region – a parliament which has met in this hall over two days. Yesterday and today, these young people surrounding us now were sitting in your places. We warmly welcome you!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Another piece of information I have for you is that I wish to invite you to take part in the high-level human rights conference which will take place at the European Parliament on 23 November. This will also be a meeting of Sakharov prize winners. The attendance of 12 prize winners has been confirmed. Perhaps not everybody will be able to attend for various reasons, but it seems that they would very much like to be there with us. There will be a broad discussion with human rights activists from all over the world. This conference will last all day on 23 November at the European Parliament, and at the end of the day, there will be an open meeting with Brussels residents at the Bozar Centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the sad news of the death of Willy De Clercq. This European and Belgian statesman has left us. For a quarter of a century, he was a Member of the European Parliament and presided over the Group of Liberals and one of Parliament’s committees. He also held the offices of Commissioner and Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium. On behalf of the European Parliament, I offer our sincere condolences to Willy De Clercq’s family. I would ask you to rise and observe a minute’s silence in memory of our colleague. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">[Wednesday]</span>:</p>
<p class="contents">All political groups have agreed on the following order of business for Wednesday afternoon:</p>
<p class="contents">Item 1: Statement on the EU-US Summit</p>

<p class="contents">Item 3: Oral questions concerning the Roma</p>

<p class="contents">Two changes have been introduced:</p>
<p class="contents">The first change has been agreed with all the political groups: the Commission’s statement on the contribution of the common fisheries policy to the production of public goods has been removed from the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The second change has also been agreed with all the political groups: as regards the Fleckenstein report on the European Maritime Safety Agency, the vote on which is currently scheduled for Thursday, the political groups have agreed that this item should not be put to vote during this part-session but at the part-session on 30 November and 1 December. This item will therefore be voted on two weeks later. This has been agreed by all the political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to thank Mr Kuhn, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, Mr Zīle, Mr Cramer and Ms Wils. I would also like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, the parliamentary group coordinators and all of my colleagues for the extensive debate we have had on a report that was particularly complex but also, I believe, important for the implementation of the railway system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a recast of the first railway package, which has not been correctly applied since its entry into force, and, in fact, 13 infringement procedures against Member States relating to implementation of the first railway package are currently under way. The objective of the railway recast is to achieve a single European railway market. It is an ambitious objective because the rail system is the most outdated transport system, which has not managed to catch up with other modes of transport. For example, the average percentage for rail freight in European countries is stationary at around 6-7%, while only 11-12% of passengers travel by rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is clear that rules need to be harmonised, and that new systems and new elements need to be added and strengthened to ensure that railways can develop properly, particularly where they cross borders, which is the most problematic part for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a single European market is therefore necessary, just as it was for the air transport sector. The creation of a single market will mean that citizens can use trains that can run throughout Europe, with better fares and a service on a par with that of other modes of transport. Currently, few trains can travel outside national borders. Now the aim is that they can compete with each other throughout the whole of Europe, something which – as I have said – is not the case today.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives which the first railway package attempted to deliver are therefore the aim of this recast and of all the measures for unification of the rail system that will follow. This means that, starting with the railway recast, some rules need to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important points that we have discussed at length, and which I believe is also the key product of the railway recast, is the provision of a national regulatory body, a network of national regulatory bodies with clear responsibilities, a strong national regulatory body with resources like the energy regulator, which could – as many hope – allow us to have a single European regulatory body in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to provide clear rules for transparency and separation of the accounts of the infrastructure manager and the services manager, by prohibiting cross transfers between the network and the services manager as happens in the case of many holding companies, for example. We have tried to maintain the separation of accounts that has been in force since 1991, according to which public funds for infrastructures must be used solely to improve infrastructure and not to finance the business of transport companies, also because these subsidies prevent fair competition between all the service operators.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur I would have liked the railway package to be more ambitious. I would also have liked there to be a total separation between infrastructure and service operators. However, we have been given a commitment by the Commission that this will be put in place by 31 December 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important provisions concern ease of access to infrastructures, which is essential in order to guarantee that all new operators can use network services, and in addition to total separation, the Commission has made a commitment to present a proposal for national market liberalisation by 31 December 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also included benefits for operators that introduce significant technological innovations to reduce environmental impact, and we have included the possibility of an improvement in the sector by allowing 7-year instead of 5-year strategic plans as previously. Finally, we wanted to guarantee compliance with laws governing employment rights and safety in the workplace, and to maintain the right to strike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission will present its work programme for 2012 tomorrow. I have already confirmed on several occasions my intention to propose further substantial reform in the rail sector next year. Let me be clear at the outset that I do not seek change for change’s sake, but rather because we need to strengthen rail to ensure it offers attractive services, capable of playing a substantial role in the transport of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">But rail will only fulfil its potential if rail companies are innovative, cost-efficient and forward-looking. Although the Commission has been seeking this for the past two decades, change has been very slow. So next year’s package will revitalise the process, with proposals to open domestic passenger markets and review related public service obligation rules, with further structural change to ensure fair competitive conditions for newcomers and a refinement of the rules on standards and certification of rolling stock to make the approvals process quicker and more cost effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Completion of work on the current proposal, the recast, is a precondition for the 2012 package. I am fully aware that discussions in both Council and Parliament proved to be difficult and subject to intense lobbying from various stakeholders. They demonstrated that rail remains a conservative sector. In some cases, some of the principles and rules already agreed ten years ago have been challenged in an attempt to undermine ongoing infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: the status quo – or even worse, backward steps – is not an option!</p>
<p class="contents">A large majority of the 133 amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport (TRAN) are acceptable to the Commission, even though in some cases subject to certain redrafting. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that some specific amendments voted in TRAN and others now tabled to the plenary would substantially weaken the Commission proposal. These amendments would be a step backward compared to the text agreed by Council and even compared to existing law, which is not acceptable for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me insist on some of these:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the issue of separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings will be subject to new proposals at the end of 2012 and therefore, all amendments in relation to Articles 6 and 7 are premature. The new provisions on separation of accounts are contrary to the principle of financial transparency and (at least as drafted) extremely difficult for the regulators to control.</p>
<p class="contents">The result would be that state money paid to support the infrastructure could instead leak to an incumbent train operator, giving it an unfair competitive advantage – and, at the same time, diminishing the funds available for investment by infrastructure managers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, debt write-off by Member States can only relate to so-called historical debt incurred before market opening.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the recast proposal does not modify the fundamental principles of infrastructure charging; it simply clarifies how these principles must be applied. New exemptions to infrastructure charging cannot be justified by any objective criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, national regulators must have the possibility to fulfil their oversight functions, including for cross-border traffic, and prevent problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, experience shows that the competence of national regulators must be extended. However, some amendments would restrict their interventions to cases of discrimination and impede interventions to correct other undesirable distortions of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, Amendments 126 and 127 are problematic. The first would undermine the direct cost charging principle; the second would put an unnecessary administrative burden on infrastructure managers.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, amendments restricting or removing powers for the Commission to adopt delegated or implementing acts often relate to non-essential elements. We need to make technical adjustments which, practically, should not be done in codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I also need to draw your attention to the 2001 interinstitutional agreement on recasting. This agreement establishes a discipline to guarantee interinstitutional equilibrium, the right of initiative of the Commission and the right to make use of recasting as a key instrument for better law making.</p>

She has performed a truly Herculean task in injecting a new impetus into a stagnating process that has seen almost no progress over the last 10 years, at least as far as the first railway package is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that we should mobilise cross-border traffic and that competition should be permitted in the rail sector, which is also why we in Parliament are concentrating on the key points in relation to the proposal from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first key point I should like to make: we need a strong, independent regulator, a regulatory authority that ensures fair competitive conditions to ensure that all approved railway companies are given access to the network and can provide transport services there. The decisions made there cannot be put off for 12, 24 or even 60 months. They need to be made promptly, preferably within a month, determining who is to be approved and who is to be allowed to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second consideration is the financing of the necessary infrastructural measures. This is a decisive point and, as Mr Leichtfried has already said, we would call upon the Council to agree to provide the necessary level of funding to enable the infrastructure to be developed, whether this involves the laying of track or the installation of signalling systems, Electric Monorail Transport Systems (EMTS) and safety. Another very important point: we believe that the seven years mentioned by Ms Serracchiani are very important.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the calculation of track access charges: we support fair conditions for all, a clear definition of the various components of the infrastructure; in other words, which costs are fixed and which are variable, as well as the transparency of the financial flow between infrastructure operators and railway companies<span class="italic">.</span> We regard this as a crucial point. However, when capital is invested, it is always necessary to ensure that companies can service reasonable interest repayments from the revenue generated from track access prices. We cannot proceed here solely along dogmatic and ideological lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We need electronic ticketing and interoperability going forward and this is precisely what we are asking for from the Commission. People should stop trying to hide behind technical barriers. Safety with EMTS, noise abatement – the aim is to get more freight and more passengers travelling by rail, enabling us to work in an ecologically rational way using little energy and enjoying excellent distribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This dossier, that you and the shadow rapporteurs have brought to a successful conclusion, is technical, complex and controversial. Obviously, there is still more work to be done as the negotiations with the Council are yet to take place. Somebody has already mentioned that, next year, we will have a ruling from the Court of Justice with respect to a number of infringement procedures – which is not unimportant – we are expecting a Fourth Railway Package which will address several issues that we have so far been unable to settle within this framework, in particular, the liberalisation of domestic passenger transport and perhaps even a decision on the prohibition of integrated structures and, hence, a strict separation between infrastructure manager and operator.</p>
<p class="contents">To be honest, I think it is a good thing that we are putting off that package for a while. It is a very controversial package. We need to study its impact properly. I also think that we need to test it carefully against our objectives, namely, the creation of a European railway area where the quality of service for passengers will remain intact and where employees will be able to work under good conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, this recast is, in itself, very important, because several things will be clarified. The recast limits the Member States’ room for manoeuvre, the opportunities open to them in terms of interpreting the application of the First Package. In practice, that will translate into greater harmonisation of the operation of the railway transport market in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing this by substantially strengthening the regulator and, in the long term, by working towards the establishment of a European regulator. There will also be more transparency as regards levies, money flows, and more guarantees for the financing of rail infrastructure by imposing long-term commitments on the Member States. What I also find positive, Ms Serracchiani, is that the right to strike will be retained. However, that is something that we first have to regulate at the national level. In brief, a small step forward, but a very important step in the realisation of a European railway area for the sectors concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a very technical dossier. We have been working for a year in the Committee on Transport dealing with nearly 800 amendments. The Liberals have tried to maintain coherence in all the debates during this year. This has been difficult because the two big groups in this House are divided on some key points.</p>
<p class="contents">The unbundling issue, which was not proposed by the Commission but by the rapporteur, has held up the process for months and has monopolised the debates and the final vote of this recast.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals proposed to take the unbundling issue out from the recast and call the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal on this issue after having an impact assessment and after full stakeholder consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals believe that the main problem of the European single railway area is a problem of openness much more than a problem of model organisation between integrated and separated models.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a Mediterranean liberal. I am a Catalan liberal. I come from a Mediterranean country in which there is no real openness and no real competition on freight transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the first debate, the Liberals have proposed the creation of a European regulatory body – not to create more bureaucracy or to intervene in countries where there is a national regulatory body that is efficient and strong in terms of budget and staff. The European regulator should intervene in countries in which the national regulator is not doing its job. We need a red telephone at European level to deal quickly with international competition problems in the railway sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Liberals will vote against Article 6(4). The control by regulators over the revenues of infrastructure managers of railway undertakings is not so clear, so this clause could still be used for business and could create competition distortions. We are in favour of more transparency in this clause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, are in favour of the opening up of the networks on ecological grounds rather than ideological ones. We need to shift traffic from road to rail in order to halt climate change and save the planet.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from experience with freight transport that countries that have opened up their railway networks have had a positive experience in this regard, with the United Kingdom reporting a 60% increase, the Netherlands 40%, Poland 30% and Germany 25%. In the case of those countries who refused to listen and who waited until the last moment to change, this traffic has now moved to the roads and the jobs are gone – France, for example, has recorded a decline of 28%. That must not happen again. That is why we favour opening up the networks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that the European Court of Justice will decide which model should be chosen, in other words, whether we should follow the Spanish model of strictly separating network and operation, while maintaining a closed network, or whether we should copy other countries like Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany, where a link still exists. This is for the European Court of Justice to decide and for the Commission to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I also have a question for the Commission. Why have you waited more than 10 years, standing idly by while existing European laws were continuously flouted? You should have taken action sooner. I do not mean you personally, Mr Vice-President. However, the Commission as a whole has watched quietly for far too long while agreements were violated and laws were broken.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want now is a strict regulatory authority. We know that this is crucial. We need a body that is strong, that makes decisions quickly, and that remains impartial. We know that a decision must be taken within two weeks in Germany and within two months in Italy if the questionnaire is completed correctly. Since this is rarely if ever the case, nothing is going to happen there. It will take at least two years to get an answer in France. For this reason, we need a strict regulatory authority that reaches decisions quickly, is independent and that guarantees openness.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a European railway network rather than a nationalistic operation. Such an arrangement is a thing of the past, but we need to look to the future.</p>

<p class="contents">We know that Italy is involved in three major projects in which cofinancing has still not been secured.

What we want is efficiency as quickly as possible in order to save the climate. We have no time to lose. For this reason, we do not oppose these major projects in themselves, but rather it is our wish that the money should be put to better use. This applies not just to the Lyon-Turin project, but also to Stuttgart 21. We have witnessed this scenario in Germany before: construction goes on for 20 years, then the money dries up and we have gained nothing. This must be avoided.

I should also like to express my gratitude for the great understanding shown during the many rounds of negotiations on a specific market segment that exists on the European railways, the so-called Russian 1520 mm gauge. Thank you again for this understanding (which, as we are well aware, is relatively close to the standpoint of the Union on the matter) on many specific issues. First of all, it pertains to imposing a ceiling on infrastructure charges, capacity allocation schedules and modernisation requirements for track vehicles, i.e. rolling stock. Therefore, I am really grateful for this understanding and I truly hope that, despite the conflicting viewpoints we have heard today, we shall be able to vote this week on a balanced proposal, on which we could then find a compromise with the Council.

The integrated public railway companies are to be destroyed by allowing subcontracts to be awarded and marshalling yards and maintenance works to be privatised and operated by private businesses from outside the railway industry. Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety.

<p class="contents">I have to say that we have tried to improve the efficiency of the rail transport market. The text proposes the creation of a single European railway area. Expectations were high, but after a year of work, I believe they have been considerably reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Analysis of the situation has shown that we are a long way from having a single, integrated market, and the liberalisation of national and regional passenger traffic markets in particular is still not recognised by this Parliament. We are talking about 60% of the railway market which is not actually free at the moment. Personally, I am amazed by the lukewarm approach to an issue that concerns one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union. Given that, in the current circumstances, we need to focus on growth, I wonder how it is possible not to remove the administrative obstacles preventing the development of competition and the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">The same fate has befallen treatment of the relationship between the infrastructure managers and the rail companies. In this connection, I tabled an amendment to Annex I requesting the inclusion of passenger stations under infrastructures in order to have fair and equal access for all those providing passenger services. This is important, otherwise we would start off with an incorrect division. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a tough task for her, as this really is a difficult portfolio.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the first railway package was established 10 years ago, when all Member States agreed on how the railway market in Europe could be opened up. The crazy thing is that a review carried out in 2009 indicated that only four states had actually met the provisions contained in the package. Two countries do not count as they do not have a rail network. The remainder have failed to stick to their own resolutions. This is why we need to take action once again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that we need a comprehensive railway sector in Europe, both in the interests of the internal market and in the interests of our citizens. What we find is not just gaps in the rail lines and incompatible systems, but also legal and organisational hurdles. It is these hurdles that we have tried to eliminate here. The good news is that we now have a strong regulator at European and national level. This regulator must be independent and must also be able to take action quickly. A lot of people have said this. We have also noticed that although the separation of networks and operators may be the right solution, a lot of comparisons are required in order to establish the nature of this separation and to ensure that we have a consistent system throughout Europe. This is something that will need urgent attention next year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe disagree with – Mr Tremosa has already pointed it out and we have also asked for a separate vote on this issue – and that is Article 6(4). Mr Kuhn has already indicated that he wants transparency in relation to the financial flow. We do not want to see public monies being invested in areas other than infrastructure. This is not assured by the current wording, however. This is why we really do need to vote against the last section, as otherwise we shall have no transparency. This is not in the interest of progress in the rail market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is where we need to win market share.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the difficult debate on the complete separation of infrastructure and operations has been postponed until a later date, not least because – in my country anyway, which is a small country with a very dense network – separating them to too great an extent has resulted in much disruption and many additional costs, without bringing any new benefits or new entrants. What is the point of it, then? There are not really enough new entrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that what we clearly need is a strong and independent regulator. We need a separation, but we also need essential functions. We should look at it function by function and not ideologically, so as to see which functions actually need to be separated. When one goes so far as to say, for example, that IT services or human resources should be separated, I do not really see how that will help create economies of scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to rail services, I believe that, on this issue too, my colleague, Mr Cramer, and I tabled an amendment to Article 13. If a workshop does not have the residual capacity to accept a new request, why should we try to force it to accept it, unless we want to disrupt the work it is already doing or the service it is already providing?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that some interesting work has been done. A huge amount of work awaits us, and there are a few points here where I feel the text could still be improved slightly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, in 2002, we separated infrastructure management from goods transport by rail and thus succeeded in stopping, and turning around, many years of decline in goods transport. As a result, we again had prospects of real growth and opportunities for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">With the recast of the First Railway Package, the European Commission also wants to continue with the liberalisation. However, when it comes to this issue, this Parliament has managed to discuss everything except genuine liberalisation. I believe that is a missed opportunity. Too many speakers have been too ready to listen to protectionist railways, to poorly functioning national railway companies or to railway unions, the low point being the last sentence of Amendment 53, whereby infrastructure managers continue to be too closely linked financially to freight operators. Therefore, this is no real separation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore voting against this report despite the rapporteur’s good work. There are still too many old-fashioned protectionist attitudes in the railway sector – in the majority of this House. This means that the future of goods transport by rail will be brought to a standstill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even the rapporteurs admit that the volume of freight is falling, while road transport, which emits millions of tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span>, has gained even more ground. Infrastructure is in a state of collapse due to the lack of financing. In a ridiculous attempt to compete with air transport, we are prioritising high speed at the expense of local service frequency and of the regional network effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation results in fewer and fewer services for users. Despite some very timid statements of principle regarding employment conditions, the proposal being made to us, once again, is that rail companies should be further broken up. This is counterproductive and very dangerous for rail safety. It disregards, in the name of liberal dogma, a decades-old culture of rail workers and rail techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, instead, is for integrated national public rail companies to be rebuilt; this should include everything from infrastructure to the specification of equipment, and should also take in the passenger and freight sectors and research and development. Then, starting from there, we will be able to build a European public rail hub in the form of an economic interest grouping.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding for major rail infrastructure could be provided by the European Investment Bank. The Europe of the railways should not be intended as a centre in which a few groups make a profit. Rather, it should be aimed at meeting the mobility needs of European citizens and the need to transport safe, environmentally friendly materials: goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It ensures mobility and transport of people and goods, invigorates the economy and promotes territorial cohesion. By its very nature and character, this sector calls for long-term investment and long-term development strategies, pursuing aims which have to do with the public interest and public service and are incompatible with the mercantile outlook represented by this railway package.</p>
<p class="contents">This package puts business interests before everything: private business profit supported by public investment. The break-up that is proposed here is tailor-made for the multinationals within the sector, which are already taking over rail transport and colonising the markets for related services in various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An instructive example is that of the German multinational DB, which controls more than 60% of European freight. The liberalisation of the sector has been to the disadvantage of the general public, which is left with fewer, inferior and more expensive services, and to the disadvantage of the workers, what with the increased exploitation of the workforce on a European scale, while safety standards are dangerously jeopardised, subordinated as they are to freedom of competition.</p>

Over the last few months, the matter of recasting the first railway package has been the main and perhaps the most difficult dossier with which the Committee on Transport and Tourism has had to deal. By adopting a series of compromise amendments, it has been possible to reach an agreement which demonstrates the determination of all political groups. We all wish to travel by train in a comfortable environment, safely, and as quickly as possible and, when we go to a station, to be able to buy, at one counter, a single ticket for connections involving different operators. We are determined to achieve that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, remember and be careful not to make mistakes. When aiming at free competition on the rail services market, we must remember that in some Member States, there are self-financed railways that do not link up to the national or European network, which have only industrial significance, and which operate on gauges which are different from the dominant one. The need to apply all the provisions of the directive to these separate lines, including unbundling, will result in a disproportionate and unreasonable burden and will disrupt and distort the purpose for which they have been developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask that, during the vote on Wednesday, you support Amendment 135 tabled by myself, Mr Marcinkiewicz and the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and signed by dozens of Members from various political groups and Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She and many others have poured plenty of cold water on this issue throughout discussions. Not everyone’s expectations have been met in full. That is the nature of any compromise, however.</p>
<p class="contents">This nine-year-old railway package has still not been implemented. That is why I have a difficulty when certain people here seek to convince us that what is happening with the railways today basically boils down to the liberalisation that failed to materialise nine years ago. This is a little absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">What was it that Parliament wanted to achieve? We wanted greater efficiency. We wanted to create space for the railways. We also wanted the railways of the future to have a bigger market share because we knew that this was necessary for many reasons in relation to passenger and road transport. This implementation has not taken place because, as I would argue, the railway has not been a top priority in many countries. I am convinced that even if we produce the best legislation, if the Council does not play ball tomorrow, despite our decisions, we will find other people standing here in five or 10 years time saying exactly the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been modest in our proposals. We wanted to address various topics. Our primary concern is that we should have a strong regulator who will respect the regulations as they now stand and who will organise the opening up of the market in such a way that the railways will have a greater market share, provide more jobs and achieve greater efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to funding and the relationship between service providers and infrastructure operators, I must honestly say that the discussions of recent weeks have been almost etymological in nature. What we wanted is actually quite simple: that public monies, or what has been paid for with public monies, should be paid back by the market not just through profits. These are subsidies and must be ring-fenced. I hope that this point will be understood in the Council and Commission tomorrow. We will then have a good basis for further discussions next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This shows how difficult it is to create a single railway area and a better, passenger friendly and simplified railway policy. We must remember, however, that any solution to this problem must take account of different management systems in this sector in the individual EU countries and different levels of railway development and infrastructure quality.

The package improves non-discriminatory access to service facilities, such as maintenance and repair or refuelling, and increases the transparency of the institutional framework of the rail market.

The first collection of regulations on railway transport in 2001 has not fulfilled the expectations of meaningful improvement and a significant increase in the attractiveness of the railway sector. Continuing differences in domestic regulations result in the fact that, while air or road transport extends beyond borders in an unhindered way, international railway services meet technical and legislative obstacles when they cross borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As such – if we plan to continue to build a common, integrated railway network – we have to harmonise the regulations governing transport over the Union’s railway network consistently. We can bring about an increase in the competitiveness of railway transport compared with road or air transport only by simplifying rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisational separation of the railway infrastructure network from the operators of transport and maintenance services will surely help in making the competitive environment in the railway sector more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is essential to think also about the precise distribution of responsibility, mainly regarding safety, between the participants contributing to the operation of the system as a whole. Railway transport is regarded as safe, but accidents on railway lines usually involve extensive damage. For this reason, it is necessary to collect data on these accidents at an EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When it comes to passenger transport, there is just one simple calculation required: train tickets must always be cheaper than the petrol costs for the same journey for one person. This unsatisfactory price/service ratio also depends on the market structure. As a network operation, rail travel constitutes a natural monopoly.

These compromise texts include Article 7, mentioned by the Commissioner, in which Parliament invites the Commission to make a proposal for national market separation and liberalisation by 31 December 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">None of the proposals are in any way premature – instead, there is a clear invitation with an equally clear and precise direction. If this direction had been present from the start, it would probably have helped with the management of this extremely long railway recast. In the meantime, my assistant has had a baby, so this really has been a long and complicated gestation period, but I am sure that we understand the importance of expanding the railway system.</p>
<p class="contents">We have said that we need a competitive railway system. In that case, we need to have rules. We do not necessarily need many rules, but they have to be clear, and to be complied with by everyone. We know that there is a problem of free competition on the railway market, particularly with regard to freight transport. The ambition of the railway recast is to create the single European market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are issuing a strong invitation to the Commission to make a clear proposal before the end of next year and, given that next year is so close, we propose that work should begin so that Parliament can fulfil its own legislative role, also because the text very recently issued by the Council is extremely cautious, including with regard to the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we hope that Parliament will give us a clear and full mandate to carry out a complete negotiation process that will truly open up the single European market to all the expectations to which – I am picking up on the shout of pain from Mr Cancian – we must provide a response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some Member States, there are certain lines with a different track gauge as a remnant of the old post-Soviet system, as a result of which these lines do not form part of the national or EU railway system. Such lines were deliberately built to meet regional needs in terms of the transport of goods from third countries. The length of these lines and the traffic on them are not usually included in the calculation of trains per kilometre for national transport purposes. Member States should therefore be able to exclude such lines and the operators serving them from the application of the directive. Consequently, together with Mr Zasada, I have tabled Amendment 135 in order to resolve the issues I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the liberalisation projects at EU level, rail transport never managed to gain ground vis-à-vis other modes of transport. One of the reasons for this may be that many countries have invested billions in their road infrastructure, so that funding for rail transport has suffered as a result. The high rail infrastructure costs in comparison with other modes of transport are, however, one of the greatest obstacles to combined transport. This makes it all the more important that flagship projects such as the development of the Baltic-Adriatic axis should be pushed forward. The Baltic-Adriatic axis is an international economic lifeline that will cater for the infrastructural development of the volume of transport that will move from road to rail in the coming decades, bringing with it new potential between north-eastern Europe and the Adriatic region. However, as we focus on cross-border passenger and combined transport, we should not forget about regional lines. After all, massive savings were achieved here over the last decade. If there are no regional connections to international and EU cross-border rail transport, then potential customers will be excluded. It is also necessary to prevent the risk that the liberalisation of rail transport could lead to a concentration on attractive main routes and a consequent decline in services to rural regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the desired objectives were not achieved for the following reasons: 1) the infrastructure’s insufficient and less prioritised financing in comparison with road transport; 2) the obstruction of competition; 3) the scarcity and ineffectiveness of supervisory organisations. The rapporteur initially proposed complete separation, i.e. the proprietor of the infrastructure and the organiser of the freight transport must not be one and the same organisation. This modification has been implemented in Estonia. This has, however, created great opposition, both in the TRAN Committee and in different political groups. At the moment, greater separation is recommended to Member States, but in order to achieve complete separation, the Commission would have to make a proposal based on research. At the same time, the opening of the domestic market in passenger transport to new entrants and their fair treatment is demanded, including in the establishment of infrastructure charges and the planning of travel times. One of the most important items for discussion is the further funding of infrastructure, in which there is a perceived need for greater public sector participation that would develop the EU’s rail network more extensively. This also sets recommended and permitted marginal rates for charges, which should guarantee all market participants equal treatment and sufficient funding for rail infrastructure. At the same time, the Baltic States are left with the opportunity to apply higher charges, since their rail width differs from that of the EU system, and their rail network is mainly used to transport third-country goods; to date, this desired practice has functioned well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want rail transport to stand up to the economic and environmental issues of the single market, it is imperative that we improve current legislation, which has given too much leeway to a market that is struggling to become less fragmented. At a time when the Commission is about to open domestic passenger transport to competition, regulations should no longer vary so widely from one Member State to another, as this risks increasing distortions of competition that already penalise passengers and certain railway undertakings. The new directive rightly aims to tackle these obstacles to competition by reinforcing the powers of national regulators, price transparency and the independence of infrastructure managers. I therefore urge those of you who want to organise free and non-distorted competition between railway operators, and to propose opportunities for alternative and more affordable rail transport to our fellow citizens, to adopt the recast of the railway package tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title17"></a><a name="creitem17"></a>

The issue of professional qualifications is very important and is one of the top priorities of the Single Market Act to boost growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is a great opportunity for Parliament to provide real input and focus for the Commission’s future legislative proposal due to be released on 13 December. First and foremost, I would like to thank my fellow shadows; I am extremely grateful for all the input they have provided throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, I have met with many different professionals, regulators, competent authorities and other stakeholders. They all tell me the same thing: professionals across the EU are waiting for us to deliver on our promise to enhance mobility. They are providing essential services across the EU, helping to drive our economy and enhancing our citizens’ quality of life. They are keen to help deliver for the single market. We need to provide a framework that enables them to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">In drafting my report, I took into consideration their views and came up with four areas where improvements in the directive could be made. In the first place, we need to simplify information and procedures for citizens and professionals. Competent authorities, professional bodies and Member States need to provide clear, concise and centralised information to professionals. That is why I have asked the Commission to establish an on-line portal that clearly provides all the necessary information and signpost professionals to the relevant authorities in the host Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a number of the provisions currently used in the directive require immediate updating. Critically, we also need to update the way in which professions are regulated across the EU. I firmly believe that the most effective way to enable the free movement of workers would be to reduce the number of regulated professions in Europe, whilst maintaining the necessary safeguards and caveats for those professions with health and safety implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the protection of public health and safety is a vital aspect of this directive. Continuous professional development is absolutely crucial in maintaining professional standards, especially in the health care sector. On the controversial issue of languages, I have asked that the Commission clarify the provisions in the directive so as to allow competent authorities flexibility in assessing language skills during the recognition process. Most importantly, I have asked the Commission to implement a proactive alert mechanism contained within the internal market information system that will trigger an alert to all Member States when regulatory action has been taken against a professional’s rights to provide services, whilst respecting personal data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a major problem described by many professionals in the public consultation is quite simply a lack of trust in the current system. I therefore asked the Commission to introduce an obligation that competent authorities proactively share information over the IMI system to inject this confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come to the issue of the professional card. It is clear that whilst it may be valuable to some professions, concerns raised in the pilot projects reveal that the concept still needs to be refined. That is why I am very clear in my belief that any card must be voluntary, and that a thorough impact assessment is absolutely crucial to determine whether or not the professional card will be a useful initiative. Sadly, a number of my colleagues did not share my view and instead voted in committee to push the card through without an impact assessment. However, in my report, we have called on the Commission to provide evidence of added value of the card before it is introduced, and I hope that they will do just that.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />There are other areas where I would have preferred a different outcome and which I hope we can improve on with the legislative proposal. Nonetheless, the report as a whole provides an excellent indication to the Commission on Parliament’s position. On a number of issues, we are very clear: we need to make information on recognition easier to understand and access; we need to update those existing provisions that are out of date, and we need Member States to reconsider the justifications for regulating certain professions. We must maintain and build up the protections granted to the public and patients by establishing an alert mechanism. Finally, we must inject confidence into the system, utilising IMI, ensuring proper transposition by Member States, and investigating the potential value of a professional card.</p>
<p class="contents">To finish, I would like to thank the Commission, especially Jürgen Tiedje, and, once gain, the shadows and advisers, for working so hard on this dossier. I look forward to working closely with all of you again when the legislative proposal is released later this year; thank you for helping to make my first report such a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you for giving me the floor in order to raise an extremely important issue at a time when our discussions are centred on our citizens, the single market, and the human dimension of that single market, which we wish to enhance. Recognition of professional qualifications is of vital interest to our citizens. Twenty-eight per cent of them today envisage working in another country at some point in their career.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 2007 and 2010, the automatic recognition of professional qualifications allowed more than 100 000 Europeans to make that personal goal a reality. We believe this mechanism has even greater potential. Today, it applies to some 6.4 million professionals, of whom 5.7 million are health professionals, 160 000 are veterinary surgeons, and more than 435 000 are architects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these sorts of figures clearly show what free movement of professionals could mean for the internal market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to, and should, facilitate that recognition, making it simpler and faster. The recognition of qualifications is a vehicle for greater trust, and goodness knows we need our citizens and businesses to trust more in the European project right now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to follow these general remarks by saying how happy I am that the own-initiative report you have just presented, Ms McClarkin, shows real convergence with many of the ideas proposed in the Commission Green Paper published last June. This confirms once again the strong cooperation between our two institutions, which I value greatly. I also witnessed the quality and sincerity of our relationship at the public conference organised by the Commission on 7 November in Brussels, at which many of you were present, particularly the Chair, Mr Harbour, as well as Ms Turunen, Ms Vergnaud and Ms Le Grip, who were all keen to speak in the panel discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to thank you, Ms McClarkin, and the Chair, Mr Harbour, and to welcome the work carried out by the other Members of the European Parliament who, as part of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, contributed to the discussion you have presented in a highly constructive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to state that, as far as I am concerned, the report you have just presented provides clarification and makes a very significant contribution right at a time when we are putting the finishing touches to the legislative proposal that will be presented by the Commission on 20 December. Our positions are not always identical but, apart from a few subtle differences, there are no major differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to emphasise four important points. First of all, the professional card. The main aim of modernising the directive is to promote mobility by simplifying the procedures involved in the mutual recognition of qualifications, and by making them more efficient. As I have already said, that is why we are considering creating this European professional card, which should be simple, practical and specific. It is not a traditional smart card, which could prove very expensive and, in any case, difficult to bring out at a reasonable cost. The card we are proposing would be more like an electronic certificate based on an information exchange between the competent authorities. This card would be optional for professionals but compulsory for the competent authorities, and could reduce the time required to process a recognition request from several months to a few weeks. Of course, the Member States of origin would need to be much more involved, and, as was said earlier, the internal market information system (IMI) would have to be used in order to help reduce costs for all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the number of regulated professions. I am aware – and you also mentioned it a moment ago, Ms McClarkin – of the debate on the number of regulated professions, which some consider too high. On this sensitive issue, I would like to put things in context. Of the 800 categories of regulated professions, 43% are health professionals, and 9% work in education or are professionals from the social sector. If I may give my opinion objectively, I do not think it is unreasonable that, given the sensitive nature of these sectors, the professions included within those sectors should be regulated. I therefore believe that we should first look at what exactly is being regulated and why. I have not excluded the idea of initially applying a compulsory, enhanced transparency measure for Member States. It is up to those Member States to endeavour to make a critical analysis of the number and type of regulated professions. The other day, I attended the Competitiveness Council, where one of the ministers around the table, the Portuguese minister, explained that Portugal had taken the decision to eliminate around 15 regulations that were considered unnecessary. However, while we are waiting for Member States to take the steps we have encouraged, we shall propose solutions such as partial access, which could reduce the difficulties experienced by some professionals in terms of mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns preserving automatic recognition. Automatic recognition is a system that currently promotes mobility. It is an <span class="italic">acquis</span> that we want to maintain. I am very pleased that Parliament supports this view. Nevertheless, I shall propose to modernise the system and go even further by extending it to other professions, particularly through common frameworks for training, which could be useful in replacing the previous concept of common platforms. We need to modernise, certainly, but without undermining automatic recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with that in mind, Ms McClarkin, that you just mentioned the issue of language requirements for health professionals, which should be approached with a certain amount of caution. The problem is not the directive itself. I believe this directive establishes an obligation for professionals to have a knowledge of the language of the host country, which is clearly needed if they are to properly exercise their profession. We believe that the problem stems from the implementation of this obligation for health professionals in Member States. I have two comments to make on this point. Firstly, as far as salaried professionals are concerned, I would highlight the role of employers, who should verify their employees’ language skills, and also I would point out that the best solution we have on this matter is severing the links between language skills testing and recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a fourth and final point to make: points of single contact (PSCs). For businesses and self-employed professionals, the Services Directive was a major step forward. I would also like to say that, in my visits to the Member States and my dealings with national governments, I endeavour each week to check for proper transposition and, above all, implementation of the Services Directive, which has more potential than is currently being exploited. The Services Directive represented real progress, with the establishment of PSCs in order to obtain information and complete administrative procedures electronically. Salaried workers and health professionals should benefit from those same advantages. We should therefore establish an online central information point, as you have suggested yourself, based on those PSCs, enabling professionals to carry out the recognition procedure online.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the four points I wanted to mention, and may I sincerely thank you once again, Ms McClarkin, for the quality of your report, which is going to be of great use to me and my services in the coming days, before we put forward the legislative proposal on 20 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is the fact that the mutual recognition of professional qualifications promotes the free movement of people and employees, and their application in the labour markets of the EU’s Member States undoubtedly contributes to increasing employment and also to the mobility of the workforce. The legislation applied in this field no doubt needs to be reviewed, focusing, in particular, on simplifying administrative procedures and on the speedier recognition of qualifications, a reduction in the number of regulated professions and, hopefully, the better coordination of professional training. As for the professional card, which we understand rather as a specific database or electronic database, we can see two aspects of this issue. The first one would be a database of persons with a certain level of qualification and who wish to be included in such a database in order to ensure easy recognition of their qualifications in other countries; this database must be voluntary and could be organised on a national level. In contrast to this is a database of persons who, for some reason, have been prohibited from carrying out their profession. Such a database must be mandatory and uniform across the whole Community. Finally, I would like to emphasise that the European Union is not competent to make decisions on the subject of professional qualifications; it can only make proposals to Member States and create an infrastructure for the mutual recognition of qualifications between the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is estimated that there is a need for around a million health care professionals in Europe. This means that we need a quick and efficient system for recognising qualifications, and the professional card could facilitate this process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the health care sector, mobility must be combined with safeguarding and ensuring patient safety. This is the direction taken by the report voted for by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for which I was rapporteur. Mobility and patient protection must be considered two sides of the same coin. Therefore, extension of the rapid reaction mechanism to the health care professions is not only commendable, but also necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has expressed its support for Ms McClarkin’s report; we have made a significant contribution to drawing up the report and, of course, we support its main recommendations for greater professional mobility, and greater simplicity and efficiency in the procedures for recognising professional qualifications while protecting consumer and patient safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the issue of increased professional mobility is being discussed mostly in terms of promoting growth. What is more, the Single Market Forum held in Kraków at the beginning of October was absolutely right on this. It reminded us that Member States should recognise the internal market’s potential to boost growth and job creation, and should act in order to remove all barriers to the completion of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council meeting of 23 October also established as one of its main priorities, in order to achieve – and I quote – smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the implementation of the 12 levers of the Single Market Act, which are 12 proposals put forward by the Commission, one of which is the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to us that by increasing professional mobility, we can expect to unlock the growth potential of the internal market – our internal market – of 500 million citizens, of 500 million consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional mobility should therefore enable us not only to guarantee the free movement – if enhanced, modernised and improved – of our compatriots within this market, but also, we hope, to achieve higher growth rates. That is why we in the PPE Group – may I stress the idea of a practical recommendation – have given exceptional support to the establishment of a voluntary professional card. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It relates to one of the fundamental rights of the EU: freedom of movement and of establishment. However, it remains limited because we are still lacking simple, clear rules for the recognition of professional qualifications. Repeated tidying-up of legislation does not hide the anachronism of some mechanisms that date back to a time when cross-border mobility was still anecdotal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that today, 50% of young Europeans are willing to go and work in another Member State, and the new directive will need to take up that challenge. This is a major project. The lack of basic harmonisation of training, the high number of regulated professions and the complexity of the recognition process create legal uncertainty, so much so that this issue accounts for 16% of the complaints made to the SOLVIT network.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim is to simplify procedures for citizens, guarantee transparent decision making and reduce delays through better cooperation between competent authorities and between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The classification of economic activities should also be reviewed, because professions and related training requirements are constantly evolving. I welcome the fact that the report focuses on the specificities of the health care professions, due to the implications in terms of patient safety, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I clearly support the creation of a voluntary European professional card system. This type of card should, in particular, facilitate the steps involved and improve consumer and patient safety. Beyond that, this card will help to build a European identity and show that the single market is not only about movement of goods and people, but that it can and should be the basis for economic wealth and shared citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate Ms McClarkin on this good report, which, I hope, will be widely adopted tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to put forward five main points from the Group of the Greens that we consider to be particularly important in this report. First of all, we believe that more flexible frameworks and quicker procedures must not result in a reduction in professional skills. Secondly, the health and safety of patients and consumers must be paramount. Thirdly, further automation and harmonisation must be carried out on the basis of the wishes of the industry and professions, based on their voluntary cooperation. Fourthly, we are very much in favour of a professional card, that is to say, a form of e-card scheme which can be continually updated and which is based on the system that is already in operation, namely, the Internal Market Information system (IMI). Fifthly, we believe it is very important to focus on continued professional development and upskilling. That is something to which we in the Group of the Greens attach a great deal of importance, so I would like to thank the rapporteur, and we look forward to working on the legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that this group in particular is deeply engaged with issues that we want to move forward on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This report represents more than two years of work by members of my committee. Ms McClarkin has pulled together many of the issues that we have worked on in two public hearings, in an interparliamentary meeting, and indeed in one-to-one meetings with parliamentarians in different countries. It is an indication of how this Parliament should be working.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to get a proposal from the Commissioner – and I welcome him very much here today and thank him for that work – but we want to feed into that, as he said, before he puts that piece of work together. We are talking about issues like smarter and better regulation in this Parliament. This is the way that committees need to be engaged in that. This is a great example. I want to thank all my colleagues for working on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say as far as the single market is concerned, that the single market is not a bloodless bureaucratic creation. It is built on the skills and talent of millions of people, and people have an entitlement under the single market rules to have their qualifications speedily and effectively recognised. We are not delivering that entitlement properly, but hopefully, as of next year, we will be able to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When leaving the economic and financial crisis behind us, we should particularly encourage the mobility of EU citizens so that we will be able to respond more quickly and effectively to the needs of labour markets in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that freedom of movement and the right to take up work in other Member States has long been a core value of the EU, citizens still face many barriers and obstacles resulting from different conditions and national legislative solutions. At present, only 2% of EU citizens work in a Member State other than that of which they are nationals. However, some 20% express a willingness to take up work in another country, which shows that we are dealing with an untapped potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications still form an example of barriers to the freedom to take up work in another EU country. In this situation, a full revision of the current directive is required, but also the proper and rapid implementation of new rules in the Member States. New rules should be based on simplified procedures, good information, reducing the number of regulated professions and the introduction of a more automatic recognition of professional qualifications. Only in this way will we incite citizens to greater mobility and guarantee the fundamental right to take up work freely elsewhere in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of recognition of professional qualifications is only one of the elements of a long-term and comprehensive strategy on mobility, which Europe needs in order to ensure sustainable growth. Eliminating all existing legal and administrative obstacles to the free movement of workers should be a priority for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are still far too many problems and obstacles raised by the Member States, as well as difficulties posed by European law, and it is important that we should tackle this issue.

Those who favour such a move still have not indicated which professions they would like to see deregulated. I would like to know: are they talking about doctors, engineers or architects? I am not sure. What I am sure about is that regulation is extremely important and necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the professional card: this is something that would allow our citizens genuine freedom of movement, which is why we should not spend too much time on analysis, but instead should respond to the need expressed by those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Engineers and doctors were the first to say that they needed something like this to be able to move more freely around Europe, which is, after all, a political union.

Today, Europe is on the brink of stagnation at the very least, if not a recession. Coming through such a period will be extremely difficult. Today, the Union and its institutions suffer from a lack of legitimacy and the faith of its citizens in its future is rapidly draining away. The solution for the current situation is definitely not a further strengthening of the Union and the transfer of further powers to Brussels, but a return to the original concepts of European integration, and a re-launch of the internal market and the Single Market Act. Increasing the mobility of a qualified workforce and reducing the number of regulated professions is an effective solution to the current economic problems of certain Member States. For this reason, I would like to call on Member States not to be swayed by the populist lure of protectionist measures for national labour markets, but, quite the opposite, to remove existing barriers more speedily and, instead of creating national preference measures, to focus on reinforcing their own strengths in a competitive and functioning internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Given the increasing numbers of skilled young graduates who find themselves without employment, it is essential that the EU puts in place a system that allows our graduates to move and secure employment across the 27 Member States with ease. Studies show that 50% of young Europeans wish to work abroad but are hindered in doing so by a cumbersome process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the current system of recognising professional qualifications earned in another Member State is time consuming, complex and not employer-friendly. The harmonisation of rules concerning the exchange of information for each individual profession would be a welcome step, along with creating database systems and information-sharing processes that will assist graduates in their mobility across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I wish to draw Parliament’s and the Commission’s attention to the problems that graduates are dealing with in terms of the grey area around professional qualifications. By this, I mean compulsory probationary periods that are not being recognised across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I personally know of a young qualified teacher who has been awarded the academic qualification for teaching but cannot take up work as a teacher as the probationary training undertaken in the UK is not recognised in Ireland. However, her counterparts have no problem qualifying in the UK and completing their probationary training in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">This administrative contradiction is placing many teaching graduates in limbo. Their professional qualifications are recognised, but they still cannot take up employment as they cannot get registered.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of equivalence of standards here is causing real problems for graduates and requires immediate action from the Member States and the Commission in order to stop them being penalised for being mobile and taking up training opportunities in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Graduates should not be left in limbo, and measures need to be implemented without delay to ensure that they have access to a truly internal market and that the Professional Qualifications Directive is broad enough to cover all aspects of qualification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recognition of professional qualifications – either for further education or for finding a job on the labour market beyond the borders of one’s home land – is certainly a priority in this context. We have to enable professionals to look for work, wherever in the Union that work may be.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the implementation of this directive in practice has shown where this situation is more complex and where the problems of recognising qualifications and diplomas persist. And, of course, this has to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, as a member of the Committee on Education, which has handled this issue many times within the framework of the agenda for the policy on youth education, I welcome the initiative of the European Commission to modernise this directive and I would certainly like to express my thanks to our rapporteur for the high-quality report which precisely identifies the problems in recognising qualifications in everyday life and, of course, pays sufficient attention to problematic professions and proposes specific solutions.</p>

For generations, the UK has welcomed and valued doctors from many countries. However, the directive is not as successful as the Commissioner would like us to believe.

<p class="contents">A tragedy like this undermines confidence in the very many thousands of excellent doctors from many different countries we have working in our country and across the EU. All doctors need to prove to the national regulator that they have not only academic qualifications but also have language and communications skills, as well as familiarity with local practices, and the EU directive must be amended to allow this.</p>

As a corollary, failure to recognise professional qualifications is often a strategic decision, namely a move to keep wages as low as possible, drawing a veil over the applicability of collective wage agreements in order to cover up the principle that the same wage should or must be paid for the same work at the same location.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from the eastern part of Austria. A large number of cross-border commuters from Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic work there, many of them finding that their often excellent qualifications are not recognised. This results in a ‘lose-lose’ situation for all workers, namely, for those who come to Austria with excellent skills, but whose qualifications are not recognised, and, on the other hand, for Austrian workers, who naturally find themselves under corresponding pressure. This means that the principles that the report now pursues – transparency, simplified recognition processes and a voluntary professional card – are a positive development in the final analysis. I hope that the Commissioner will take up these proposals in order to take control of the problems I have described. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be made easier for people to find out which authority is responsible for recognising a particular professional qualification. We need a faster, simpler recognition procedure. We cannot have a situation where an applicant has to wait several months for his professional qualifications to be recognised. It is only right that the candidate’s knowledge of the language in which he or she is to work should be tested. This is particularly important in the health sector and the associated caring professions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same standards for job descriptions will certainly simplify mutual recognition. A voluntary professional card and skills passport can be useful in this regard. They also provide information about the skills learned. This type of documentation can also indicate which skills a candidate still lacks. Clearly defined follow-up checks should be possible to ensure that standards are maintained and that a professional qualification can be recognised in another Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 2007, some 100 000 decisions have been made on recognition under the directive, making mobility possible for 85 000 professionals. However, more than 16% of SOLVIT cases in 2010 related to recognition of professional qualifications. Labour market developments require greater transparency, simplification and flexibility of the rules on the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular updating of the requirements for initial training, recognition of experience and continuous professional development are essential to the harmonisation of training. The right to obtain employment or provide services in another Member State is a fundamental right under the Treaties and constitutes a concrete example of how citizens can benefit from the single market.

<p class="contents">It is precisely because we are thinking in terms of the Single Market Act – which is an agenda for renewed growth – and because mobility is one of the tools for the new growth our citizens need, that we are addressing the issue of professional qualifications today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to thank you, and then speak about the professional card, which many of you have mentioned and which is a tool I very much believe in. Indeed, in the first few days after I was appointed, many of you drew my attention to this option. A voluntary card for professionals, and a compulsory card for the national authorities: if we succeed, this will certainly result in simplification, as Ms Vergnaud called it, in a shorter time frame and, above all, in the right to more efficient and faster processing for professionals thanks to the expertise of the internal market information system (IMI). I would say to Ms Regner and Ms Klass, who mentioned objectivity and transparency, that through this system, we will be able, I believe, to achieve greater efficiency, speed and also transparency and objectivity as regards professionals’ real qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Pirillo that it will also mean that health professionals become mobile more quickly, while the right to safety for patients and those who call on health professionals will be protected. Ms Turunen also mentioned this issue of citizens’ right to safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Aylward mentioned continuous training. Indeed, we are going to suggest that Member States should have to at least provide an update on what they are doing in the area of continuous training.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Obermayr brought up an important point when he talked about the brain drain. I think that, in countries that are having more trouble than others, mobility could be problematic, and that is why, Mr Obermayr, we need to establish a framework for cooperation and a context for this issue of mobility and the recognition of professional qualifications. May I say that I believe we need more Europe rather than less Europe on this matter. That is my conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Batten, to whom I would say that this is not an ideological document, mentioned – as did Ms Ford – an unusual case involving a ban, with which we are all familiar. Without going into detail, I would just like to point out that the directive contains very clear rules on language skills, particularly for doctors, and Member States must therefore be objective and rigorous in using the tools made available by this directive in order to implement measures and verify people’s skills and ability, even if, in this specific case involving a ban, there was no clear link between the problem that arose and the testing of language knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I would like to say to Ms Vergnaud, who said that mobility is not anecdotal, and to Mr Harbour, that, indeed, it is not anecdotal. It is a major issue within the single market, which is our shared space for economic and social coexistence, and I believe that by establishing a solid framework and proper verification, by facilitating the full recognition of qualifications with the tools we have discussed, and by making use of the Internet, we will achieve higher growth levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Ms Gebhardt, Mr Harbour, Ms McClarkin herself, Mr Kožušník and Ms Irigoyen Pérez raised the issue of regulated professions and the number thereof, as well as the problem of potentially reducing those professions. I would like to restate my conviction. The issue is not whether the number of regulated professions is too high or not high enough, but whether or not regulation, in countries with very numerous or very strict regulations for these professions, constitutes a barrier that is disproportionate to the correct functioning of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I plan to bring greater transparency to this debate by asking all Member States to notify all the professions they regulate and to submit to an objective assessment of the reasons why they believe this type of regulation to be necessary and proportionate. After receiving their responses, we will carry out a benchmarking process to compare all the results of this exercise. I believe the Professional Qualifications Directive already guarantees professional mobility between Member States that regulate and those that do not regulate a specific profession. It provides solutions to ensure the equivalence of qualifications, which is a proposal we shall table on the basis of the clarification provided by your report.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Ms McClarkin, by sincerely thanking you and all those who worked with you, and by reiterating the importance of the report you have presented today. It will make a useful contribution to the Commission’s legislative proposal of 20 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also urgently need to establish a proper system in the European Union for the validation of professional skills so that highly skilled workers and trained professionals are not forced to do unskilled work because otherwise, such workers lose their skills, experience and qualifications in the long term. I would like to draw attention to the fact that dialogue and exchanges of information within each individual profession must be enhanced and that cooperation between the competent authorities and national contact points (NCPs) must be improved, at both national and Community level. The European Commission should support networks of competent authorities and professional bodies for the most mobile professions for the purposes of exchanging general information about national processes and education requirements, sharing best practice and investigating possibilities for deeper cooperation, such as common platforms. In turn, the Member States should improve the efficiency of public authorities in providing information both about workers’ rights and about procedures for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to guarantee workers’ rights and stop the exploitation of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An effort must be made to simplify procedures, in particular, as regards the general system of recognition. I also consider it appropriate to evaluate the implementation and relevance of compensation measures and to adopt optional guidelines for a more uniform approach to the implementation of such measures. Temporary mobility must be supported by clarifying the concept and abolishing the system of prior declaration in cases where service providers accompany a consumer to another Member State without having any contact with local consumers. We could also explore the possibility of coordinating our education systems with a view to achieving a higher degree of harmonisation in the future and being able to extend the system of automatic recognition to other professions as well. Last but not least, voluntary professional cards may be an effective instrument for speeding up the recognition of qualifications but should be introduced only where they add real value to the current system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom of movement is one of the essential rights of membership of the Union, and changing demographics will make the mobility across the European Union increasingly important. At present, only a few professions are regulated at Community level, while the rest are subject to costly and lengthy equivalence procedures, ranging from testing to the requirement of further studies. Bearing in mind that educational reforms are facilitating the process of recognising qualifications at European level through the European Qualifications Framework and the Bologna process, I believe that the list of professions regulated at EU level should be extended. The procedures for recognising diplomas and professional qualifications should also be simplified and accelerated, and this process should be made more transparent. In this context, we should also deal with the problem of the recognition of qualifications of third-country nationals, who should not take priority over citizens of the Member States. I also believe that states should accept all categories of workers on the labour market and not just those who are highly qualified, which leads to the phenomenon of the so-called brain drain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, above all, an economic necessity which should be implemented as soon as possible given that, by the end of 2020, we will need up to 16 million highly qualified professionals. In order for the mobility of these workers to lead to genuine economic recovery, we must make it easier for them to take up work and set up business in the country of their choice where there is indeed a need for their knowledge and skills. To this end, national laws that create unnecessary barriers and difficulties must be revised. It is my conviction that harmonisation of rules in the field of vocational training at European level could be a good solution, although I realise that this would be complicated. Also not without significance is easy access to relevant information for those interested. I therefore urge the European Commission to consolidate sources of information already available so that people wishing to take up an activity in a country other than their country of origin have access in their own language to the necessary documents and information on the appropriate branch organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Member States have not yet implemented the directive and there are still far too many problems with recognition. This is also evident in the document from the Commission on which this own-initiative report is based. I welcome this report whole heartedly because it paves the way for the position the European Parliament is to adopt in relation to the promised revised directive at the beginning of next year. From an employment policy perspective, I would once again emphasise that we need to put an end quickly to the sometimes unfair practices found in the Member States. We cannot have a situation where, in many cases, qualifications are not recognised in order to keep wage costs low. This is clearly a problem of misalignment and is causing difficulties for immigrant job-seekers. This not only constitutes an infringement of the principle of equality, but also significantly restricts mobility within the workforce. The European Parliament needs to take a clear line on this in the forthcoming revision of the directive. I look forward to continued excellent cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title18"></a><a name="creitem18"></a>

The issue I am referring to is that of Romania and the restitution of property nationalised under the Communist dictatorship. In the case of one property already restored to its former owners – a property incidentally belonging to a minority church – a trial is currently under way in Romania in which the accused are none other than the former members of the national restitution committee, Secretary of State Mr Attila Markó and his colleagues, who approved the restitution of this property a few years ago in accordance with the legislation then in force and in line with their official duties. The outcome of this court case could affect the entire restitution process in Romania, as it may call into question the restoration of church property to its rightful owners. I ask the European Parliament and you, Madam President, to follow developments in this case closely, as the European Union expects every Member State to abide by the rule of law. The next hearing in this trial is due to take place tomorrow. The only way this trial can end fairly is if these unfounded charges are dropped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The referendum was cancelled following severe political reaction in Greece and in order to save Greece’s European prospects.

What is more, that response ought to be echoed here in this Parliament, since it is this Parliament that underwrites many of the measures which this aggressive agenda entails.</p>
<p class="contents">The general strike planned for 24 November will be a high point in this struggle, a culmination of the various demonstrations, protests and sector-wide stoppages of these past days. On Saturday, more than 180 000 public service workers took to the streets of Lisbon. In the fields of education, health care, transport, public security and defence, and out in the countryside too, workers, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and ordinary people swelled an enormous tide of protest against generalised impoverishment, against robbery from workers and pensioners, and against the plundering of national resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The general strike on the 24th will not mark an end to this struggle, but will move it to a higher level, since it is also a struggle in defence of democracy: democracy which is gravely mutilated and deformed when a people is deprived of the basic means for deciding its own fate and determining its collective future, as is happening under the iniquitous privatisation programme constituted by this troika’s aggression pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2008, the European Parliament awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize for the first time, and that year it was won by a Hungarian foundation, the Rákóczi Foundation, which began its activities back in the early 90s, inviting young people from Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania and Serbia for around three weeks to learn about Hungary, about history, and about human rights. And these three weeks are not just a one-off meeting for these young people; the friendships they develop often lead to spontaneous get-togethers over the years afterwards. This year, they demonstrated that they know what European thinking is about: this year, the European Year of Volunteering, more than one hundred young people travelled to a small Serbian village and set about renovating the village playing fields, painting the seating and the fences. My view is: you can say nice words about the idea of Europe, and you can take action. These youngsters have set us an example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They want to set a very stringent ceiling on public aid, that is to say, government aid, for example, for B’Tselem and other human rights organisations. They will be allowed to receive a maximum of ILS 20 000, the equivalent of just a few thousand euro, a year. That is tantamount to stopping them completely.</p>

Israel is merely continuing because it is not encountering any real opposition. I would therefore very strongly urge the Council and the Commission to consider whether we should not now start to look at the privileged partnerships between Israel and the EU. It cannot be right for us to accept the destruction of the freedom of expression in this way in Israel – and certainly not from those who have been our best partners for a long time. We need to do more than simply get angry and say ‘Shame on you!’ and ‘You must not do that!’ This is a disaster, and not only for the freedom of expression and democracy, but, in reality, for Israel’s future as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Internet has been shown to have greatly multiplied the opportunities and risks of cyber espionage aimed at achieving an economic or political advantage, an activity which is increasingly gaining ground compared to traditional intelligence gathering. The sad fact is that Europe is lagging years behind the USA, China and Russia in terms of cyber security, whereas, for example, Russian intelligence possesses a highly sophisticated set of cyber tools. It would be important, therefore, to assess and define more clearly in the EU Internal Security Strategy than has been the case up to now what defence capabilities we possess against attacks of this sort.

After years of difficult transition, the country’s fragile democracy is again at stake. Vote buying, vote control by the government, police methods, political pressure, the use of criminal elements to cause intimidation and ballot paper abuses – all of this became the hallmark of the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">There was unprecedented interference by the executive power. The interior minister took charge of the ruling party’s political headquarters. Almost half a million Bulgarian citizens were included in ‘banned lists’, depriving them of the right to vote. One of the greatest achievements of democracy has been violated – the right to free elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections are now being disputed by all the parties. For the first time since democratic changes have occurred in Bulgaria, the opposition wants the presidential elections to be annulled. The overwhelming view is that it won the elections, but lost the count.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, President Barroso called for a deepening of democracy as a guarantee of the European Union’s proper integration. If we do not halt the war on democracy today, xenophobia, populism and the violation of human rights will gain more, new ground tomorrow.</p>

On that basis, the European Parliament undertook to draft an own-initiative report in order to put its mark on the new act. The draft report was initially undertaken by Eva-Britt Svensson on behalf of my political group; however, she was forced to abandon it when she resigned due to health reasons and I was appointed to complete it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my warmest thanks to Eva-Britt for the work which she managed to do on this report and I wish her a speedy recovery. Both Ms Svensson and I wished to identify the weaknesses and omissions in the system and to include provisions to empower consumers. The basic objectives of the draft report, as formulated in the proposed preliminary draft, were to highlight the problems faced by citizens/consumers, to eliminate inequalities between consumers and in their relations with companies, to safeguard consumer rights in general, with specific emphasis on e-commerce, to establish an effective alternative dispute resolution system, better product safety and a high level of consumer protection, to focus on vulnerable groups of the population in a bid to achieve a more socially fair Europe, to ensure consumers have better access to social welfare services, ecology and sustainability, to reduce the exposure of consumers to dangerous chemicals, such as antibiotics in the meat industry and parabens in cosmetics, to reduce artificial transfats in foods, and to protect children from advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the political groups took differing approaches to the above objectives and tabled a total of 188 amendments in order to put forward their solutions to the various issues. In a bid to include as many views as possible in the report without altering its fundamental nature, we formulated 16 compromise amendments with the help of the shadow rapporteurs and the report, as it now stands, was ultimately put to the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on 17 October 2011, when it was adopted by 23 votes to zero, with 10 abstentions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the draft, as adopted, did not satisfy all sides in Parliament: that was because, although the report was a report on consumer policy strategy, it was adopted without any reference to the objective of a more socially fair Europe; at the same time, almost all the references to dangerous carcinogenic chemicals had been deleted, as had the position that direct television advertising targeting children under 12 should be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this development and following agreement with all the political groups, we opened a new round of discussions, which ultimately resulted in a commitment on all sides to support the compromise text proposed for adoption tomorrow, which highlights the problems faced by consumers, who have been rendered more vulnerable by the economic crisis, seeks greater product safety, emphasises the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, seeks a higher level of consumer protection and environmental protection, expresses concern at the extensive advertising to which children are exposed and recommends ways of combating food waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the spirit of collaboration that they demonstrated and for their very important contributions to the final text, in which agreement was reached on the basic aspects of the report, and for all undertaking to vote in favour of it in tomorrow’s vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Guaranteeing the free movement of goods, services and capital must genuinely serve the needs of EU citizens. I would like to point out that although there has been a clear change in terms of consumer awareness and familiarity with consumer rights, Europe is still divided as regards this sensitive issue. We must put our full weight behind the Commission’s efforts to ensure that from 2012 onwards, there will be clear changes in consumer protection both within Member States and in cross-border matters. We must reinforce information networks and place greater emphasis on the provision of information and resources for consumer protection campaigns, consumer protection surveys and product testing. Identifying individual anomalies and violations of the law is straightforward if those affected have appropriate instruments at their disposal. I would just like to mention the product test carried out in the spring which showed that in Slovakia, some manufacturers do not think very highly of buyers in Central European markets. I hope that the Commission’s new initiative will bring about transparency in consumer protection legislation and improve its implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that, in this report, we deal with many groups of citizens and their protection, I do not detect any focus on or more attention being paid to the rights of young people as consumers. Young people are becoming consumers at a lower and lower age and, at the same time, they are the most innovative group of consumers. They are open to new things, such as purchasing through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is really important to educate these consumers and, for example, the introduction of compulsory education on consumer rights into the curriculum of elementary schools across the whole European Union can surely help in educating a new generation, which will be more responsible and aware of its rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we should not forget other generations either, and we should continue to inform people and educate them about consumer rights in general. Only this way can we improve the whole situation in the field of consumer rights, otherwise we will have 800 directives in vain if people do not know how to utilise them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A coherent legal framework is needed at European level to ensure adequate protection for all citizens. Combating misleading advertising is an important aspect of this process. I would point out that the National Authority for Consumer Protection (ANPC) in Romania has initiated draft amending legislation in this area with a view to better protecting consumer interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Information and education activities are also needed. For example, a national competition entitled ‘Choose – it’s your right’, organised by the ANPC and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, is held each year in Romania with a view to educating young consumers. This competition, now being held for the ninth time, is aimed at school pupils between the ages of 6 and 18 and seeks to create a generation of consumers who are aware of their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am still astonished at how indifferent our attitude here in Parliament is towards ordinary people, and especially consumers in more vulnerable positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in our fine speeches, we claim that consumers are at the heart of the single market, but, in reality, we tend to give more importance to market forces and economic growth. Consumer protection and increased levels of safety are the EU’s ambitious goals. Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and children, need protection in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the report is calling for a ban on misleading advertising targeted at children. Advertising aimed at children also affects their relationships with their friends and their social status. Clothes, toys and electronic goods, for example, very quickly show whether a family has money or not. Surely none of us here want exclusion among Europeans to start in the nursery. For this reason, I hope that we can also genuinely convey to companies the notion of the sort of more solidary Europe that we want to take forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Making consumers aware of their responsibilities, providing them with better information, ensuring the safety of the products available to them, quickly implementing existing EU legislation and ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of their rights and responsibilities: those should be the priorities for national and European legislators, for national and European decision makers, and also for companies, professional organisations and consumer associations.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I believe that this is the right stage at which to begin proper, detailed discussions, so as to strike the correct balance between the amount and depth of information that consumers really need, the way in which they will use that information when making purchases, and the administrative and financial costs for companies of publishing it.</p>
<p class="contents">The key word is therefore ‘responsibility’: responsibility on the part of producers, entrepreneurs, businesses and service providers, as well as on the part of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I realise that a report is, in essence, a series of compromises and might not address, or not address fully, all the issues some of you consider most important.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I must say that the final outcome of your work provides excellent input into the Commission’s work on consumer policy. It contains very substantial elements for the promotion of the interests of European consumers. In particular, I very much welcome the comprehensive approach to consumer policy embodied in the report. Indeed, a successful modern consumer policy cannot be only about legislation, but has to be multi-faceted.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the report rightly puts the emphasis on consumer safety, both for products and food. It stresses the importance of empowering consumers, of consumer education and information. It rightly emphasises the need for EU consumer policy to support growth and innovation in the retail sector and, in particular, the completion of the digital single market. It cites reviewing the existing consumer legislation, notably in relation to unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising, and redress – including alternative dispute resolution and on-line dispute resolution – among the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It insists on the need to ensure effective implementation and enforcement of existing legislation. It highlights some cross-cutting issues such as sustainable consumption, vulnerable consumers and accessibility. From a sectoral point of view, it rightly puts the stress on financial services, energy and digital.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with previous Parliament reports dealing with consumer issues – such as the Grech, Hedh, Arias and Schaldemose reports, as well as the forthcoming work on vulnerable consumers – this report offers the Commission an extremely valuable source of inspiration for its work on the future consumer policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about the Commission’s intentions in this respect. Vice-President Reding and I envisage presenting a Consumer Agenda in the first half of next year. This Consumer Agenda will present a coherent, strategic vision for consumer policy in the years to come, together with milestones set between 2012 and the end of the current Commission’s mandate. We envisage an ambitious text, focusing on concrete measures, putting consumers at the centre of the single market, something you have stressed in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">The key principle will be to empower consumers, in the broadest sense of the term. Empowerment is about how consumers can participate actively in the market and make it work for them. We will include consumer issues under Vice-President Reding’s portfolio and my own, but also measures falling under other Commissioners’ responsibility, such as financial services, energy, transport and digital.</p>
<p class="contents">This will meet a key concern mentioned in your report, namely, the need for a coherent, holistic approach to consumer policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Consumer Agenda will also need to take into account the emerging challenges facing future consumer policy: the need to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption; to address the specific needs of an ageing population; digitalisation (including e-commerce); and the issue of social inclusion and vulnerable consumers. Again, this is fully in line with your report.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Consumer Agenda will also have the explicit ambition to build on the progress already made in realising a European Judicial Area, thus enhancing the role that judges, legal practitioners and enforcement authorities can play, including across borders. To this end, the Consumer Agenda shall be built on partnerships, both in order to pull resources together, in line with the principle of ‘doing more with less’, and bringing on board all relevant actors. This includes partnerships with Member States on enforcement and information, with intermediaries (consumer organisations and the media), with business on consumer information, and at international level on product safety. We have already collected contributions from the advisory networks that we manage which bring together consumer organisations and national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We now plan to organise a hearing at the beginning of 2012, possibly with the help of the IMCO Committee. Discussions are ongoing as regards its organisation. As a first step, we are preparing, in response to an earlier request from Parliament, a report on the integration of consumer interests into all aspects of consumer policy. This should be ready in early 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that last week, the Commission adopted a proposal for the 2014-2020 consumer programme – the financial framework that will underpin the Consumer Agenda from 2014 onwards. This is now for discussion between the budgetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed consumer programme focuses on four key areas of action, covering the whole spectrum of consumer policy. I am particularly pleased to note that its four specific objectives are very much in tune with the recommendations of your report: consumer safety (products, food and services); providing consumers with the right information and the educational tools to properly understand it; consolidating and further strengthening consumer rights and redress, and, last but not least, enforcement of consumer rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee agreed to this report with an overwhelming vote of 30 in favour, one against and one abstention.</p>
<p class="contents">Online gambling is an international phenomenon that is growing on a daily basis. Consumers find it easy to gamble online with providers who are either completely unregulated or who are registered in other countries where different rules apply.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, some individual Member States are no longer able to guarantee sufficient protection for their consumers. Children and young people or gambling addicts are particularly affected by this. In addition, frequently illegal foreign competition causes Member States to lose many millions of euro in tax revenue every year.</p>
<p class="contents">This comes at a cost to the promotion of charitable projects, combating addiction and support for amateur sport. Finally, legal uncertainties make it difficult to offer cross-border gambling services within the internal market. Given that there are no European licensing standards, it is necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis whether practices in the Member States comply with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing level of legal uncertainty is made clear by the large number of contractual violation cases in recent years. That is why there is an urgent need to close the existing gap between legislation and reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has come to a clear conclusion. The Member States need to cooperate much more closely on this issue. This will not be enough to resolve the problems outlined, however. In addition, the European Union will also have to play a significant role in future. This has been demanded by our committee with an overwhelming majority. In addition to other measures, an EU directive is also to be considered that will set shared minimum standards for consumer and youth protection, combating crime in the area of online gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the committee emphasises the principle of subsidiarity in its report on online gambling, the Member States need to regulate online betting for themselves insofar as possible within their own territory. However, this means that certain rules will need to be met in accordance with the judicial rulings of the European Court of Justice: restrictions in the legal range of gambling services, through state monopoly for example, are only permitted if they are coherent and proportionate. We cannot have a situation where a state explains away its monopoly by arguing that it wishes to protect consumers from the negative effects of gambling, while at the same time intensively advertising its range of state-backed gambling options. The best example of this can be found in Germany, where we have a state monopoly on gambling and lotteries, but with frequent advertising informing consumers of the current size of the jackpot, naturally encouraging players to invest their money in the lottery.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid such situations in the future, the European Union should set down quality standards for state licensing models. If a Member State decides in favour of a state licensing model, this model must comply with the principles of transparency and fair competition. In other words, all providers of gambling services that comply with the relevant conditions should be able to apply for a licence. At the same time, trust between the national regulatory authorities needs to be strengthened so as to achieve greater cooperation. In addition, the Commission is called upon to examine ways to use legislation to prevent the flow of payments between illegal providers and their customers. This could be achieved, for example, if each Member State were to draw up a white list of licensed gambling operators in its territory. Banks and credit institutions would only then be permitted to authorise transactions with these approved operators. I believe that this is a sensible and realistic alternative to the blocking of Internet sites, something that we, as liberals, would not favour. This measure would also be an important step in securing tax income from legal gambling, combating organised crime, and protecting the consumer from unregulated gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone, regulated providers, the public purse and consumers alike, would benefit from the measures called for in the report. Nonetheless, the European Commission needs the full backing of the European Parliament in order to present the necessary initiatives. It is for this reason I am hopeful that there will be a broad majority in favour at tomorrow’s vote, giving the Commission a clear mandate for action. Mr Barnier, it is over to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On-line gambling does not only cross national borders but also those of the Union. Nevertheless, we need to seek joint methods to protect customers from fraud, to combat money laundering more effectively and to protect young people from gambling, and all this at a European level. Within the framework of this stage, I also believe that different national procedures should be respected but subsidiarity should not hinder close cooperation in the detection of criminal activity, nor should it serve as a pretext for protectionism. Therefore, it is important to delete Article 20. States which restrict licences should provide objective reasons for their failure to comply with national legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, we must take into account cultural traditions, as well as the important sustainable contribution that betting makes to society in some countries, such as mine, through education, culture and sport.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also fight the criminality associated with gambling and protect consumers, especially the most vulnerable, in order to prevent excessive and pathological gambling. This is why I believe that the principle of active subsidiarity based on cooperation between national governments must take precedence in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must be ambitious and focus on developing common regulations and working together in a coordinated fashion against unregulated online gambling operators, which operate without the necessary national licences. We must also ensure transparency and enable non-discriminatory competition that will promote public interest and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must encourage the creation of a network of national organisations to support gambling addicts, which will make it possible to exchange experiences and tried and tested practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The individual judgments of the Court of Justice in cases of infringement, however, cannot be the answer to the challenges of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As this report has stated, in no uncertain terms, Europe’s policy on gambling needs to be clarified by means, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, of better cooperation on the part of the authorities that oversee gambling. To ensure that this happens, it is important that the last clause in point 22 of the report is deleted, as it contradicts the reasoning elsewhere in the document.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, mutual acceptance does not apply to gambling, as gambling games are organised under the aegis of national legislation, which takes account of the special features of Member States. Point 15 in the report states that providers of online gambling should respect national laws, and that Member States should have the right to take the necessary action to prevent illegal gambling. In the future, too, it will be important for Member States to retain the right to decide on their own levels of consumer protection and measures to prevent criminality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the basis for granting an exclusive right to provide gambling games is the prevention of social harm and combating crime in the gambling sector. That is why it is very important to ensure that gambling can be ethically sustainable. It is important that point 44 at the end of the report is kept and that the matter is addressed in greater depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the Member States can, to a certain extent, determine the degree of regulation required in their own territory, it must be in accordance with the regulations of the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, operators of games of chance from other states, which have an open market and low tax rates, are also available in states where online gambling is forbidden. Besides that, a non-regulated black market is also operating on the Internet. Online gambling sites are also widely accessible to under-aged children or to people susceptible to pathological gambling.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have to search for a proper framework for the responsible regulation of this environment. The European Court of Justice has already taken a decision that gambling does not belong to ordinary services and its regulation in accordance with the appropriately set goals is admissible. It would therefore be useful to define the minimum standards for the protection of consumers in the field of online gambling in order to enable more rigorous legal action to be taken against these types of activities in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is to say, not applying the principle of mutual recognition in a sector and market that are different from others, namely online gambling, and, at the same time, complying with the principle of active subsidiarity, thereby also increasing and strengthening cooperation between national regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that a European approach is needed for a number of areas, notably for anti-fraud measures, the protection of minors and combating illegal operators and addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also important that the integrity of sport is addressed, in order to ensure the equitable distribution of revenues generated. In this regard, I asked for and obtained the mention of betting rights, a type of property rights for the organisers of sports events which can be enforced with regard to online betting operators. These rights would safeguard financial revenues for sports providers and thus avoid the increased risk of corruption or fraud in sport.</p>

Pathological gambling is extremely hazardous and its social costs are enormous, too. This addiction may affect as many as 5.5% of citizens of the European Union, which means we are talking about several million European citizens. I therefore regard the protection of consumers and the prevention of pathological gambling as a basic requirement. I think it is important to adopt common European regulations leading to the effective protection of vulnerable groups, in particular young people, who are the most exposed to this kind of danger. Member States should cooperate much more closely with each other in this area, in particular, while combating the negative aspects of gambling. As such, I am happy to see that the report contains, amongst other things, an appeal to the Commission and the Member States to focus on research on the prevalence, origin and treatment of addiction to these forms of gambling. A combination of the prevention of negative aspects and effective help to the victims of gambling is the only possible way to actively prevent Internet gambling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is important because it will give a clear signal to Commissioner Barnier, who I know is extremely interested in this, about the areas where the Commission can move forward in the framework of active subsidiarity. I think that is a great word that has come out of this report, which does not undermine the ability of every Member State to regulate gambling in its tradition and in its history, but, at the same time, places an obligation on Member States to say that if you do not intensify your cooperation together, then consumers will not be properly looked after in every country. We are entitled to demand that safety and security for consumers and protection for under-age and addictive gambling; those two things absolutely must go together, and I hope we can make some serious progress on this as a result of the work that Parliament has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, 18 months ago, I promised you that I would open a wide-ranging consultation on the very important issue of online gambling. Today, we return to that subject, and I personally would like to come back to it by expressing my firm commitment to translating the main conclusions into action, beyond and after the consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">We received over 250 responses which, along with the five expert workshops we organised, and the lively debates you yourselves have had, ladies and gentlemen, on the own-initiative report by Mr Creutzmann, clearly show a desire to see concrete steps taken at European level towards establishing a basic regulatory framework that respects that which Mr Harbour called – and which I too would like to mention – active subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Creutzmann for his commitment, and Ms Schaldemose, Ms Rühle, Mr Abad, Mr de Jong and Mr Fox for the contributions they have made to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report testifies to your broad consensus on the assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the online environment, no Member State is in a position to guarantee the protection of consumers and citizens by itself. I am echoing what my fellow Commissioner and friend, Mr Dalli, said earlier on the more general issue of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, all consumers and citizens – and particularly young people and minors, as Ms Roithová said earlier – should be able to enjoy a minimum level of equal and effective protection, no matter what kind of gambling platform they use.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, while every Member State is free to determine its own market’s level of deregulation, in accordance with the principle of coherence, it is clear that we are gradually moving towards a controlled deregulation of numerous markets, as Mr Abad very succinctly described earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the absence of legal offerings in Europe, Europeans gamble and will continue to gamble on illegal third-country websites, which are not protected and are open to all kinds of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we should be careful to offer attractive conditions for online gambling operators, taking account of the consequences of what I have just said, if we wish to both protect players and prevent fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we need to act, because this sector is booming. In 2010, it generated EUR 8.5 billion in revenue, a figure that could reach EUR 13 billion in 2015. This may account for only 14% of the betting market in the EU, but Europe still makes up 45% of the world’s online gambling market. We need to support this sector as it expands while, at the same time, taking care to monitor it. What road map might we and should we use to respond to all your questions and all these challenges?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear. We are not talking about harmonisation; we are looking at joint action on certain key issues, which will no doubt lead us towards a basic common regulatory framework, as I have already said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention six key areas in which we are going to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a dialogue between national regulators. We know that there is a lack of cooperation between national regulators, which probably stems from a lack of mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from a few bilateral agreements and a recent attempt to create a common platform, there is no culture of cooperation between national regulators. On the contrary, I have noticed that there has often been, and I repeat, a lack of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">However, without a new, additional degree of mutual trust, no progress will be made at European level in strengthening controls and safeguarding players, particularly the young.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priority should therefore be to make European regulators work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point: a minimum standard of protection. We have to guarantee a high level of protection for every European citizen and, I repeat, particularly for young people, in order to move forward in this area. We will have to make online gambling professionals, who are currently self-regulated, and regulators, who, I would point out, apply different standards, work together. There is, consequently, a general requirement for greater clarity and legal certainty, and you put that across in your report, Mr Creutzmann.</p>
<p class="contents">The third key issue: the fight against fraud. There has been a broad consensus, in this consultation and in what you have been saying here, in favour of extending the scope of the directive on the prevention of money laundering so that it covers the entire online gambling sector rather than just casinos, as is currently the case. That would represent a significant step forward in monitoring the sector at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth important point is addiction. Ms Irigoyen Pérez and Ms Sehnalová mentioned this earlier. We cannot talk seriously about consumer protection without recognising the need for further studies and research into the scientific data on gambling and addiction. We need to make full use of our research capacities on what can be considered at times a minor issue, although I do not see it as such.</p>
<p class="contents">The integrity of sport is the fifth key aspect. Mr Creutzmann, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted your interest in the matter of fraud in sport, and I share your desire to help find effective solutions, including the idea of defining sporting fraud at EU level and even of criminalising it. I believe it is an interesting idea but one that would be difficult to implement. We cannot address this issue by improvising. It requires a great deal of legal and technical work, and I am working on this with my fellow Commissioners who are directly involved, particularly Ms Reding, Ms Vassiliou and, of course, the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Dalli.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that progress will have to be made if, as Mr Abad mentioned, sporting organisations are to cooperate more with operators and regulators in order to prevent match fixing.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth area to work on is ensuring that national systems comply with the Treaties. I would like to answer Mr Takkula on this point, because he mentioned the European Court of Justice, which is quite clear on the restrictions that can be justified in the public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in order to make progress in this area, Mr Takkula, we will need to clarify what distinguishes a legal gambling offering from an illegal one. This raises the question of compliance of national systems with the Treaties. The Commission will shoulder its responsibilities in this area as in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Creutzmann, based on these key issues, your comments, your proposals and your report, how are we going to tackle this?</p>
<p class="contents">My own initial inclination would be to promote cooperation between regulators, and in the coming weeks I intend to personally organise and hold a meeting with all the national regulators in order to establish a climate of trust, which does not really exist at the moment, and to lay the foundations of that cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as one might expect, that cooperation between regulators enables us to move forward on the key subjects we have talked about, but especially if it highlights the need for additional action, then we will work towards a second stage, which could, as Mr Paška requested, be based on regulatory initiatives, and create minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I want to be very clear on this issue. I am a Member of the College of European Commissioners, and I have to work with all my colleagues and encourage them to share that conviction. We will quickly embark on the first stage, which I already mentioned: regulators working together. Following that initial assessment and effort, I will have to share with my colleagues my belief in the need to go further, as I have just expressed, particularly in terms of drawing up basic regulatory initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore be important to work through these stages one by one. Therefore, now that I have set out the main issues we are facing, I shall begin my work in the light of your report, Mr Creutzmann, and I intend to propose a plan of specific actions, which I shall submit to the European Commission in mid-2012, once the College has debated and reached a decision on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am infinitely grateful to you, Mr Creutzmann, and to you, ladies and gentlemen, for this report, which is going to enlighten, guide and strengthen the Commission in its forthcoming work.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a collective responsibility: to help Member States to regulate online gambling; to safeguard consumers, particularly young people; to develop legal offerings; and to fight effectively and jointly against fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">You can be sure of my determination in all these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowadays, about 10% – a figure which is rising – of all gambling in Europe takes place online, with a market volume in excess of EUR 10 billion. As a result of ever increasing offerings and the increasing number of gamblers, the current market fragmentation in this area in Europe is also becoming ever more obvious. In a host of Member States, there are total bans or bans with the possibility of authorisation, while others have a completely liberalised market. Furthermore, in view of the cross-border nature of the Internet, Member States alone are not in a position to regulate all areas of online gambling. In my view, much-expanded cooperation between national regulatory bodies is therefore essential. In addition, I agree with the rapporteur that what is needed are institutionalised collaborative arrangements, also on the basis of the Internal Market Information System, in order to share information efficiently and quickly. As far as the battle against the growing black market on the Internet is concerned, I believe that national regulators must be given the necessary powers to penalise infringements and act against illegal providers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disadvantages which emanate from an unregulated gambling market are greater than those encountered in a more regulated and uniform one. Therefore, any action plan must factor in extra precautions geared towards meeting the challenges and countering the elements of risk posed by the online environment in terms of the safeguard of minors, player protection, payment security and data protection of individuals engaged in Internet gambling, as well as ensuring that fair competition for operators duly licensed in other Member States is guaranteed in each Member State. I am unable to support the endorsement of national restrictions vis-à-vis the online gambling sector, which could have an adverse effect on gaming operators that are duly licensed as aforementioned and wish to operate cross-border. The term ‘illegal’, which remains undefined throughout the text, is unacceptable as it gives rise to legal ambiguity and encourages Member States to take protectionist measures in the online gambling sector, further increasing the fragmentation of the market. I therefore propose that a common definition based on the European Commission Green Paper is attributed to the concept of ‘illegal’ at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title21"></a><a name="creitem21"></a>

The directorate general of the European Commission produced an excellent communication; I used it as the basis for my report and have tried to develop it further. I would like the Commission, the Member States and those concerned in the beekeeping sector to actually implement the many concrete proposals set out in this report. It is not primarily European honey production that is at stake. Through pollination, the beekeeping sector offers vital services to agriculture as a whole and contributes to biodiversity. If it were not for the activities of bees and other pollinators, 85% of agricultural crops would not exist. In other words, the beekeeping sector provides vital environmental public goods, and this is why we need to use Community resources to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that for decades, medicines have been in short supply. The big pharmaceutical companies lack sufficient interest in developing new medicinal products, while the beekeeping industry does not have enough money to support the development of new honeybee health products. This is a problem that has gone on for decades. If we cannot make progress on these issues using Community resources, then the crisis currently affecting the European and global beekeeping sector will not be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The other major problem is that the sector is not sufficiently well organised. Reliable statistical data on honeybee health, and even on the number of hives or colonies, are lacking. So it would be vital to have reliable figures to work with, at both Member State and European Union level. Another big problem is that many beekeepers lack professional competence. It would be very important for Member States to make beekeeping subject to some kind of professional training requirement. I consider it very important to assess the effect of plant protection on honeybee health problems, which is the most controversial issue. There are those in Parliament who would like to lay all the blame on plant protection products; I disagree with this. Others, meanwhile, try to play down their impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, certain forces prevented me from including in my report details of which plant protection products are particularly harmful and which active substances in these products could be substituted by other active substances less harmful to honeybee health. I am referring to neonicotinoid pesticides and, in future, I will be fighting alongside friends campaigning for environmental protection and bee protection to have these substances removed from plant protection products wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission to modify the Honey Directive because quality parameters for honey are not adequately defined under the current provisions and this means that we are unable to take appropriate action against adulterators and the adulteration of honey. Quality issues relating to imported honey are also a problem. Last, the extent to which genetically modified, or genetically engineered, crops are harmful or not is also the subject of major controversy.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the European Commission to commission at last a research study that is reliable, objective and scientific, as this is not a matter of feelings but of science. At present, no such study exists. With regard to antibiotics, meanwhile, I call upon Commissioner Dalli to legislate on this issue at EU level. In the case of meat products, for example, there are set limits for antibiotic residue content, despite the fact that we consume much more meat than honey. There is no such provision in the case of honey. It would be good to resolve this at EU level. Finally, Albert Einstein once said, and I thought this was an exaggeration, that if the world’s bees were to perish, then humans would perish within four years too. He may have been speaking figuratively, but in the light of what we now know about the huge impact of beekeeping in terms of securing food production and maintaining biodiversity, I believe we should listen to Albert Einstein’s advice. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he pointed out, Einstein certainly knew how important it was. His quotation is well worth recalling, and indeed highlighting, because if 85% of species are dependent on pollination and the bee dies out, then that is the end of it. Certainly Einstein was quite right in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of issues here which have to be looked at. The Department of Agriculture has been successful in Ireland in preserving our native bee species by not allowing foreign species to be imported. I think it is very important that the purity of various species is preserved because this is a huge issue. Also, in terms of the economy, if we can increase the importance of honey as part of a stable diet, we could certainly also look at that to improve the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a mistake however. Albert Einstein once said that humanity would be able to survive for only four years without bees. Mortality among bees affects agriculture, rural development, food production, the maintenance of biodiversity and, ultimately, our lives. Speaking for Austria, I can tell you that there has been a 30% decline in the bee population in some regions. It is important that this phenomenon should be researched.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of this programme of research and studies; however, this must not be our only measure. We need specific controls through agricultural supports and a strict authorisation process for plant protection products. After all, it is not just the Varroa mite that is causing the honey bee to die out – modern agriculture also plays a significant role here. For this reason, more financial support should be made available for research into improving the health of our bee population, prevention, effective and standardised medicines in the Member States and alternative options to clinical insecticides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when I read this report, I see no real fundamental criticism being levelled at how our agricultural model is currently working. The solution is even being sought through giving encouragement to the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture even more drugs, though we know that is the root of the problem, or in planting a couple of flower borders around agricultural fields. As if that is going to solve the problem!</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, an alternative resolution, with a clearer criticism and a clearer focus on our precautionary principle. This demands that the neonicotinoids be removed from the market for the time being, because they have all too often been shown to be involved. That has to be done now. We also have to look very carefully at genetically modified drugs. There is enough evidence now to apply the precautionary principle. That is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is that we need to change our agricultural model. We need more crop rotation and fewer monocultures. Those issues must be thoroughly addressed. Only then will we really be able to solve the problem afflicting bees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows that this Communication has been instrumental in forging a better understanding of this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Our initial assessment remains valid. The health of bees is strongly affected by various factors while to date, science has not yet determined the exact causes or the extent of bee loss.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me express here my appreciation for the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Tabajdi, who has produced a balanced report on this complex area.</p>
<p class="contents">The many factors affecting bee health are reflected in the report. Unfortunately, we agree that there are no quick and easy fixes, no one single solution, but it is clear that our research efforts need to be stepped up. We will pay attention to this in the selection of future research programmes, and we can fine-tune those elements which appear most influential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already completed several key actions, such as the designation of an EU reference laboratory for bee health and an increase in the EU’s contribution to the financing of the national apiculture programmes. I appreciate Parliament’s support for these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Other actions are already planned. Parliament’s report certainly gives us food for thought on those items and on many more additional points. I can assure the honourable Members that we will look into all your suggestions with close attention. I am confident that our action will place us in a better position to decide on the best actions and strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you, however, that the Commission has limited resources and tools. Member States and stakeholders have an important role to play. This could mean, for instance, investing further efforts in developing and putting on the market veterinary medicines. Similarly, Member States and stakeholder organisations could further promote good apiculture and agricultural practices, facilitate the dialogue between crop producers and beekeepers, and disseminate practical information to beekeepers.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, may I say that I very much appreciate Parliament’s valuable report and look forward to continuing to make further progress on this important matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to this, it provides a livelihood for more than 600 000 EU citizens. This is why the agricultural value of beekeeping is strategic, as the success of food production itself depends upon pollination by bees. European beekeeping is suffering from the sporadic loss of entire bee colonies, and the reasons for these losses have so far not been adequately identified. The mass death of bees is most probably caused by high levels of environmental pollution and the widespread use of pesticides and antibiotics in agriculture. Genetically modified plants may also play a part in the loss of bee colonies. This view is reinforced by the fact that the manufacturers of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) do not participate in research on the effects of GMOs on bees. It would be of great benefit for beekeeping if the EU again reviewed and regulated the permitted and prohibited types of agricultural pesticides and fertilisers at the earliest opportunity. I welcome the Commission’s intention to publish its website in all language versions for dialogue and information-exchange between beekeepers of all Member States and regions and also between professional and amateur beekeepers. I am in favour of special programmes of financial aid for starter and young beekeepers across the EU and support for keeping original species of bees, which have been genetically more resistant to viruses and mites. A greater variety of bee species could be extremely beneficial to the situation in both the beekeeping and agriculture sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what I find more important for our food supply than just quality honey is the role of bees as pollinators. Bees are tiny, but essential for agriculture and our ecosystem. I would like to reiterate today that this Parliament should not ignore any possible cause of the massive bee deaths, no matter how forceful – and, I fear, no matter how effective – the industry lobby might be. That means that we need to search intensively for the origin of the parasite, for the Varroa mite. Nor should we be quick to rule out the lethal impact of ‘plant protection products’ – in other words pesticides – nor, indeed, the broad consequences of GMO cultivation and its monocultures, the radiation of GSM traffic, climate change or particulate matter from diesel engines which could subtly disrupt the navigation of bees. Given the great importance of environmental protection and food safety, which is what is at stake here, it is inappropriate of this House to laugh off the possible consequences. Producers, including those of genetically modified material, should not hinder scientific research, but cooperate with it.

In Central Europe, the biodiversity of flora is relatively well preserved, and it enables high-quality flower honey to be produced, and also meadow honey, without making bigger investments. Under such circumstances, this sector is able to supply honey as a truly natural product suitable for consumption by our citizens. The prices are, of course, higher than in certain parts of the world outside of Europe, but in the end, its higher and purer quality is also a supplementary source of nutrition for the population.</p>
<p class="contents">An excessive openness of the market to products from other countries would result in the inability of beekeepers to compete with the pressure of cheaper but not really top quality honey originating from professionally operated beekeeping farms outside of Europe, where the use of antibiotics is allowed. In the event of it not being possible to preserve the native bee family lines, there would be the danger of their replacement with bee family lines or kinds which cannot be admissible in countries with a high population density, with a subsequent negative effect on biodiversity and also on the health of bees.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a situation could cause serious damage to the interests of our beekeepers. Central Europe has all the conditions for producing high-quality honey as a natural product. Any potential further quantitative needs may be covered by imports from other parts of the world under clearly defined conditions and with appropriate labelling for domestic consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title22"></a><a name="creitem22"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kerstin Westphal, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic change is one of the most important themes in our times. For example, we know that every second girl born in Germany today will live to see their 100th birthday. My 13-year-old daughter was happy when she heard this news. However politicians must naturally also respond to this fact, drawing conclusions and establishing general political conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, which will be the subject of a vote tomorrow, deals with some of these conclusions and the associated general conditions. It does not deal with social issues such as pensions. This is quite simply beyond the remit of the Committee on Regional Development. What it does consider, however, is the question of what European cohesion policy can do and how we can organise future cohesion policy in order to respond to the pressing issues. I would like to draw attention to four areas mentioned in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: we need to tailor European cohesion policy more closely than ever to demographic change. Demographic change continues to play quite an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy and in the legislative proposals. Now, as we come to implement the strategy, we must ensure that the topic remains on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area relates to infrastructure: we need infrastructure suitable to the needs of older people in order to avoid social exclusion. This includes accessibility to public buildings, for example. This move would also benefit other groups, such as families with small children or people with disabilities. At the same time, we need to make areas affected by emigration more attractive, particularly to young families.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area relates to older people, children and families. More and more older people live in the various regions of Europe. Regional policy must respond to this fact. For me, this also means promoting so-called multi-generational housing, as well as European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) support in the social and health care sectors. Also, when it comes to the prevention of emigration, I believe that well-qualified full-time day care for children plays a very important role. It is a pity that the majority in the committee were not in favour of providing free child care. I would have liked to see much more courage here.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth area of concern is employment. Our prime concern here must be to combat unemployment among women and young people. We have a cohort of young women who are the best-educated generation in Europe of all time. If these women are denied employment opportunities, then we could be accused of being responsible ourselves for creating the shortage of specialist professionals. It is also important that we should make much more use of the knowledge and experience of older people. Appropriate structures must also be established for this purpose in the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we all agree that we need to take an active approach by shaping demographic change rather than just managing it. European regional policy can make a huge contribution here. I would like to thank all the members of the committee who have worked on this report. This has been a long journey and several people have grown old and even retired while the work went on. The result has been worth the effort, however. I think we have produced a good report and I hope that the majority will vote in favour at tomorrow’s plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is intended to find a solution to the needs of an ageing generation. It mentions only superficially the measures which could help to increase birth rates. In regions with dwindling populations, families with a higher number of children represent a valuable asset. Despite this fact, the report proposes measures that contribute to the break-up of families – full-day programmes for children or increasing irrational quotas on the gainful employment of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights also proposed including in the report a requirement to evaluate the invisible work of women; in caring for family members, managing the household and bringing up and educating children. We proposed that Eurostat investigate the importance of the family as regards cohesion policy. We wanted this report to recognise the unpaid work of women when calculating health insurance and pensions. Unfortunately, none of these proposals have been accepted, which is why I sometimes see this report as social engineering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These changes in our population levels and patterns have brought a number of challenges and opportunities with them. We must make sure we are able to address these challenges and take advantage of these opportunities. Member States can use the Structural Funds to develop strategies to manage demographic change. We must ensure that we have up-to-date information on demographic changes within our Member States and especially within the different regions in our states. This information can then be used for the redistribution of Structural Funds to the areas in greatest need. Housing upkeep and social integration of the elderly in Ireland and elsewhere certainly must be a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Britain is now undergoing a massive population explosion which, until very recently, went unreported. When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, we had a population of just over 58 million. That population has now grown to over 62.4 million and, on current trends, the population will grow to over 70 million by 2030 and thereafter spiral ever upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Demographers calculate that all this unsustainable population growth is down to migration and births to migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing wrong with some appropriate, moderate and sustainable immigration, but the UK is adding over one million people to its net population every four to five years. England is more densely populated than India, China and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Britain does not have a cohesion policy, but if it did, it would leave the European Union and regain control of its borders and its immigration policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increasing life expectancy in the European Union, of course, makes me happy. However, as far as the low birth rate is concerned, I am aware of the need to review many European and national policies, above all, in the fields of health care, pension systems, support for families and intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised that the authors here are not able to generally support complete families consisting of a father and a mother, because it is crystal clear that many more children are born in such families than in single-parent families or in any other type of cohabitation.</p>

This is why it is extremely important that a debate is held on the demographic changes and the latest trends at a regional and local level.

I had the opportunity to be shadow rapporteur on this subject. Europe’s society is ageing and it has the lowest population growth rate in the world. The Commission stresses the importance of demographic change. It is, of course, a threat, but also an opportunity. In their operational programmes for the 2007-2013 programming period, the Member States plan to spend 8.5% of structural fund appropriations. Regional policy is therefore a key instrument in tackling demographic change. There thus has to be coordination at all levels for a more flexible structural assistance policy, and local authorities and local communities need to be more involved in decision making. Demographic change is a complex issue, and it is therefore equally important for there to be balanced consideration of the needs of children, young families and the elderly. The report focuses more on ways of putting out the fire, but the preventative measures mentioned must also be implemented effectively, and in the future, we will still have to review pension systems which were established and worked effectively at a time when demographic trends were quite different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I warmly welcome the own-initiative report of our colleague, Ms Westphal. The European population is ageing; average life expectancy is increasing and birth rates are declining. Demographic change is often regarded as a problem; however, it may lead to new challenges in many regions of the European Union. Regions and cities, however, need their own initiatives and strategies, but guidelines and coordination are also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional policy is a key instrument for solving the problem of demographic change, so I am voting for the draft reform of the structural policy, where I think it is important to establish a social infrastructure and help for the ageing population. Of course, I also welcome the plans for urban development and the strategy for care for every generation; it is also important to provide adequate support for children, young people, the middle-aged and the older generation and families by ensuring their active participation in the life of the community.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is necessary to focus on the more vulnerable sections of the community – children, school-leavers, the unemployed, women, people in poverty, immigrants and elderly people. For such a policy to be effective, of course, the coordination of bodies at all levels is essential as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, we have a low birth rate and a high percentage of migrants, consisting mainly of young people moving from rural areas to large, wealthy cities. The author of the report believes that structural policy in particular should take up the huge challenges posed by demographic change and suggests six main focuses. I will concentrate on three of them. Firstly, the Structural Funds must be better adapted to the challenges of demographic change. Demographic indicators should be used for the regional distribution of Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the rapporteur identifies major challenges for both rural areas and urban areas with regard to infrastructure. Depopulation and the social exclusion of the elderly need to be prevented, and urban planning must adapt. Structural Funds can help here. Cities and municipalities must be attractive to their residents, including by means of child- and family-friendly infrastructure and good local public transport. Increasing the female employment rate is a core issue for handling demographic change. Youth unemployment must also be reduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report represents a precious contribution for the European Commission. As the report acknowledges, there are great differences in the demographic trends in Europe which some regions are going to experience. Therefore, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach will not work.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy already supports demographic change through actions such as active labour market policies, investment in entrepreneurship, modernisation of social and health sector infrastructures, kindergartens and housing, as well as support for the economic and social integration of immigrants and minorities. Regional responses to demographic change should address the challenges through integrated approaches. The cohesion policy legislative package for the period 2014-2020, adopted by the Commission on 6 October, will offer a framework to fund a wide variety of investments to tackle demographic change.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Commission has adopted a number of common provisions for the three funds included in the package: the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Cohesion Fund. The provisions related to the local development approach, integrated territorial investment and sustainable urban development will allow further flexibility and additional possibilities for funding to address demographic change at regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">Active and healthy ageing is critical for a sustainable European society. In order to face the demographic trend to a further ageing population, the EU has to reduce the differences in terms of health and must contribute to improving access to health services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now drawing up a common strategic framework that will cover the three funds mentioned, plus the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Fisheries Fund. The framework will translate the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy into key actions that will be supported by the different funds. It will address the multi-dimensional aspects of demographic change and will determine how the different funds can better collaborate in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the European Union, this same advance is being used as a pretext for imposing retrograde measures: in other words, for calling into question the rights and entitlements won by the workers and the people of various countries, such as social security systems. At the same time, many of the challenges are not being met as they should: these certainly include the challenges of cohesion policy, regional development, the fight against desertification, and the strengthening and diversification of public services, to name but a few. This report deals with the important question of using Structural Funds, namely, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund, in order to face up to some of these challenges, especially in the countries and regions worst affected by ageing and depopulation. An increase in the absorption rate of these funds is crucial, and all the more important if we realise that many of these countries and regions are confronted with unacceptable so-called austerity programmes which shrink investment to poverty levels, impeding the full use of the funds by those who most need them and at the very moment when they need them more than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The actions required to resolve its adverse consequences are one of the main tasks facing the EU. An ageing population requires suitable measures for increasing the opportunities for elderly people to participate actively in society, for using their knowledge and experience, and for providing them with a decent existence. At the same time, it is also important to increase the support for women and young people by providing them with better access to training, qualifications and labour market integration, and ensuring a work-life balance. Efforts are still required to improve living conditions and the level of employment in every region and to foster their specific potential so as to avoid a high concentration of population in some areas and depopulation of others. The opportunities for curbing the adverse consequences of demographic change should be analysed and used, including support from the cohesion policy instruments. Good coordination among measures funded by the ESF, ERDF and EAFRD would significantly help tackle these problems. I think that additional technical assistance needs to be provided to the hardest hit regions to ensure that they have sufficient capacity to implement Structural Funds projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States are faced with intense pressure from the markets, which doubt our ability to return to healthy growth and reduce our deficits. Therefore, it is not the time to ‘spend more’ but to ‘spend better’. Europe can no longer afford to waste taxpayers’ money on needless grants. It should be the driver of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Cohesion policy, still too underrated, could provide leverage for the effective investment needed for the embodiment of European solidarity and for the portrayal of a Europe that works to achieve growth and development across its Member States. I would like to raise two points. Simplification must be a central tenet of the next programming period. While the ex ante and ex post conditions can ensure greater efficiency of funds, in no case should they increase the amount of red tape that recipients face. In addition, the Europe 2020 strategy will only be effective if it receives political support across all levels of governance and from the citizens. I am disappointed that culture, sport and industrial policy were regrettably missing from the proposed thematic menu. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Population ageing, the decline in the young population in rural areas and the massive pressure on large towns are just some aspects of the problem. The Structural Funds have earmarked funds of EUR 30 billion for the regions for the period from 2007-2013 for actions in connection with demographic change. Within this framework, we need to find ways of optimising and making effective use of these funds. However, the challenges of demographic change cannot be addressed under a single EU policy. Actions are needed not only in the employment and infrastructure sectors, but also in the fields of education, health care, social benefits, social innovation, immigration policy and action to reconcile family life and work. Within this framework, therefore, the demand that we have repeatedly voiced in the European Parliament for stronger synergies between all EU policies and the corresponding funds is proving to be of vital importance. It is only through coordinated actions that we can formulate comprehensive responses to multi-dimensional problems such as the problem of demographic change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paradoxically, despite the worldwide increase in the birth rate, Europe is ageing, and the name ‘the old continent’ is becoming painfully literal. Population decline in Europe would be even more pronounced were it not for migration – more people settle in the Union than leave it, but this gives us a false sense of security because too few native Europeans are being born, too few to ensure our demographic security and reverse the trend of our ageing society. We should ask ourselves why this problem is affecting Europe and whether we can do anything about it.</p>
<p class="contents">One should not explain the problem of an ageing Europe without taking account of the increase in the average life expectancy of Europeans, which is indeed a pleasing phenomenon. Nevertheless, the main problem is the dramatic decline in the number of births. This problem is certainly not solved by the influx of immigrants. The core of the problem lies in the shift away from Christian values in Europe since the Second World War, especially as regards promoting the family. Instead of encouraging motherhood and fatherhood, the family has been sacrificed over the years in favour of so-called free relationships, abortion on demand, and even euthanasia in some countries. Today, we are reaping the poisoned fruits of this policy: a falling birth rate, an ageing society and the collapse of the pension system in Europe. To reverse this worrying trend, which will lead to the extinction of Europe, we must return to Christian values in Europe and resolutely support the family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Simon, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public services are a fundamental pillar of our European social model and not only play a key role for the individual citizen, but are also of enormous importance for the wellbeing of society at large. For this reason, the following question should be uppermost in our minds when we come to reform the EU State aid rules on services of general economic interest. What conditions are needed to ensure the highest possible service quality and, on the other hand, to guarantee universal access for all levels within the population?</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the provision and organisation of such high-quality public services is certainty among service providers and public authorities in relation to the general legal conditions, on the one hand, and greater proportionality in the regulations, on the other, so that more attention is paid to the diversity of the various kinds of public service and so that administrative effort is reduced. Thus, the EU State aid rules can only be reformed if the special function of public services is taken into account and if the subsidiarity principle is strictly observed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a legal framework for public services should be established for a sufficient degree of legal certainty. For us in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the legal basis for this would be Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as we know, opinion in the European Parliament has been divided on this issue for many years. Nonetheless, we believe that this report has succeeded in its objective of finding a compromise that could be accepted by almost all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The administrative effort involved in managing compensatory payments to those providing public services is currently too high. This is particularly true for small authorities and service providers. The increase we have called for in the thresholds for exemption from mandatory notification of the European Commission when claiming compensatory payments would provide initial relief. The State aid rules must be designed so that the administrative effort expended by the local authorities and service providers is proportionate to the potential impact on the internal European market and on competition. The special <span class="italic">de minimis</span> arrangements we propose provide an important basis for this, involving a general exception to the regulations for purely local services and social services.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure that we cater more precisely to the special role of social services, we would call for a clear definition and protection of their function and character. In addition, our report also clearly rejects the proposal from the European Commission that efficiency criteria should be introduced for services of general interest as a prerequisite for establishing their compatibility with EU competition rules. The European Commission is going beyond its remit here, as it is simply responsible for controlling State aid. On the other hand, the definition of economic conditions is solely a matter for the Member States and can only be regulated on a European level with the cooperation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to close by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for excellent cross-party cooperation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The clear vote in favour of my report at committee level is evidence of this results-based, solutions-oriented cooperation. I am therefore confident that in tomorrow’s plenary vote, we shall also succeed in sending out a clear signal from the European Parliament to the European Commission demanding sustainable, future-proofed general conditions in the area of public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

State aid should stimulate local entrepreneurship and the local economy, and help to create jobs at local level. There is a need to upgrade the infrastructure and ensure that access to it is not limited, especially in the regions where it is most lacking.

Commissioners, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Simon for taking a cross-party approach and, above all, for his great commitment to his report. He has succeeded in framing a demand that the Commission should present a communication containing specific measures by the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the drawback that Mr Simon has also already mentioned. Of course Parliament must also be included in the legislative process according to Article 14. The Commission is constantly calling for transparency from all participants in the process, while itself endeavouring to use its political clout to rush through its opinions in the policy-making processes. The fact is, however, that Europe operates on a grass-roots basis, taking its cue from local and regional authorities. It is therefore very surprising to find that the people in the regions and the local decision makers are often pointedly attacked and marginalised by the policies pursued by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This Community framework meddles in the authority of the Member States to define and organise their own parameters. It is for this reason that I wish to draw attention to the principle of ‘united in diversity’ that operates within the European Union and to call on the Commission to pay a little more attention to Article 14 and to the options that this permits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is necessary to support the Commission in its attempt to track legislative rules in the Member States. I think we should insist on the simplification of rules for the uptake of State aid and support the Commission in its efforts to introduce, within the framework of opportunities provided through subsidiarity, a greater level of transparency and checks on the proportionality of the level of subsidies. In particular, higher-volume state or communal procurements for public service companies are frequently the source of a high level of corruption. However, the Commission, too, should amend its procedures and eliminate suspicion and complaints about disproportionate subsidies and corruption on a much more consistent basis. The Commission often tends to dispense with formality and relies mainly on the opinions of ministerial officials, who conceal the disproportionate or unauthorised level of state subsidies in ad-hoc reports. I personally have seen evidence of this while reading the replies to my questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are convinced that public services play a key role in the European social model because they make an important contribution to social stability and territorial cohesion. This is why services of general economic interest are one of the key priorities in the State aid field during our mandate. We are glad that there is such an intense debate going on about this topic between Parliament, other EU institutions and all stakeholders. We particularly welcome Parliament’s contribution to this debate. It reflects the importance which Parliament attaches to establishing a clear legal framework for services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that our reform is based on three objectives: clarification, simplification and a more diversified approach. We set out these objectives in detail in our Communication in March. Since then, we have published draft texts that show how we think the objectives should be translated into rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The reply to the public consultation on the draft texts has been rich and fruitful. The direction of the reform is broadly shared by all, although stakeholders have different views on the details of the changes. This is why, in the coming weeks, we will work to further improve on the delivery of the three objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the European Parliament could not have come at a better time. It has been able to take account of our draft texts and thus to provide us suggestions on how to further improve our texts. It will prove a particularly valuable contribution to the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly focus on three points in Mr Simon’s report:</p>
<p class="contents">A major tool for simplification in our reform is the new <span class="italic">de minimis</span> regulation. The report suggests that a threshold based on the size of the municipality is not necessary to restrict the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> regulation to small local services, and that a three-year approach would be more flexible than the current one-year threshold. As I have already emphasised, no decision has yet been taken as to what kind of thresholds are most appropriate. We are open to suggestions and appreciate the views of all stakeholders, in particular, the European Parliament’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report requests that additional social services be covered by the decision. Social services play a very important role in our society and there is less need for very strict scrutiny. This is why, under the more diversified approach, they benefit from exemption from notification and more lenient compatibility criteria of the decision. I am open to assessing evidence and arguments to improve the scope and treatment of social services where justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Parliament considers that the Commission cannot define efficiency criteria under State aid rules. Let me underline that the current drafts do not require undertakings to be efficient, nor do they allow the Commission to check for efficiency. The draft texts only require that undertakings be given incentives to improve their efficiency. I know that some of you are nevertheless afraid of such a change. However, those efficiency incentives only apply to large commercial SGEIs that we assess under the framework. They are also largely supported by service providers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall again why we are so keen to improve our rules: in the present situation, given the tight budgetary constraints of all Member States, we want everyone to be given the possibility to continue enjoying accessible, affordable and efficient public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much once again for your contribution to this reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public services meet the daily needs of Europeans and play an important role in ensuring equal opportunities and respect for fundamental rights. The European Commission is seeking to simplify the State aid rules applicable to services of general economic interest, including public transport management, the supply of water and heating, the construction of social housing and the provision of postal services. The introduction of simplified legislative rules in this area would reduce the administrative burden on public authorities. However, future reform must not jeopardise universal access to services which mitigate the social impact of the economic crisis, thereby protecting the vulnerable, under the pretext of making processes more efficient. A narrower definition of the category of services of general economic interest and the establishment of low thresholds for the volume of compensation permitted would facilitate the liberalisation of public services, and the liberalisation of public services does mean sacrificing the rights of citizens and deepening economic inequalities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, SGEI also contribute significantly to the economic performance and competitiveness of the Member States, which seems to be very important from the perspective of current problems in the euro area. Last but not least, SGEI facilitate the successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and should enable development targets to be reached, in particular, in the fields of employment, education and social inclusion. I welcome the intention of the Commission as regards their simplification, greater clarity and greater proportionality. In the social services sector, I believe that it is of crucial importance that in the case of social services of general economic interest which are locally limited due to their character, special higher threshold levels of compensation be introduced, with a negligible effect on trade between Member States. Finally, I am also in favour of general exceptions from the reporting obligation in other fields of social services of general economic interest, for example, in the arrangement of care for elderly and disabled citizens and health care. In general, I believe that the report submitted by Peter Simon analyses this particular issue with great professionalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
